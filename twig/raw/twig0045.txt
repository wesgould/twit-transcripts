[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.920]   This week in Google to show the coverage,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   it's the Google and the Cloudverse.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   And here with us, well-versed in clouds,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.440]   Gina Trapani of smarterware.org.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.080]   Hello.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.160]   It's good to see you once again,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.720]   Gina, the author of a fabulous book, which is now
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.760]   going to sell like hotcakes because everybody's using wave.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.640]   Everybody's in wave.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.120]   Complete God.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.960]   Everybody's in wave.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.460]   Come on.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.520]   She knew it all along.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.120]   She knew it.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920]   She said everybody will be--
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.760]   you know what we didn't acknowledge the fact
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.360]   that wave is one year old because they
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   announced it at Google I/O last year, didn't they?
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   Yeah, it is one year old and open to everyone.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.040]   And much better than it was a year ago.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.560]   True.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.760]   So try it again.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.200]   Also here, of course, the great Jeff Jarvis author
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.600]   of What Would Google Do, blogger at buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.080]   podcaster for The Guardian, and director
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.800]   of the Interactive Journalism Program
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   at the City University of New York,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.800]   where he is right now at their graduate school of journalism.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.360]   What is the headline behind you?
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   You told us once before.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.720]   I can't remember.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840]   This one is People Shot Down by Soldiers
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.120]   in the Streets of San Francisco.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.720]   Oh my goodness.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.160]   This was the earthquake.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   Yeah, this is the earthquake.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.800]   Hold on.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.120]   Wow.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.720]   Jeff's going to pull his--
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.000]   Let's see if we have a little closer.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.240]   He's got a framed newspaper.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.680]   Is that the call bulletin?
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.960]   This was the Oakland Tribune.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.800]   Oh, that's right, because the San Francisco papers couldn't
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   print.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.360]   Wow.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   An example of the old media.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.160]   Yes, we used to print things on dead trees.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760]   I saw a very kind of disturbing article.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.520]   It's really not related, although I guess it is peripherally,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.440]   that because fewer and fewer buyers are buying--
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.800]   I guess because newspapers are buying less ground wood pulp
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.480]   products, the companies that manufacture pulp wood
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.920]   are now selling more and more to booksellers or book publishers,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   book printers.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   And more and more books are not printed on acid free paper
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   anymore, but are printed on pulp wood, which will, of course,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.880]   disintegrate, turn yell and disintegrate over a period of decades.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.960]   Isn't that depressing?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.440]   Not if it's all digital.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.760]   Well, it's going to hasten the demise of the book.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.280]   I mean, I thought--
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   Literally.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   Yeah, literally.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.040]   I thought the book would survive,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.160]   because it is a kind of a form factor that
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.600]   has a certain aesthetic and a certain appeal.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.200]   And if anybody-- I mean, I have a library of books.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.840]   I love books.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.920]   I have books all over my walls.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   I've built in bookshelves.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.640]   And I love that.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.200]   Maybe I'm an antique.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.360]   But the thought that they made disintegrate--
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.640]   I think this article mentioned that something like one half
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.040]   of the New York Times bestseller list
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.480]   is printed on ground wood.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.200]   Wow.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   I'm surprised.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.560]   I'm surprised there aren't rules about that.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.880]   Who's going to make that rule?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   Well, this book must be on paper that's going to last long.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   Well, you know how a pog does this missing manual?
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.960]   He kind of in the beginning, he describes
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.280]   the high quality paper that he uses and the bindings.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.800]   So the book stays open on your desk while you tap the keys.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.880]   I would imagine that--
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   Well, let's go.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.200]   --it's going to be cut for out of the fact that they were written.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.720]   Yeah, it's more important now.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.560]   Pay attention.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.280]   I think physical books are more about being on a bookshelf
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.800]   and being sort of decoration, as well as things
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.720]   that we read, right?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.960]   But I have my books that I like to have on my walls
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.640]   and on my bookshelves.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.600]   And I have the books that I downloaded my Kindle
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.640]   just because I want to read them quick.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   And then they're kind of throw away.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.760]   It's not a big connection.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.320]   My next one, the need to underline.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   And Kindle just doesn't do it easily.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   Nobody does it easily.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.200]   Just to underline and write notes in the side,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.920]   I'm buying hard books.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.600]   Let's talk to a friend of mine who bought a used book on Amazon.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.480]   It's actually an interesting book, The History of the Vibrator.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.240]   And it said, an Amazon good excellent quality
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.000]   was top of the list.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.680]   And she had been underlined.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.560]   But I think there's something-- there's something--
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.040]   there's some value to that, isn't there?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.280]   There's some information that's been added there.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.480]   And I don't know if that's so bad.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   I love it that you can do that.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.360]   You can annotate.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.320]   You can marginalia.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.000]   Was it Euler's theorem?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   Whose theorem was it that he wrote in the margins
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   of his math book that this should be provable?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.040]   I have a proof.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.600]   And then there was never proven.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280]   And author's signatures, right?
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.080]   I remember being in a bookstore in the village of Manhattan
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.440]   and looking through finding the old copy of a book
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   from an author who I really liked
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.600]   and opening it up and finding that she had signed it.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.120]   Wow.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.080]   And I was like, this is so cool.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   And it was like $2.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   And that kind of thing, you can't sign a new book.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's for sure.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.440]   So let's talk about how badly AT&T sucks.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.200]   You say, Jeff, you call the cynical act.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.960]   Well, you know, when you think about it,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.720]   listen to John Stewart, right?
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.000]   The service sucks.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   There are two responses to that.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.040]   The proper response is to invest and make
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.760]   the service not suck.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.600]   The other response is to change your pricing
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.200]   so you make your customers use it less.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   That's what they did.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.840]   And the irony to me is I've told the story I think here
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.020]   before that is a guy named Tom Evslyn who ran AT&T World
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.120]   Net who took off the 1995--
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.080]   or put on the 1995 flat rate pricing
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.360]   and made the internet explode.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.840]   Right.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.440]   The irony is that it's AT&T that's
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.200]   putting the clock, the ticking clock, the, oh, I better get off
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.480]   clock back on connectivity just as mobile explodes.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.720]   It just shows what terrible managers they are.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.200]   And yeah, people come in and say, oh, it's
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.480]   so long.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.560]   It's flying to man drivers.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.520]   And this and that.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.440]   But at some point, if you're selling me a service,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.960]   I'm afraid to use.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.960]   So for those of you who haven't been paying as we
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.520]   have strict attention to all the latest tech news every moment,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.320]   of course, because we watch that fabulous Tom Merritt
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.760]   and Becky Worley on Tech News today, every weekday,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.640]   at 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern on Twit Live.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.880]   And you said you weren't going to watch.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.680]   I heard you put that show.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.000]   You're an astronaut.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.160]   But those of you who weren't listening yesterday, AT&T
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.760]   shocked every iPad owner.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   I gave my 80-year-old father-in-law an iPad last week.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   And he sent me an email this week.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   He said, because I said, get the 250 megs.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.600]   You probably won't use them.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.880]   She said, I use it up.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.960]   So he had to subscribe to the $30 gig--
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.160]   I mean, $30 unlimited AT&T plan.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   Well, it's a good thing he did because Monday AT&T's announced
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   we're discontinuing it.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.600]   They're going to charge $25 for two gigabytes of data.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.360]   And then an additional $10 for every additional gigabyte
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   you download.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.280]   And now you're grandfathered in if you get
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.960]   you're unlimited by Monday.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.120]   But that, to me, that seems like a cynical--
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   you're right, cynical act.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.680]   When does Apple drop AT&T?
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.920]   What did Jobs have to say about that last week?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   He did?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.560]   He bit his lip.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.360]   Is that the signal?
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.320]   And he touches the ear.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.120]   And then he--
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   So--
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.620]   like this.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.600]   And that means--
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.000]   Walt Mossberg asked Steve Jobs at the D8 conference.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.360]   When's Verizon going to get the iPhone?
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.200]   Steve doesn't answer.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.240]   He goes, we're going to try for--
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.880]   I was trying to hold back.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.560]   I'm going to read the tea leaves, Gina.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.640]   It's my opinion that he was going--
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.120]   he wanted to say, watch Monday.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.400]   And this-- it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.560]   Now, maybe I'm nuts.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.640]   But the AT&T's plan changes Monday.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.320]   So the question is, who was it blinked?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.480]   Was it AT&T that said we can't afford to do this?
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.680]   We're going to have to charge you.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.240]   And then Apple said, OK, fine.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.200]   We're going Verizon.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.720]   Or was it the other way around that AT&T found out?
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.880]   And said, OK, well, so much for that unlimited plan
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.840]   that you begged us for.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.920]   Which do you think, Gina?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.800]   I think Apple's in the driver's seat there.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   I think.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.520]   I don't know.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.960]   I don't know.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.360]   What do you guys think?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.080]   Well, I put it in front of this way.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.560]   I think that when Apple picked AT&T, Apple sniffed the shark.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.060]   Right?
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.640]   Because why did they pick them so they could have control,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.400]   not to get us better service?
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.400]   Yeah, we got unlimited.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.720]   We only got it for a while.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.840]   You know, I think it's more of control freakishness.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.360]   I don't know.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.880]   And we're left with terrible choices now.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.600]   You know, Verizon's no better.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.800]   Verizon's had caps on forever.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.880]   You have Verizon's 5 gigabytes.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.440]   And you really can't buy more.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.480]   Right?
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.520]   And then Sprint is--
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   I'm eager to hear Gina's review of the Evo
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.720]   because Sprint is unlimited.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.120]   But I can't use it in Europe.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.960]   And T-Mobile has it unlimited today,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.640]   but I can't use it in America.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.280]   T-Mobile gives you free-- right now,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.720]   gives you free tethering on an Nexus One with Froyo.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.680]   That's the other AT&T's going to charge $20 for tethering.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.160]   Right.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.240]   And Sprint's going to charge $30.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.560]   Yeah, $30.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.600]   Although--
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.200]   That's still half what they charge for a MIFI.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.720]   I mean, so on the Evo, Sprint has the capability
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.960]   to turn on the hotspot.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   So the Evo that we got at I/O has unlimited data, right?
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.280]   So you can use it as a hotspot.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.360]   But if you don't have the--
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.000]   pay that extra $30, right, in theory,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   you can't use it as a hotspot.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   But you can still tether using PDA net or any other way
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.200]   that you could-- I mean, I was tethering before with Android
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   2.1, just using PDA net and connecting it
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.240]   with a USB cable to my--
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.160]   You know, how do they know?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.560]   Do they know where the traffic's coming from?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.280]   That's my question.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.120]   I mean, Android could report back.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.920]   Well, Android could report back, right?
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.800]   It could say tethering's on.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.640]   I guess so.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   You got a fire up wire shark, Gina.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.640]   Yeah, we should.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.520]   No, I mean, but how?
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.400]   I mean, it's not like-- I mean, HTTP traffic right
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.560]   is going to send the agent--
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.800]   The traffic will look the same.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.120]   Yeah, the traffic's going to look the same.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.400]   Android would have to say would have to signal to the carrier--
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.520]   They've turned on tethering.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.680]   Well, couldn't you tell because you'd
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.960]   see different browser types and it's like that come through.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.560]   Ah, that's true too.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.320]   Yeah, but--
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.480]   But Steve, Steve, you'd have to do deep packet inspection.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.840]   You'd have to sniff the packets, which is kind of verboten.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.360]   So we're saying that Apple said it
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   was going to make the iPhone available on Verizon
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.160]   in response to that AT&C.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.440]   You said, fine, OK, we're going to start charging for this.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   One of the others, somebody blinked.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.320]   Somebody said, OK, but the upshot for the consumer
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.960]   is it's got to be.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.640]   Steve's going to take the stage 10 AM June 7th, Monday.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   Worldwide Developers Conference, quote,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.040]   you won't be disappointed.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   What's he going to say of Verizon iPad?
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.040]   Is he going to say Verizon iPhone?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.760]   Is he going to say both?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.160]   He's got to do so.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.960]   He's got to be-- look at 100,000 Android phones a day now.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.920]   You know, Apple trumpeted 2 million iPads in two months.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.840]   100,000 a day is 3 million Android phones a month.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.400]   It's three times that.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.880]   And did you hear what he said about Schmidt last night?
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.080]   No.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.560]   I didn't see this in the video.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.320]   I was reading Ina Freed's live blog.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.520]   I guess they-- Walt Mossberg had asked jobs
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.400]   like what happened with Schmidt.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.240]   And Jobs said something like, they
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.720]   decided to compete with us.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.320]   You know, we didn't go into search.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.920]   So something like that.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.480]   So it was like--
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.120]   That's his story.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.920]   Steve was the kinder, gentler.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.280]   Steve, hey, I wasn't going after Adobe.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   We just made a technical decision.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.360]   And then they attacked me so I had to get him.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.560]   But I think that that comment says that Jobs is paying--
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.280]   I think he's concerned about the Android thing.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.000]   I think that he's like, OK, we're on.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.480]   Game round.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.040]   He's got any chance he'd open it up to all carriers?
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.440]   He could.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.240]   That's interesting.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.400]   That's an interesting play.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.080]   If you're going to fight Google, then screw it, man.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.120]   You get your iPhones everywhere.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.880]   You know, why wouldn't he?
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.360]   Because if you give up the exclusive, then--
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.120]   There's no benefit to him.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.480]   Verizon's not going to say no, just because everybody else
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.040]   is selling it, they want the iPhone, I'm sure.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.640]   Don't they?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.200]   I mean, anybody would want the iPhone.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.600]   Look how the iPhone sells.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.240]   Why not?
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.520]   Even if you're selling Android phones,
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.440]   give your customers every choice possible.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.480]   Now, by the way, it ain't just phones we're talking.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.240]   Android tablets, there are--
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.920]   Steve gives and told me 45.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.800]   Count them.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.440]   Tablets being announced this week at the Computex in Taiwan
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.840]   running Android.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.200]   So Gina, you're going to get your wish.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.880]   I'm excited.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.120]   I'm really excited to try out an Android tablet.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.960]   This is going to be-- where is this conference?
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.640]   Computex is the big PC manufacturers conference in Taiwan.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.560]   Oh, it's in Taiwan.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.640]   And so it's all the time--
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   well, Acer, ASUS--
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.560]   yeah, it's all the time when he's manufacturers.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.800]   And lots of different designs we're seeing--
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.720]   kind of funky, interesting hardware,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.600]   but SD card slots, USB connectors, cameras, all the things
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   Apple isn't putting on there.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.920]   I have to say, I've come around it.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   When you first said, oh, I can't wait for an Android tablet.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.800]   I was saying, oh, but no, this iPad, it's perfect.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.720]   It's perfect.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.600]   But I think you're right.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.800]   I think an Android tablet could be just as good, couldn't it?
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.360]   I think so.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.480]   And wire-free.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.120]   No wires, which is something else that Jobs talked about last night,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.320]   right?
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.800]   The fact that you have to connect your iPad here.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.720]   Yeah, that's the deal with that.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.160]   Did he explain that?
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.120]   He said, we need to get better at that.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.640]   I feel like it was-- he was really--
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   I was pretty-- no, again, I didn't see this video.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.400]   I just read the text.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.920]   I'm not sure how it delivered it.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.120]   But I mean, the fact that--
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.960]   I mean, one could argue that Apple doesn't really
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.720]   doesn't get the cloud nearly as well as Google does.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.160]   And I think that the fact that you have to connect your iPad
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.480]   to your back with the board is a really good indicator of that.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.400]   So I think that the fact that Jobs said, yeah, right now,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.360]   there's a wire involved to sync your data.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.720]   We need to get better at that.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.120]   Is it still true that you can't use an iPad unless you
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.960]   have a computer?
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.640]   Well, when you turn it on, it says, hook me up.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.320]   But people tell me there's no reason you couldn't do that
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.120]   at the Apple store.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.240]   They would hook it up for you.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.200]   You would have to put an account in.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.600]   And then you can get music and applications without connecting.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680]   It'll never back up.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.880]   But you kind of be SOL.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.920]   You have to take it back to the store if anything happened to it.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.640]   But you don't have-- that's the thing Apple didn't have to do that.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.160]   Whereas Android tablets, like Android phones,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.640]   will back up to the cloud.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.160]   Right.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.240]   The cloud, yeah.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.720]   Right.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.200]   And you sign in and all your data is there instantly.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.120]   Tell me this, though.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   I think there's a difference, is there not?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.800]   If I get official Android and I get access
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.880]   to the marketplace, if I get open source Android,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.840]   I don't get access to the marketplace, right?
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   What?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.280]   Is that true?
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.920]   Somebody told me that was the case for--
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.600]   and this is fourth hand.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.960]   It would just be a concern that if you didn't have a billion
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   relationship through the structure, a manufacturer
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.160]   can throw on open source Android onto the device,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.920]   but that you lose some things.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.240]   And I'm not sure exactly what.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.400]   Well, if you have a Google account, you have a Google check out.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.920]   Right.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.600]   So that-- OK, good.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.560]   That makes me feel better.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.640]   Well, so there's-- OK.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.640]   So there's the Android operating system, much of which
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.520]   is open source, right?
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.920]   And that's the operating system.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.800]   And that's open source.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.320]   And then there are some apps on top of it
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.240]   which are closed source.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.600]   Like, for example, the Gmail native client.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   That's a closed source application, right?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.600]   So this is why Syanna just got into all that trouble when
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.360]   he was distributing the other wrong way.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   He can't distribute the G to the stuff.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   Right.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.200]   Because he can't distribute these closed source apps.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.240]   So I'm not sure if the market app is closed source.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.920]   That's a possibility.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.360]   Well, also a Gmail.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.400]   So the problem is if you get a tablet with Android,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   I'm not sure that's a sufficient answer.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.280]   I don't know.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.960]   But I think it's worth looking into as these things come out.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.680]   Yeah, I mean, this can be interesting.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.360]   If companies are creating custom builds of Android
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   to install on their software, on their hardware,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.360]   that's like completely--
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.600]   I want to say Chromium, but that's
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.520]   the open source layer of Chrome.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.160]   Forgetting what the Android project is, it's like a--
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.080]   it's some acronym that basically says,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.680]   this is the open source version of Android.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.040]   So it's like Darwin and OS 10, Chromium and Chrome.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.560]   Exactly.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.080]   So you're going to have a problem with fragmentation.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.600]   You're not going to get Froyo.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.520]   You're going to have Forking.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.040]   Right.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.560]   Right.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.060]   Well, right.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.840]   Yeah, there's Forking.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.720]   That's part of--
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   That's open source.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   Welcome open source.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   Right.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   Welcome open source.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.880]   You know?
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   Work.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.080]   You know, you and I both--
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.320]   Gina now are using a Sprint Evo.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.960]   You got yours at Google I/O and Sprint sent me a loaner.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.320]   Yes, I'm going to send it back.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.680]   But I think I'm going to buy it.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.840]   But it has the HTC sense on top of it,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.280]   including the HTC apps, which are like the Google Apps
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.320]   proprietary.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.280]   I like the Mail app better, for instance.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.880]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.040]   So I don't use the Mail app because I use the Gmail app.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.520]   But their browser is a little better.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.000]   I think it's the same.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.520]   Is it better?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.360]   I still envision using client.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.560]   If you look at a little named internet,
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.640]   it's not named browser.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.200]   And it had Pinch to Zoom.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.520]   But the regular browser has it.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.680]   It has a couple of features.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.320]   It does a couple of things a little differently
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.360]   than the Android browser.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.760]   So I think that it is a different browser.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   OK.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   I didn't really pay any attention to it.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.800]   I think I could be wrong about that.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.000]   Leo, you've also-- have you used the incredible?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.200]   I have only played with it.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.400]   I haven't used it extensively.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.880]   That's the hot debate going in.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.400]   It's also a sense.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.200]   And as I give up on AT&T and switch fully to Android.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.840]   And T-Mobile, God bless him.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.520]   I like the plan, but the service doesn't
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.760]   work for where I live.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   So I've got to decide between the Evo and the incredible.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.920]   I like the big screen on the Evo.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.720]   Really, it's a choice between Verizon and Sprint,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   I think, at bottom.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.680]   I think the differences are small enough that it's really
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.440]   more about the carrier.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   However, this--
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.360]   One of them has unlimited data.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.240]   For now, Sprint's cheaper.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.080]   Sprint's going to be cheaper.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.040]   Sprint's been doing it for a long time.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.760]   I like Sprint.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.480]   And I think because they're an underdog,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.600]   they can't change quite as easily.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.840]   This is the email, the HTC Sense email.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.200]   It has a couple of features I like.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.880]   It has threaded conversations, just like Gmail.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.360]   Oh, nice.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.480]   But it also has a VIP group.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.720]   You can add context to the VIP group.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.560]   If they're in that, they get a special mailbox.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.680]   Now, of course, I could do this with rules.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.440]   But they get a special mailbox, which means I no longer
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.400]   miss emails from my mom.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.600]   Oh, that's really nice.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.240]   It's really, really nice.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.480]   But now, Gino, another question is, are you an I in that list?
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   Yes, you are.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.600]   That is the question you are.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.080]   You are on that list.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.640]   No, you are on that list.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.760]   Everybody I work with is on that list.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.520]   So these are the emails I want to see.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   So it's little things like that.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.560]   I think are pretty nice.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.760]   It doesn't have a unified inbox, which is a little frustrating.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.960]   But I can always go to the Google app for that.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.560]   Because you still get the Google Apps.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.560]   These widgets, though, I really like some of these widgets.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.440]   Yeah, I like the widgets.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.120]   And there's Flickr integration, too.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.800]   And yeah, I like that widget there.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.560]   The pictures of your--
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.320]   The favorites widget.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.080]   Isn't that fantastic?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.720]   Now, how's the battery life that everybody's
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.560]   been screaming about?
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   This is a bigger battery.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.680]   It's about, I think, 12% bigger than the Nexus one.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.360]   But for people's sake, it just dies.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.120]   Well, I think with 4G, it might.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.800]   4G is a real--
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.560]   Yeah, with 4G, I need to toggle that off.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.000]   Well, most likely you don't have it anyway, right?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.440]   Right.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.360]   So I do the same thing.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.880]   In fact, I'll talk a little bit if you
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.760]   want about battery conservation techniques for Android.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.240]   Because I'd love to talk with you about what you do, Gina.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.600]   But I've really done a lot of research on this,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.160]   trying to find the best battery life.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.360]   This seems to have about the same as the Nexus one,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.680]   maybe slightly better when I do the same things.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.760]   It's certainly-- all smartphones now,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.240]   you have to nurse through the day.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.280]   You can't get them-- they're not going to go all day
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   if you're not careful, right?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.480]   It's true.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.200]   This is the messaging app, which I really--
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.960]   widget, I should say, which I really like.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.360]   A better music widget, much more usable.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.640]   Yeah, the music widget is real nice.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.120]   It's got cover flow, which even the iPhone lacks.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.360]   Or maybe it's the iPad, though, lacks it.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.040]   Of course, none of my album art survived the transition.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.880]   But at least if I had cover flow, I could--
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.520]   You had it.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.640]   So I don't know.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.920]   I like the Evo screen.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.960]   I think for us old guys, Jeff, the legend.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.280]   It's the same resolution.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   It's just a bigger screen.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.440]   It's a bigger screen, yeah.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.680]   So it's more legible.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.960]   The large text edition of Android.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.040]   That screen is just on the edge of being too big.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.000]   I'm perfect.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   But if it was any bigger, I would feel like, OK,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.080]   we're now in tablet land.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.600]   Yes.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.240]   So you're not--
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.880]   You could just fit it in your breast pocket.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.440]   I mean, they really kind of pushed it right to the edge there.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.400]   But that's what they should do.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.600]   The dull thing that's coming out,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.320]   I can't forget the new name.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.120]   That one's huge.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.080]   You don't want to look--
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.400]   I mean, you've got to consider the dork effect of holding
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.600]   something too big to your head.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.040]   Too big or too small.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.520]   I used to work with a guy, David Borman.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.120]   He's now the bureau chief at CNN Washington.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.640]   And this was in '94.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.280]   And it was a real status object to have the world's biggest
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.640]   watch and the world's smallest cell phone.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.760]   And he had a Sony cell phone that was this big
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.120]   and had a little thing that came up.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.640]   And he was a large man.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.040]   And he looked like such a nitwit.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.800]   Holding this thing to his ear, and I
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.640]   noticed he doesn't carry that anymore.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.800]   The Android open source project is AOSP, the real Riley
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.680]   thousands, Twitter.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.960]   So ASAP.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   ASAP.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.880]   I knew it was something like that.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.080]   AOSP.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.680]   AOSP or O.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.200]   OOSP.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.680]   They missed a dead--
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.080]   Android open source project.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.000]   They should have made it the Android source open project.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.480]   AOSP.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.000]   Then they'd have--
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.680]   It's easier to say.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.960]   Then they'd have an acronym.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.000]   Then they got an acronym.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.120]   So we're all mad at AT&T, AT&T sucks.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.320]   We think reading the tea leaves, which
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.560]   is a popular thing to do with Apple shows.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.920]   But this is a Google show.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.240]   We can read tea leaves, too.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.640]   That that means an announcement on Monday from Apple.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.600]   What do you think about this?
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.120]   Google says no to Windows.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.000]   Now I know about this because Colleen Kelly, our engineer,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.600]   just went to Google.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.240]   And she said to me-- and I didn't say anything
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.920]   because I didn't know if it was secret--
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.960]   they aren't offering me a Windows machine.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.800]   I said, what?
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.520]   Because she's a Windows lover.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.120]   No, I can only use Linux or Mac.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.400]   Now it comes out.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.960]   That's the new policy.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.600]   See, I just immediately thought that whole report.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.720]   I was like, there's no way.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.400]   There's no way that they're banning Windows.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.240]   So now I think there's a big difference between strongly
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.200]   encouraging your employees to use a certain setup
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.520]   and absolutely banning an operating system.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.600]   So I mean, if a Google employee said,
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.120]   I need a Windows machine in order
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.200]   to do this kind of development or do this kind of testing,
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.080]   they're really going to say no.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.920]   Is this a sound?
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.000]   Yes, apparently they are.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.480]   They're basement.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.440]   Apparently you have to go-- well, now again, you're right.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.000]   I don't know if this is official or not.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.240]   But what I read is you have to go to a committee.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.720]   That seems--
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.680]   I have to defend my use of Windows.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.920]   It does seem weird.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.000]   It seems weird.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.920]   It seems like a really kind of uncharacteristically
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.960]   bad move, I think.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   I mean, nine out of 10 of the personal computers
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.640]   in the world, right?
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.480]   Run Windows.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.120]   Do you think when you're creating a product,
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.560]   even if it's a web app, I mean--
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.400]   It would be a mistake.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:08.840]   You're right.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.200]   It would be a huge mistake.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.560]   You got to eat your own dog food.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.000]   You do.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.080]   You have to eat your own dog food.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.280]   And you have to run IE.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.040]   But the world runs IE, right?
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.760]   I mean, whether or not that that's a good thing.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.640]   I'm not saying that's a good thing at all.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.960]   But that's kind of the reality.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.400]   And so you've got to experience your product the way most
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   of your users are.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.760]   So that freaks me out a little bit.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.200]   I mean, most of the world is not using Mac or Linux.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.280]   I mean, the Linux desktop thing is particularly like,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.320]   really?
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.840]   Like the sales and marketing people at Google
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.360]   are using Linux, I assume, with their go for the Macs.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.200]   Front Office has to use Windows.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.120]   You know me.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.840]   I'm a Mac fan.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.680]   Some would say a boy.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.800]   But even here at the front office,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.680]   they're using Windows because they all use QuickBooks.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.600]   Well, maybe it depends on the department.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.920]   If the argument was that it helped provide the vulnerability,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.440]   your basic sales person doesn't have access to anything
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.320]   that's going to make a company vulnerable.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.200]   But your programmer is, no?
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.240]   Yeah, I mean, the whole vulnerability thing
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.520]   is like, oh, the story that ran said something like,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.160]   oh, because of the China hack thing.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.920]   But it's like they're not banning Flash, right?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.440]   I mean, that wasn't just a Windows thing.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.960]   It's a feature.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.760]   It's a feature.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.080]   Yeah, he did.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.200]   It seemed odd to me.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.920]   But now that you say the Colleen is,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.240]   as a new Google employee, was kind of given the choice.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.080]   Thanks, I'm Mac.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.240]   She was shocked.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   I'm surprised.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   So this confirms at least that new employees--
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.720]   because when you go to a company, you get a computer--
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.480]   are being offered two, not three, but two choices.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.360]   Now, she's going into engineering.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.920]   She, her job as video streaming engineer.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.400]   So it might make sense that an engineer for their day-to-day
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.800]   computer would be given one kind.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.360]   And it doesn't say that she can't run Windows in emulation.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.720]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.440]   OK.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.160]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.440]   We didn't get into great detail.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.200]   I didn't want to pry.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   But I thought that was really surprising.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.120]   And then when I see these news stories coming out,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.360]   maybe it's true.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:10.520]   And not to mention that there are plenty of security--
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   I hate to say this--
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.520]   Of course there are.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   --of security holes.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.720]   Back and went analytics.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   Absolutely.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.600]   Absolutely.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   It's not-- boy, Microsoft was pissed.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.760]   Did you see the Microsoft blog where they said, no, well,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.720]   actually, we're more secure.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.360]   I love it when they do this.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.560]   We're the most secure operating system in the world.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.240]   Everyone knows that.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.280]   Of course they did.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.800]   Of course they are.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.920]   Of course you are, baby.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.640]   I'm sorry we hurt your feet.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.120]   Oh, girl, cowboy.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.960]   Yes, you're very secure.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.040]   It's the funniest blog post I ever read.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   It's like, what world are you living in?
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.800]   We're the most secure operating system in the world.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.760]   Everybody agrees.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   I shouldn't make fun of that.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.360]   It is so much fun.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.240]   You deal with that a lot in the newspaper industry.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.880]   You know all about that.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.360]   You know, it does strike me that the karma is getting really
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.040]   nasty on the West Coast.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.600]   Yeah, we're angry.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.240]   You know why?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.720]   California is bankrupt.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   Is that what it is?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.240]   We're pissed.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.560]   The Apple versus Microsoft versus Google versus everybody.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.160]   Something in the water, I know.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.560]   And Microsoft's in Washington State,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.520]   and they're just hands off.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.920]   They're like, no, God, you guys are crazy down there
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.240]   in the Silicon Valley.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.000]   You're nuts.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.920]   What is going on?
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.120]   You're right.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.720]   And they're-- you know, the campus-- now,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.600]   do you have any-- is there any credence in this idea
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.960]   that Apple planted a fifth column inside of Microsoft?
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.280]   And the reason that Microsoft's consumer division has gone--
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.040]   this is Rob Enderly said this, I think.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.960]   The reason that Microsoft's consumer division has gone so bad
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.680]   is that Robby Bach really was a secret Apple plant?
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.160]   That can't do that.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.000]   Talk about smoking something.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.920]   There'd be laws against that, I think.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.680]   I don't think that Apple would plant a fifth columnist
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.160]   inside of Microsoft.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.920]   I love the gods, so very V.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.440]   He's so very V. All right, let's take a break.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:08.800]   Come back.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.040]   We're talking, of course, about Google and the cloud,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.960]   and everything going on in the cloud
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.120]   verse with the great Gina Crapani and Jeff Jarvis.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.600]   We will have more for you in a moment,
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.320]   but I do want to mention our cloud friends--
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.800]   Citrix has been cloud forever.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.840]   Remote access is their bread and butter,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   and has been for more than a decade.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.040]   In fact, I started using GoToAssist,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.560]   their remote assistance product.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.160]   It was about six years, seven years ago on the screen savers.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   The latest GoToAssist Express is so slick, so fast, so good.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.800]   You could try it free for 30 days right now
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.040]   if you go to go to assist.com/twig.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.120]   This takes support and puts it in the cloud,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   so you don't have to walk down the hall to your users.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.480]   You don't have to travel around to your users.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.960]   You don't have to even be on the phone explaining stuff to them.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.400]   You just say, you got a problem?
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.760]   I did this with my mom.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   She was having trouble.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.160]   I think Quicken was storing.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.880]   She said, where's my Quicken data?
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.600]   I said, Mom, I'm on chat.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.640]   Well, I'm a Skype with her, actually.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.080]   And I said, in Skype chat, I sent her the link to go to assist.com
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.240]   with-- and had this special ID built in there.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.600]   She clicked it.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.000]   Literally, 30 seconds later.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.080]   It's a quick download.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.520]   I'm fixing the problem and saying, oh, here it is, Mom.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.800]   It's right here.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.880]   This is so great.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.760]   If you're in professional remote support--
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.400]   or support, you need remote access.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.360]   And this is the one to get go to assist.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.680]   Express.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.200]   It has all sorts of nice features.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.040]   Eight sessions at once.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.440]   Unattended sessions, if you wish.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.680]   Your clients don't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.920]   It's so quick to install it.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.840]   Boom, you're fixing it right away.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.880]   It'll tell you what operating system, what security
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.640]   software, all the software running in the background.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.760]   It works on PCs and Macs.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.160]   So I'm on Windows supporting Mom on a Mac.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.120]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.520]   It's the modern world coming to support.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.600]   Try it right now, by the way.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   128-bit SS on-cription, of course.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.400]   Free customer service 24/7, of course.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:11.600]   Go to go to assist.com/twig, T-W-I-G,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.320]   and you get 30 days free.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.440]   There are day passes for the casual support enthusiast,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.800]   like the family support person.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.360]   But I think the monthly is going to be the way to go
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.640]   if you're in the business of support.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.000]   Go to assist.com/twig, we thank them,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.080]   for their support of this week in Google.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.840]   I loved your post, Jeff, on the FTC report
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.880]   on how to save journalism.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.960]   And at the FTC and the FCC, both have these projects going on.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.400]   And I testified at Hearings for both.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.000]   Well, they didn't listen to you, obviously.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.600]   Oh, no, no.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.920]   At the FCC, I had the joy of beginning my testimony
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.280]   with the word "baba buoy."
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.200]   No!
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.640]   Yeah, I did.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.040]   No!
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.640]   What did they do?
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.080]   Did they even know what you were doing?
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.000]   Oh, that's knickered.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.280]   They snickered.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   Oh, that's good.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.400]   I think it's a younger, hipper crowd now.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.960]   Because I was making a point about why they should butt out.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.920]   Look what they did to our survey.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.320]   Anyway, the FTC has another one of these Hearings
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.880]   or workshops coming up on June 15.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.440]   So they released a 35-page discussion document,
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.160]   discussion draft.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.080]   And it was shocking to me in a few ways.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.440]   What it really does is it equates the future of journalism
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.280]   with newspapers.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.400]   And it tries to then save newspapers as they exist,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.680]   which, of course, is not possible,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.840]   because they have to change.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.400]   The FTC did not try to align itself
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.760]   with the entrepreneurs and innovators and disruptors
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.400]   who were going to create the future.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.720]   Evidence of that in the entire 35 pages,
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.440]   they mentioned the word blog but once.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.600]   And that was only to make a parenthetical reference
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.440]   to buying ads on soccer blogs.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.680]   That's so freaking clueless, I can't believe it.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.360]   That's me, the saying, the definition of bloggers.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.280]   Bloggers, how horrible.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   They're all in their jammies.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.520]   You see, I think we're back at this now.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.080]   It's back into a world with control
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.040]   versus the uncontrolled.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.720]   Institutional versus the--
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.640]   I guess it shouldn't surprise me that this
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.840]   is how government thinks.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.800]   But, you know, administration wants change and you go,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.760]   what I really is is that it develops the--
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.600]   it's certainly in the wagons run each other.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.080]   It's the old institutions helping each other.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.400]   It's not right or left here.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.520]   One of my commenters in the blog wonderfully called it,
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.040]   not the conservatives or liberals, but the preservatives.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.600]   I love it.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.920]   I love it.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.040]   The document didn't talk about it.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.480]   It's not the FCC, it's BHT.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.000]   I got it.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.040]   The document talked about technology only at the very end
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.320]   where they suggested things like looking
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.480]   at new note-taking technologies.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.800]   It made a lot of sense of suggestions
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.760]   about extending copyright and limiting fair use,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.640]   which would be awful.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.920]   They actually had the idea in their proprietary facts, which
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.560]   is worse than the patent office.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.440]   They looked at subsidy in various ways,
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.560]   all of which are politically untenable.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.240]   But they looked at subsidies in terms of--
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.680]   They want to tax-- well, no, this isn't a plan, though.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.840]   They're not really going to do that.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.880]   Somebody suggested, right?
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.600]   No, this is going to happen.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.320]   But tax us on what?
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.120]   Technology?
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.520]   So we're electronics devices.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.880]   So I just be nasty, call it the iPad tax 5%.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.360]   And then that money goes to support--
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:28.840]   It's going to be a million dollars.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.000]   Goes to keep Rupert Murdoch's business going,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.360]   just in case you were worried about it.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.120]   I'm down for that.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.040]   It's absurd, absurd document.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.960]   And it's just-- it's the right wing that's coming out,
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.760]   smashing it, too.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   But I think that both sides should be just appalled at this,
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.840]   that it's not about protecting the past.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.120]   And so what we see here, I think,
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.320]   is a larger question for us and government,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   is that innovators and entrepreneurs and technologists
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.480]   have no lobbying muscle in Washington.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.760]   And to a great extent, we don't give a damn.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.640]   But there are issues that affect us and thus
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.800]   the future of the country.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.480]   And I think we're going to find ourselves a week
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.200]   as you look at Google itself that had no lobbying in Washington,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   messed up for a long time, finally did.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.320]   We, as technologists, don't have it.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.960]   It's a discussion that we've had,
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.680]   Gina, many times, that as you say,
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.800]   that the hacks just go around.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.640]   The hackers just go around.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.200]   But I think this is going to be an issue for us,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.560]   is because at some point, something dangerous could be done.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.120]   Copyright could be extended for newspapers.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.040]   Fair use could be brought back in.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.720]   Bad things could happen out of Washington.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.760]   It's scary.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.400]   Now to top this off, Danny Sullivan, poor Danny Sullivan,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.120]   was the guy who came up with the story.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.560]   Was it on search engine land, or was it on his own personal
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.080]   blog?
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   I presume my search engine--
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   I think it was search engine land.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.240]   --about this woman who is suing.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.040]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.000]   There's two stories here.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.240]   There's the story and there's the meta story.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   And the meta story ties to what you're saying,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.440]   because Danny, who is a great blogger, really good blogger,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.280]   broke this story.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.480]   But all the mainstream media picked up the story.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   And didn't credit him.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.400]   And didn't credit him, at least.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.440]   And even stole his screenshot.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.000]   Yeah, that's why--
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.400]   That's why he says he knew it hasn't.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.880]   He says, the Daily Mail has the story,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.680]   and he knows that it was his story,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.560]   because they're using the screenshot he made without attribution.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560]   Somebody else did the same thing.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.680]   And then the secondary layer is people will then
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.400]   quote the Daily Mail, not Danny.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.600]   Yeah, well, of course.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.100]   Right.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.840]   And you know, last night they asked--
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   I think Kara asked Jobs, you know,
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.120]   what about saving journalism?
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.600]   And he said, well, you know, we don't want to descend
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.000]   into a nation of bloggers.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Oh!
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.520]   And that was my quote, lest we descend
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.320]   into a nation of bloggers, because bloggers don't actually
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.800]   break news.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.440]   It's like, actually, yeah, no, Danny broke this story.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.200]   He got totally ripped off.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   They used to--
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.840]   There's Trump to tell him.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.520]   --like, this is legitimate journalism.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.720]   I mean, he saw a legal brief that no one else spotted, right?
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.240]   Or a friend of his spotted it for him.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.000]   And he wrote up the story.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.920]   So it's infuriating.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.400]   Jobs had me in the--
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.080]   I want to really hate him, but I don't.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.160]   I respect him very much.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.880]   And he had me in the palm of his hand.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.600]   He does-- I don't know.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.880]   It's like these Jedi mind tricks.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.400]   He presents very well.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.200]   But when he says things like that,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.000]   we don't want to descend into a nation of bloggers.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.080]   I just want to kick them in the shins.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.440]   Well, hey, it could be worse.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.880]   It could be a nation of podcasters.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.080]   Think what that might be like.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.240]   Well, that would be bad.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   Oh, shut up.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.520]   It's such a visionary if you for him to be so--
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.440]   It doesn't surprise me because he was very dismissive of podcasts
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.200]   early on, too.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.880]   He thought very little of them.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.680]   Although you got to--
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.760]   I think this goes back to the control versus the uncontrolled.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.280]   Right.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.240]   That's why jobs and publishers are embracing each other
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.840]   because they want a controlled world.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.040]   But Battelle wrote a great post about just that, Gina,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   saying that he respects the hell out of them.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.560]   But there were like three times in the talk
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.640]   he just wanted to strangle them.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   And Battelle's line was, Steve, we started as a nation of bloggers.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.960]   Oh, good point.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.520]   The pamphletiers.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.240]   I like that point.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.840]   Very good point.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.880]   That's all we are.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.040]   So you were going to mention what the understory was
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.840]   to that meta story?
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.240]   Well, it's kind of-- the understory
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.480]   isn't that-- it's a fun-- one of those, you know,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   ha ha, what a funny story.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.040]   The meta story is really more interesting.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   But the story is that a woman--
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.000]   and thank you, Danny Sullivan, search engine land,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.640]   who broke this story.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.240]   Because you know what?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.680]   We do the same thing.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.800]   I try to remember to attribute stuff.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.280]   But I often forget to say where the story came from and stuff.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.360]   So I feel like I do that, too.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:36.800]   You know what?
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.960]   Part of this, Jeff, isn't it just the link economy?
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.920]   Everybody just kind of-- yeah, that's part of it.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.960]   I think it's part of what I have to teach here at journalism
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.240]   school, that the provenance matters in a few ways, right?
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.880]   It matters so that the reader can know where the source really
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.800]   goes to.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.840]   A, B, it matters about supporting the journalism
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.360]   of the source.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.000]   Because if he or she gets the links monetizes,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.680]   then the links are money.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.920]   Well, and I have a little turn.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.280]   Because I'll read about something, let's say, on Hacker News.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.640]   So I'm tempted to give the link to Hacker News,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.440]   because that's where I read about it.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.840]   But what I usually do-- and you tell me
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.200]   what I should do, Professor Jarvis-- I usually trace it down
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.000]   to where as far down as I can go.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.680]   And if it's a Huffington Post just linking to somebody else,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.040]   I'm not going to give Huff-Poe the link.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.560]   I do--
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.520]   I prefer that.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.040]   Go to the source.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.360]   I think that's the ethical thing to do.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.440]   Go to the source.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.920]   And it supports journalism with a source.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.200]   But I think in line with that, we
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.520]   have a journalist file at that as Danny demonstrates,
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.760]   right and left.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.960]   So we complain-- we're not going to complain about parasites.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.280]   Well, they're parasites.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.520]   And one of the funny things back to the FTC for one boring
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.000]   second is when they talk about changing fair use,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.200]   they recognize that every damn journalist uses fair use.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   TV is made to rip and read fair use.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.880]   You bet.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.200]   And if they restricted fair use,
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.880]   they would probably cut off much of the journalism business.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.560]   You use a phrase that I doubt anybody under the age of 40
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.800]   knows these days, rip and read.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.520]   But that's how I became--
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:58.920]   That's how--
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.640]   Make me feel old, Leo.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.560]   Thank you.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.840]   But that's how I started, too.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.000]   Rip and read.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Gina, do you know what Rip and read is?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.600]   I don't.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.640]   Of course she doesn't, Jeff.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.520]   Of course she doesn't.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.560]   Because Rip and read goes back to the days
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.640]   when you would get-- as a newsman or a reporter
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.720]   in the news station, you would get your news
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.600]   from this thing called a teletype.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.520]   They put them in a separate room because there were four
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.160]   of them-- UPI, AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg or whoever.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.120]   And they'd be going, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.960]   Spinning it out on old--
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.880]   talk about ground wood.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.240]   This stuff still had pieces of wood in the paper.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.120]   Rolls of wood--
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   a paper rather than made out of wood.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.000]   And you'd go in with a ruler and a number four pencil,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   the softest pencil you could find.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.080]   And you'd put the ruler across it.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.000]   You'd rip the story off.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.840]   You would do very minor markup to it.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.200]   Mostly you'd just pre-read it to make sure
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.080]   you could pronounce the names.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.400]   And then you'd go on the air with it.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:49.760]   Of course you--
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.520]   Like Yoda?
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.960]   Like, have you been alive for the young years?
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.160]   What?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.520]   Was that--
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.240]   This was very recent.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.480]   Very, very.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.280]   Well, OK, it was 30 years ago.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.600]   But it was relatively recent.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.480]   I'm going out right after the show and buying some
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.240]   recent formula.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.680]   So you'd rip it and you'd read it.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.280]   And that was-- but now remember, these radio stations,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.080]   TV stations, newspapers paid, associated press, paid UPI.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.640]   They syndicated material to them.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.360]   So at that point, attribution was-- you wouldn't say, oh,
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.600]   from the UPI comes a story, would you?
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.720]   No, I was also argued that, of course,
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.240]   you broadcast the foods.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.920]   We'd just rip the paper up and read it, too.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.040]   Well, OK, maybe once in a while.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.840]   So I'm still doing the same thing.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.480]   Like, he'll report.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.240]   I haven't done any enterprise reporting
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.960]   since I was a younger man, much, much, much younger.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.880]   But Danny did some.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.600]   And occasionally a blogger will do some enterprise reporting
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.400]   and come up with something.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.720]   And he certainly deserves credit.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.880]   The story is, how responsible is Google
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.440]   for giving out bad directions on Google Maps?
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.880]   Lauren Rosenberg is suing Google in Utah
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   because she googled walking directions for a trip
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.920]   in Park City, Utah.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.600]   Google led her onto a highway where she was hit by a car.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.480]   Let's see, the person who hit Rosenberg, Patrick
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.640]   Harvard, is being sued as well as Google
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.960]   for damages in excess of $100,000.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.000]   So she used her BlackBerry to get these directions.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.040]   And it said, walk along about half a mile along the Deer
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.920]   Valley Drive.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.680]   Well, apparently, there's no sidewalk.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.640]   It's basically a highway.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.400]   She got hit.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.200]   We're getting mixed signals from her lawyer
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.040]   lawyer saying, well, it was dark.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.760]   She couldn't tell it was a highway.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.960]   But aren't you a little bit responsible?
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.000]   A lot.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.920]   You're a lot responsible.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.640]   And isn't there a disclaimer on Google Maps that says--
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.360]   Ah, there is.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   --that directions are approximate?
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.480]   Except not on the BlackBerry.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.600]   Oh, come on.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.160]   They left it off the BlackBerry.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.160]   I didn't notice it was a highway.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.760]   So I just followed what Google told me on my BlackBerry
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.640]   at night, and I got hit.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.560]   So it's their fault.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.920]   Google's never lied to me before.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.360]   You know what?
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.520]   This is just deep pockets.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.040]   You're going to sue wherever you can.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.600]   The next one you're going to see is I crossed the street
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.360]   while watching my iPad.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.080]   You distracted me.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.240]   As somebody in the chat room said,
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.120]   there's no fix for stupid.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.800]   Computers can do a lot, kids.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.200]   They're all really ultimately--
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.120]   They're going to sue the chat on their--
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.320]   --human brain to make good decisions.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.600]   Yes.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:42.120]   I did a laser tag battle with my kid and his friends on Monday.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.520]   And I turned on my tracks.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.840]   We were up in the woods in Loma Mar in the red woods,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.680]   and I turned on my tracks.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.120]   Oh, I want video of that.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.560]   Well, you know, yeah, there's no video,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.680]   but the MyTrax did a great Google map.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.200]   It is really--
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.000]   I love that app.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.520]   I love it.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:55.800]   I love it.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.080]   I'm using it now.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.720]   I walk a few miles or walk around a few miles every day,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.480]   and I turn it on.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.400]   You can export to CSV.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.600]   You can bring it into a spreadsheet.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.840]   You can do like kind of like--
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.320]   Well, you can--
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:05.960]   --charge your--
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.000]   --your mileage.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.760]   It's awesome.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.680]   So here's the-- this is the laser tag
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.720]   plot of me running around with my gun.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.800]   Now, of course, we're in the woods.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.400]   So all you see is tree tops.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.440]   That is awesome.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.280]   But I know from that app that I ran 0.7 miles, averaging
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.200]   5 miles an hour.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.600]   I mean, it's really kind of cool.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.560]   That is performance art right there.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.720]   It's kind of a random walk.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.920]   That's a great idea, Gene.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.800]   Oh, Gene, it's a whole game.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.560]   Use it to make pictures.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.320]   Make pictures, yes.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   There's an interesting app on the Evo that's
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.280]   an HTC Sense app called Footprints.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.600]   Did you-- have you played with that at all?
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.240]   Were you supposed to take pictures as you go around and--
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.520]   Oh, no, I haven't played with it.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   Yeah, it's kind of an--
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.840]   It's kind of an need app.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.680]   Back a couple of years ago, Yahoo built these custom bikes
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.480]   that had an OKA phone kind of built into the handlebars
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.000]   and had a motion detector.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.680]   So they'd written this Python script
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.080]   so that when you were riding the bike,
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.040]   it would snap a picture every minute or something
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.960]   and upload it to Flickr with GeoTagged.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.640]   So a few people had gotten the bikes.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.800]   I got them, and it was really fun.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.760]   But somebody had done that.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.480]   It was during the Obama campaign and had drawn the letters
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.840]   to Obama and the city's just--
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.320]   By riding around.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.240]   Yeah, with the heavy images.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.520]   That's a lot of work.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.280]   It was really, really neat, really clever.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.600]   And that's what that reminds me of.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.240]   And so you really could do that with my tracks.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:23.880]   There is.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.120]   Now, if you do Google Latitude--
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.680]   and we were talking about the kind of potential privacy
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.240]   issues with latitude, but Google now
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.840]   has a thing called location history.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.920]   Have you seen this?
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.960]   Yes.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.200]   I don't know how to feel about it.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.480]   Have you turned it on?
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.520]   No, you haven't been using latitude?
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.960]   I'm using latitude.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.800]   But history is disabled on my account.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.880]   So I guess you have to--
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.440]   what the hell?
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   What the hell?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.360]   I'm turning it on.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.840]   The answer closed his Facebook account.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.800]   Isn't that how it's not?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.280]   What the hell?
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.600]   Handing over his location information.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.840]   Just a tip, kids, though.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.080]   If you want to commit a crime, you
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.960]   want to turn this off before so that it's not offered in court.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.880]   But now I can find out what the best restaurant in San
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.280]   Francisco is tonight.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.120]   I'll tell you where.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.640]   We have a 5.30 reservation.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.680]   Can my daughter-- hey, when's Jacob graduating?
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.000]   Not until the 24th.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.800]   They go a long way.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.200]   Abby graduates on Friday.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.560]   There's just one farming time.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.200]   Yeah, we're in farm country.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.000]   Gotta get out there in the fields.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.600]   Yes.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.120]   Yep.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.520]   Got to cultivate that pot.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.880]   That's next, by the way.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.480]   I fully believe that it's come September or November, rather.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.320]   There is an initiative in California
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   that will legalize marijuana.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   I fully believe will pass.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.360]   Have you needed to tax money?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   We need the money.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.040]   And I think they'll make a very credible case
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.360]   that everybody's already stoned in California anyway.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.000]   And maybe that will calm down the Google Apple Rift.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.040]   Maybe that's the solution.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.560]   Google cafeteria stash.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.480]   That'd be good.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.720]   Yeah, you get the free food.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.880]   And then on your way out, as you head to the segways,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.360]   just pick up a dooby.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.200]   Free bongs.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.120]   Free bongs.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.920]   Anyway, Google looks--
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.800]   geez, we have gone downhill here.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   Google location history.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.640]   Keep track of your latitude location history.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:16.160]   So this will show you everywhere you have been, ever.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.960]   Because your phone's latitude, this is the weird thing about--
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.760]   I actually want that.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.960]   I mean, I'm fine with it.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.320]   I have no big objection.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.440]   But what's the actual utility to that?
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.960]   Beyond Gina saying, because you can't, and it's cool.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.600]   Well, I mean, it's just this like--
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.560]   it's kind of like-- I don't know.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.200]   I started using Forscrew, and I really like it.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.440]   Because I just had to have this--
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.360]   I think Corey Doctorow calls it Myware
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.160]   versus Myware.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.880]   Just being able to look at where you've been,
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.320]   there's something compelling.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.080]   I mean, that's very navel-gazy.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.580]   It is.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.760]   What's it like to tell you about being
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.280]   able to look at a map of the world and be like, I have been.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.760]   It's the big world map with the pins on it, right?
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.360]   This is where I've been.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.920]   Everybody does that.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.440]   Have you seen check-in?
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.560]   This is the next stage.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.680]   Because, OK, you've got Forscrew now, Gina.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.960]   Then you're going to do Goala, right?
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.920]   And then you're going to add in, in, in, in, in, in.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.600]   Pretty soon--
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.360]   I know, Forscrew is the gateway driver.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.520]   Every time you start-- you get somewhere, my wife thinks I'm nuts.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.520]   I pull out my phone and I start going, hmm.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.080]   What are you doing?
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.320]   I'm telling everybody where I am.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.520]   So Brightkite, which is a loser in this, right?
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.240]   Everybody's going to these new game things.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.520]   Brightkite has created something called check.in that
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.480]   checks you into all of them.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.320]   M.check.in.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.200]   But that means-- so how many are there?
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.280]   There's four square Goala and latitude.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.480]   There's whirls.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.400]   And then there's--
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.560]   I've never heard of whirl.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.640]   I think I've heard of Brightkite.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.680]   There's more all the time.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.240]   Brightkite was one of the first.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.000]   And then there's the Yahoo one.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.360]   Oh, the fire eagle.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.000]   I want to call it flame out, but it's fire eagle.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.400]   But that ties into your--
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.160]   Anyway, you asked the absolute right question, Jeff, which
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.880]   is why the hell would you use Google Latitude?
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.480]   Because basically what you've done
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.800]   is you've turned on a homing beacon that everywhere you go--
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.360]   at least you check in with Goala.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.520]   You don't have to check in.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.680]   Or for you, Gina, if you don't want people stalking you,
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   check in as you're leaving, which is my recommendation.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.320]   Or I like the idea of doing it every midnight you check in
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.760]   for what that day held in the past.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.880]   A lot of these won't let you do that.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.680]   That makes sense to me as a safety issue.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.640]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.800]   I think that's a better way to do it.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.640]   A lot of them--
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.280]   Gina, you've gotten over your hinkiness about the four square?
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.760]   Yeah, well, I mean, I'm completely private,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.200]   and I only friend people who I would invite over to my house.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.760]   So I have a very small friend who are close, real life friends.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.600]   So I get a lot of firm requests, and I ignore them.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.480]   Unless I really know you, then I don't.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.680]   And I don't check in at home.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.000]   I have rules.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.640]   I often check in just before I leave.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.240]   I don't check in at home.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.640]   I check in at places kind of far away from where I live,
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.680]   and not so much a place as close to where I live,
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.400]   that kind of thing.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.240]   So I have these little rules.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.680]   But yeah, I kind of got over it a little bit.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.520]   I started to try it.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.760]   And it's kind of fun.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.520]   It's kind of fun.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.520]   It's really fun.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.040]   I have a lot of fun--
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.520]   Has any of that have come to you in terms of saying,
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.200]   oh, I didn't know that she was there.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.880]   That's the idea that these are like urban hipsters who then
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.280]   kind of coagulate, right?
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.320]   So, oh, Gina's at my favorite bar.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.120]   I'm going to go down.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   But does that ever happen?
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.400]   Because you're an urban hipster.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   It doesn't happen to you.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.760]   It doesn't work to you.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.960]   It is happening at conferences like at Google I/O.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.680]   I can see where people were near the convention center.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.560]   It happens in New York.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.840]   So this is what I really like.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.400]   I can watch.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.360]   I have a lot of friends in New York,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.840]   because I live there for my whole life.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.600]   And so I can see kind of all the new places
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.320]   that my friends go to.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.080]   So I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   I really want to go back to Shake Shack,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.200]   when I go back to Manhattan.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.400]   I really want to go to Sambar.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.920]   So I create this kind of mental to-do list of, oh, yeah,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.560]   my friends have been spending time at this place,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.400]   and I want to check it out next time I'm there.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.360]   So--
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.840]   Don't you want to proscriptive version of 4 Square, then?
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.360]   That lets you organize the rendezvous?
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:47.720]   Using 4 Square to organize like a get together?
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.040]   Yeah, you can't do that, can you?
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:49.640]   No.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   No.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.640]   She'll be able to say, I will be here at this hour,
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.120]   rather than I just got here.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.480]   Right.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.320]   Like, it meet me there.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.160]   No, I use the flow.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.600]   That's meet up.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.480]   That's meet up, right?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.240]   It's meet up, yeah.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.160]   No, meet up is about organizing things.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   Meet up.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.240]   Yeah, yeah, meetings about--
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.520]   Is there anything that's interesting?
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.480]   Is there anything proactive that you could do?
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.240]   That's not kind of obvious, isn't it?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.880]   Obviously, you, Jeff, because you are a big brain.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.680]   Well, I mean, yeah, just upcoming or Facebook events or--
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.640]   Facebook is happening.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.480]   Yeah, but it's not--
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.320]   Just all you need to do is take 4 Square
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.560]   and be able to manipulate the clock both ways.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.840]   Right, and say, I'm going to be here for long.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.160]   I'm sure the rumor I am right now,
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.440]   because it makes me hinky.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.520]   But the more I can post-date that,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.400]   the happier I am to share more.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.960]   Right?
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.800]   Let me easily do that.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.600]   And then also, let me do it prospectively and say,
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.880]   at noon today, I'm going to be a Shake Shack.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.280]   Who else?
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.200]   That would actually be a really good use of it.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.360]   And then there's a business angle, too,
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.840]   because then at some point, Shake Shack says,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.600]   if you can prove that you brought 10 friends,
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   I'll give you a free burger.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   See, now you're talking.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.960]   That would be really cool.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.960]   That would be super cool.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.160]   And then I'm sure these are obvious models
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.000]   that are coming along, because--
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.920]   Yeah, they're coming along.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.280]   Yeah, Starbucks is giving a buck off a frappuccino
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.480]   to the mayor of the local Starbucks, things like that.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.320]   That's not enough.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.640]   More and more, you're going to see coupons
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.400]   and all of that stuff.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.320]   So a couple of big stories we should whip through here
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.680]   very quickly.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.080]   Google Vice President says Chrome OS is coming out
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.920]   in the fourth quarter.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.600]   Really?
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.600]   Oh, you're--
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.080]   I don't know.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.040]   I want to try--
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.080]   What do I need to Chrome?
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.440]   I don't understand why I need Chrome OS.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.080]   I want to have a small device that's not a tablet.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.320]   That's a netbook, and I do not want Windows.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.920]   It's that simple.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.480]   But Android gives you-- well, honestly, why do I need
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.440]   Chrome versus Android?
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.680]   Yeah, just to have-- I mean, really, if you like the browser,
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.560]   just sit in the-- don't ever close the browser.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.840]   I mean, that's all Chromium is, really.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.680]   Or Chromium is, right?
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.800]   Yeah, I mean, Chrome OS really kind of
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.600]   was like a bet on netbooks, right?
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.760]   And in a post in a tablet world, the netbooks already
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.880]   seem kind of anti-- even though I love mine,
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.200]   I mean, they already seem kind of a little bit out, right?
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   It shows you the fastest of moves, doesn't it?
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:09.720]   Wow.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.720]   Yeah, I mean, things really do move.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.800]   So it's like, I don't know, Chrome OS on my netbook.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.320]   I'm interested to see-- I liked what they had to say,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.680]   when asked about Chrome OS versus Android,
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.800]   they said, well, we're going to put them both out in the market
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.360]   and see what does better.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.240]   Why not?
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:27.760]   Yeah, why not?
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.200]   You got more PhDs than God.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   I mean, you might as well just release stuff.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:31.720]   Yeah, sure.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.840]   See what happens.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.480]   Definitely.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.200]   Some-- you got to do something with that 20% of it.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.520]   Yeah, the problem with that is if you start to get
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.960]   for development, people are developing for one platform
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.320]   or not the other, or it's too expensive to deal with Google
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.800]   because you got to develop for two platforms, that's a problem.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.840]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.720]   But I mean, if you're developing HTML5,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.200]   they work anywhere, right?
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.120]   I mean, if you're building my apps, which
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.000]   is what they want you to do, Google I/O
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.280]   made it pretty clear they're going to work everywhere.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   And I do have to say, I think in one sense,
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.360]   I agree with you, Jeff, because I think one of the problems
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.160]   Android's going to face is there are too many phones.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.080]   They come out too fast.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.960]   There's too many updates.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.560]   And consumers go, woo, it's too confusing.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.240]   There's too many skews, or worse, I'm
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.000]   afraid I'm going to buy something and it's going to be outmoded
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.800]   before I get it home.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.640]   Or that's one of the reasons, oddly,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.880]   not to buy the newest phone is because it doesn't
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.880]   have the newest OS.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.400]   Right.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:16.900]   Right.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.160]   That's what's holding me back on the e-mail.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:18.960]   Oh.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.960]   I'll offer you.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.360]   By the way, by the way, let me just ask a question here.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.200]   So I haven't done the manual downloader for you.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:26.700]   Oh, dude.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.440]   What I'm hearing and what I'm afraid of is that then I will not
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.000]   get automatic updates.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.640]   Hence.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.520]   Oh, I don't know about that.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.360]   Do you know what you're doing?
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.200]   No, I don't know about that either.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:35.560]   You're kind of unlikely.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.520]   I think you will.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.600]   I think you will.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.240]   I don't think it matters.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.000]   But I don't know.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.520]   Yeah, I don't think it matters either.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.280]   I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.400]   Well, I mean, you could wait for the over-the-air update.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.720]   It's probably going to come soon.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.280]   They said the next week.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.440]   I'm surprised it hasn't come yet.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.240]   No.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.120]   No one lies to me.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.920]   I go there and I say, you know, update.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.760]   No, you're up to date.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.480]   No, I'm not.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.800]   There's more stuff.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.520]   It doesn't-- I'll be honest, as nice as Froyo is,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.440]   it's not something like you're going to go, wow.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.600]   Really?
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.840]   I mean, it's definitely faster.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.440]   But day to day--
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.800]   I don't know if the keyboard was better.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.080]   I don't know.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.520]   Have you noticed a better keyboard, Gina?
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   I guess doesn't have that weird loss of--
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.240]   doesn't have that weird thing where it starts to get crazy.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.920]   I use the-- I use ShapeRider.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.280]   Oh, that's right.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.040]   You don't know.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.320]   Yeah, so I'm not even sure.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.160]   Actually, I like the Evo keyboard better.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.400]   It's a little noisier.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.400]   It is a little-- it is a little noisier.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.440]   It is a little bigger.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.280]   The Evo keyboard is--
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.480]   like, the keys feel bigger?
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:29.800]   Maybe.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.000]   Is it because the screen is bigger?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.320]   I know.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.360]   But it does feel--
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:32.920]   I think it's--
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.760]   I'm not noticed with the Android keyboard versus the Apple
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.320]   because I'm still using both.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.240]   Is that the iPhone has spaces around the keys.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.600]   Right.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.640]   You can hit the middle space and not have it do something--
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   it's a lot easier.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.400]   I'll be honest.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.680]   It's a lot easier to use the iPhone, I think.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.040]   It is.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.880]   The Evo is closer, though.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.960]   Much closer.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.000]   And it has some nice stuff.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.240]   Like, you press and hold, and it will default to caps,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.640]   or you'll get the default punctuation.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.560]   So it's a little faster to type.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.360]   You know what 2.2 adds?
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.800]   It's a little subtle, but I really like.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.640]   Is if you type a word, it doesn't know.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.360]   It will give you an opportunity to add that word
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.240]   to your dictionary.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:10.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.400]   Hallelujah.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   You'll finally know my name.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.280]   Yeah, I yelled at it when four times in a row.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.280]   It's--
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.280]   If I don't hit the red thing, it'll--
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.440]   you're wrong, Jeff.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.000]   You're wrong, Jeff.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.800]   And you know what I don't like about the Evo
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.400]   is it has arrow keys on the keyboard
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.760]   instead of the little track ball for the cursor movement.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.280]   I don't like that.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.960]   Yeah, that's not so good.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.520]   The magnifying glass thing that the iPhone OS does
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.800]   is definitely--
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.960]   Everybody should do that.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.000]   Everybody should do that.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:37.640]   Why--
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.240]   Maybe it's patented.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.480]   Oh, it's patented, yeah.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.680]   Yeah, I'm sure that it's patented.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.280]   It is definitely much better executed
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.600]   than the select text.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   But--
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.440]   mechanism on Android.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.680]   But I do prefer the Android guess.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.880]   Yeah, the subject is--
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.440]   Yes, much better.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.880]   --the gesture text is better, definitely.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   You can see very clearly what's coming, what's
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.240]   going to be guessed, and you can modify it.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.480]   So Leo, you're probably going to buy an Evo.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   I think so.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.680]   And I'm told that the Evo is going to update to 2.2
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.240]   pretty quickly.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.520]   But of course, we thought that Nexus 1 would update quickly.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.440]   The problem with updating these HTC Sense devices
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.000]   is they have to update Sense as well.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.880]   So it's not up to Google.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.840]   It's up to HTC.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.360]   Or--
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.200]   Gina, when your month is up, will you subscribe to Evo?
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.600]   Well, that's right.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.920]   You get the phone free, but you still
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.360]   have to pay for it if you're going to keep it.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.680]   Yeah, because you get 30 days for service.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.480]   And then once the 30 days are up, you're done.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.440]   I'm in a contract.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.920]   I just have to look up to see how much it's
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   going to cost to get out of my T-Mobile contract.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.360]   So they have a contract with T-Mobile.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.760]   I did the month on T-Mobile.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.920]   I'd say the full freight.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.480]   So I can get out.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.920]   Right, right, so that you could do that.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.760]   See, I was talking--
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   I paid a lot of money.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.800]   I paid the penalty of proc.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.560]   Right, right.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.800]   So you paid, right, right.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.960]   So I have to look into it.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.480]   I'm tempted.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.200]   I mean, the Evo is really, really nice.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.600]   It isn't nicer than the Nexus 1.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.400]   I'm not sure if it's so much nicer than I
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.480]   would be willing to pay the extra to get out of the pocket.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.000]   OK.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.960]   You have to get an incredible as soon as possible.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.120]   I want to hear your comparison.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.880]   OK, Tony upstairs has an incredible--
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.800]   like I said, I've played with it and love it.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.200]   And if we're choice between the Nexus 1 and the incredible,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   I definitely get the incredible.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.240]   Because it's just a better Nexus 1, right?
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.720]   With the OLED screen and everything.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.280]   So really, again, it comes down to Verizon Sprint, doesn't it?
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.360]   Or Verizon T-Mobile Sprint?
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.800]   Well, on the models as well.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.080]   Well, I mean, if carriers didn't matter, I would say--
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.640]   I think this bigger screen does make a big difference.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.520]   So if they get this to 2.2, I would--
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.200]   and by the way, you don't have to use HTC Sense.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.120]   You can use the standard Google launcher if you want.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   So you're not stuck, but you still
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.320]   get to keep the widgets and so forth.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:43.840]   Oh, really?
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.760]   How do you--
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.600]   It's just the default launcher.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.920]   So in the settings, you can say what the program defaults are.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.480]   Oh, OK.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.760]   So you've got a launcher and--
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.320]   Oh, I just had it.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.600]   You've got applications, HTC Sense,
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.800]   and you say forget the defaults.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.200]   And then the next time you exit out, it'll say, well,
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.720]   do you want to use launcher or sense?
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.760]   And then you use launcher.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.440]   And it looks just like the standard Google experience.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.360]   The standard Android.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.400]   So that's kind of nice.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.280]   You have that choice.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.200]   But you get to keep the widgets, which I like.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.720]   The widgets, I think, are better.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.200]   And I wish the HTC would just release those for sale
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.360]   on the marketplace.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.280]   Andy Rubin said-- he told the Mercury News
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.960]   that they're going to go to a once a year update, which
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:32.360]   kind of does respond to that issue of over updating Android.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.440]   Is that a disappointment to you?
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.520]   I think it's a disappointment.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:34.960]   I'd like to--
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.280]   Yeah, I want to know the progress.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.120]   It's always getting better.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.920]   So here, Gina, I'm going-- I'm going, scrolling down to HTC Sense.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.600]   And then you've been here before.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.000]   And then right here, it says clear defaults.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.920]   Right, clear defaults, right, right.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:54.320]   So you'll force stop it so that it's not running.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.960]   And then you clear the defaults.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.760]   And then now when I hit home, it's going to say,
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.840]   whoa, do you want to use sensor launcher?
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.360]   Nice.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.400]   If you say use launcher by default,
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.800]   now you have to redo all your widgets,
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.600]   because the launcher doesn't know anything about.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.680]   But now we're back to a standard Google phone.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:10.920]   OK.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.280]   All right.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:11.920]   There's a standard--
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.280]   There's a little thing.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.480]   This is a Sense wallpaper.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:14.920]   I like it.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   It's a live map.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.360]   This is one of the live wallpapers.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.160]   Oh, nice.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.660]   Yes.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.400]   I've seen that one.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.800]   Yes, I love it.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.000]   That must hog battery.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.600]   Oh, God.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.360]   Yeah, that must hog battery.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:25.800]   Oh, hell.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.080]   Well, you can leave the GPS off.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.720]   And then it doesn't know-- the map's wrong, but at least--
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:32.680]   Wow, it's a map.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.040]   But it is a map.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.160]   In fact, it is wrong right now.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.920]   I think this is not where I am.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.800]   I actually like to release early and often.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.720]   But at the same time, I think a once a year release cycle
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.760]   is sane.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.680]   And I also-- I mean, when it's once a year
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.000]   and you're getting a new release,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.800]   you kind of expect it to be significant.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.960]   God help Kevin Purdy, my coworker,
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.240]   live-acre is writing the Android book.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:56.840]   That's true.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.880]   I mean, it's so tough for him between all the different
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.160]   handsets and all the different builds
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.680]   and now the different UI.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.360]   It's tough to kind of keep up with.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.000]   I mean, you know, the Android--
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.160]   Well, that's Gina.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.400]   That's because you write your code by hand.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:16.520]   See, when you hand write code, it really--
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.440]   it just adds a little extra work.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.120]   My suggestion-- get a text editor.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.360]   This was my Memorial Day.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.960]   I kind of like overloaded on screen time.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.520]   I just sat down with my notebook
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.800]   and just started sketching out code.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.440]   It's very, very satisfying to write in a notebook.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.000]   So cute.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.240]   I'm writing code.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.120]   And I got a lot done after I did that little jotting
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.080]   session there.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.320]   You didn't type the code in.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.880]   Well, yeah, really.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.040]   This is how Neil Stevenson writes his programs, actually.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.760]   No, I mean, I was just defining interfaces.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.360]   Like, I wasn't writing the meat of the body of the--
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.280]   You were thinking.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.720]   This is thinking, though, which is great.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.960]   Because just thinking is just sketching out
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.920]   and thinking out because--
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.800]   Sometimes we type too much and think too little.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.240]   So I don't think this is so bad.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.360]   I think better with a pen.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.840]   I love that feeling of the pen against paper.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.480]   I still carry a notebook and a pen.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.280]   I even though I've got my Android phone and my laptop and stuff.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.840]   Daniel Book says you've got to get mono-spaced paper, though,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.400]   if you could--
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.920]   And then someone said, I like your version control.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.800]   Because I date every page of my notebook.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.320]   It's a top 531 from them.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:18.820]   Sure.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.320]   You know exactly when you wrote this.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.960]   This is version 69 from 531.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   Of course.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   That's page 69.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:26.740]   Oh, page?
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.640]   But that same thing.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.000]   Look at that.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.840]   That's so funny.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.240]   She writes, she thinks in Java.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.720]   Is it a PHP or--
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.680]   It's PHP, but PHP 5 is--
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.680]   It's just like Java.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.000]   It looks so much like Java now.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.440]   Especially if you use PHP Document,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.360]   or it has the same Java doc format.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.520]   And I'm using Eclipse.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   So if you open up on my PHP file,
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.020]   it's like--
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.840]   It looks like Java.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.360]   It's amazing.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.600]   Jeff, I apologize.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   We don't--
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.640]   Little geek out moment there.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.600]   Just ignore us.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600]   That's fine.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.360]   But the PHP file--
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   You're here in security now.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.920]   Interface is the whole thing.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   I'm loving PHP.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.440]   So yeah.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:04.920]   OK.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.440]   Wow.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440]   You don't hear that a lot.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.120]   I'm loving PHP.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.720]   You don't.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.960]   PHP doesn't get the love.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.480]   It deserves.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.160]   It's about Ruby.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:12.760]   PHP.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.240]   How many languages do you speak to?
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.720]   Here?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.520]   As many as I can Google code-step it's for.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.440]   There you go.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   That's the key, isn't it?
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.400]   I'd say M2 or 3 that I feel pretty proficient in.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.880]   But I'm kind of a copy and paste.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.080]   I teach myself, read the docs.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.480]   And they're all variants of C. So if you kind of know C,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.880]   you can know Java, Python, Perl, Java,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.360]   and C in graduate school.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.240]   So you can apply that not the elsewhere.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.520]   Start with C. You're all right.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.080]   You're good.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.320]   You're good to go.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.120]   All right.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.360]   Let's get our tip tool and number of the week
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360]   and wrap this thing up.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.600]   Boy, this has been a fun show.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.160]   I'll tell you.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.680]   It's my highlight of my week, guys.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.560]   I love how you do it.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.840]   You sent that in your email, Jeff.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.960]   And I thought that was very kind.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.000]   Because frankly, we feel so grateful to have you and Gina
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.240]   as part of the network and to be able to do this show with you.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.320]   I feel like I should be sending you guys massive checks
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:08.840]   or something.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.880]   I just heard at least a fruit basket.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.320]   Some--
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.720]   She said he sent us a blanket.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.600]   That did it for me.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.440]   I sent you a blanket.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.920]   You got to be for years.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.160]   You can't get those anymore.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.000]   They're valuable.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.920]   They're also limited edition blankets.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.520]   I mean, come on.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.000]   I think you should sell real report branded seat balls.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   We-- you know what?
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.160]   Actually, it's too bad calling left.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.760]   Because that was a project on here.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.200]   Really?
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.600]   Very, very long list.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.880]   Yeah, we were going to--
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.960]   Leo Leport branded bouncies.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.000]   Because I don't know.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.200]   But I don't have any stats to back this up.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.080]   But every time I meet somebody now, they say, oh, yeah,
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.840]   I sit on a ball too.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.520]   It's like, I think I've--
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.320]   I hope to God it's not like Steve Martin with the glasses
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:46.840]   thing.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.280]   Like, it's going to cause some sort of horrible spine damage
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.240]   in 15 years.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.040]   And all these people are going to sue me.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.920]   At least I'll have it too.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.160]   Your tip of the week, Cheetah Tarpani.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.920]   Tip this week.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.160]   Really simple.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.400]   Everyone knows that Google has a PDF viewer, right?
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.200]   So if you get a PDF attachment in Gmail, you can say,
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   you can click on the view link.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.920]   And it opens up in this browser-based viewer.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.960]   Well, I got a couple emails about this week.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.880]   I don't think there was an actual blog post about it
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.480]   anywhere.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.440]   But there's a new link there that says Save to Google Docs.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.920]   So you click on the Save to Google Docs,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.320]   and it moves the PDF right into your Google Docs account,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.560]   where you can save files.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.520]   So it's kind of simple one-click way to add PDFs
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.880]   to your Google Docs account.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.360]   Wow.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.320]   Cheetah, I've heard the weirdest thing also this week.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.280]   Every time I've tried to open the PDF that's
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.040]   been attached to an email, and it would open up to that viewer,
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.640]   it would open up.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.440]   Really?
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.800]   Oh, I don't know why.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.680]   It's not like I can get a new version of Gmail or something.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.480]   Yeah, was it not rendering at all?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.400]   Or was it just like, why?
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.120]   It just told me it can't.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.040]   And so it's the new version of Chrome.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.440]   I don't know if that's what it is.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:51.920]   I love Chrome.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.960]   Straight.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   I'm an--
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.080]   Well, I try to download it into Google Docs.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.160]   I'm having a love affair with Chrome, I confess.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.560]   I just-- it's so fast, and I just--
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.760]   I just love it.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.560]   Yeah, Chrome is pretty fantastic.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.640]   I loves it.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.280]   I don't know what that's about, Jeff.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.920]   I just tried that before.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.640]   Well, I was using Firefox, and I'm going to try it right in Chrome
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.960]   while you do your number of bits.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.360]   And I'm trying to find somebody's--
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.240]   nobody sends me PDFs anymore.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.160]   How do you get somebody to send you a PDF?
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.520]   No.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.400]   You work in my business.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.520]   Don't send me PDFs.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.320]   Please.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   PDFs, let me control the look and the feel.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.480]   What is this thing?
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.200]   Where PDFs are pretty useless, right, for the most part.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.040]   But every once in a while, you get that PDF.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.280]   Like, manuals.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.320]   I used to very diligently file away my paper manuals
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.080]   for my gadgets.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.640]   You can find them online as PDFs.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.920]   You can save new Google Docs account and save some file
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.840]   cabinet space.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.040]   Well, it's better than a .docx file or something like that.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.720]   Well, that's true.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.840]   If you do a search for has attachment in Gmail,
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.200]   has colon attachment.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.440]   I love it when she does this.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.200]   PDF.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.600]   It's just so hot.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.960]   That'll give you all your email with attachments.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.680]   Not only that, it's suggesting.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.480]   It's actually suggesting it has attachment.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.720]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.360]   It has attachment.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.560]   And then you can put PDF.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.760]   So I should say has attachment PDF?
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   Yeah, has attachment space PDF.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.560]   And also you just PDF files.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.960]   Wow.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.960]   Sarching.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.600]   OK, good.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.880]   Here's a PDF file.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.480]   Yep.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.560]   So I can view it.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.720]   Now I'm in Chrome, the latest Chrome format
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.760]   montage.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.200]   And it views it.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.600]   I'll show it.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.760]   Somebody's resume.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.280]   I won't show the rest of it.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.960]   But there's a save in Google Docs.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.120]   Like right there.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.480]   This is really, yes.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.480]   Really sweet here.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.320]   So I'll be honest.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.520]   I'm not a big fan of PDFs.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.040]   But I got like three separate emails from different listeners
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.880]   telling me how excited they were that they could finally
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   save their PDFs to their Google Docs account.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.480]   So hence the tip.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.160]   Save in Google Docs.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.040]   Saving.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.680]   Very nice.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.320]   And then it just shows up.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.200]   Your number, your Jarvis of the Week.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.360]   Number of the week is 71%.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.160]   Pew did another one of its wonderful surveys.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.320]   They really are the incredible source of great data
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.840]   that we'll use in the history books in the future
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.120]   about how the internet was made.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.560]   So Pew looked at young people on social networks
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.480]   and found that 71% of young people, that
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.920]   is to say young adults, 18 to 29,
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.280]   have changed the privacy statements on their profiles
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.880]   to limit what others can see.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.840]   And so all this argument that most people just
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.720]   go with the default.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.680]   That's really good news.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.200]   At that age, they actually trust it less.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.040]   They're savvier.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:35.280]   They do more compared to 55% of people 50 to 64.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.920]   That's really good news.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.760]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.080]   And as usual, we'll have more faith in our young than media
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.320]   people would have you have.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.000]   Like me, because that's one of the reasons I quit,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.160]   is I thought, oh, my kids don't get it.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.040]   I don't want to encourage anybody to use Facebook,
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.880]   because they don't understand how to make it private.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.240]   Good.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.880]   All my pick of the week is something
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.120]   I've been waiting for for a long time.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.640]   Audible has finally-- I don't know, actually,
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.680]   if it's coming from Audible or from Google,
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.440]   because it is in a Google code database,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.720]   has finally put out a beta of Audible for--
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Yay!
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.640]   Oh, sweet.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.000]   --for Android.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.600]   And this is it.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.040]   The download of the beta, the beta is free.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.480]   You log into your Audible account.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.240]   All of your titles are there.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.480]   You can download them right to the phone.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.800]   You don't have to hook it up to a computer.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.680]   You can search by title, by author, by length, recent.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.080]   It has a lot of nice features.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.040]   This is actually, I think, one of the sweetest Audible
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.960]   applications I've ever seen.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   Audible news is there.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.840]   You can even get stats.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.200]   Obviously, whoever wrote this is one of us.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   So how--
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.760]   And by the way, they've got a little game in here.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.200]   You can be an Audible Master, Audible Scholar, Audible Pro,
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.840]   Audible Navis, or Audible Newbie,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.720]   Newbie based on how much Audible you've listened to.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.280]   Smart!
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.320]   Is it in the market?
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:55.760]   Leo?
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.200]   Or do you think the download of the beta?
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.440]   It is not.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.840]   And look it, they have trophies just like Four Square.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.720]   They've got badges.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.760]   I love badges.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.280]   Is this really--
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.080]   This is very--
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.280]   Jada, you've interrupted.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.200]   I have been.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.600]   Four Square totally got me.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.960]   Yeah, this will show your total Audible listening time.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.800]   Today, daily, monthly.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.360]   I mean, I've never seen Audible app like this.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.080]   This is like the best app I've ever seen for Audible.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.040]   Your Audible titles, how many you've got.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.160]   This is just so cool.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:23.920]   So thank you.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.440]   I didn't know what you were listening
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.200]   as you were walking in that place.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.240]   Yes, that's all I need.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.000]   Yes, let's do a mashup, a Google Map mashup.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.840]   If you listen to audiobooks, you know this already, though.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.600]   If I go buy a spot that I was listening to--
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.640]   I'm talking about--
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.000]   I know what I was listening to,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.920]   but vice versa.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.160]   Isn't that weird?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.040]   It's very strange.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.800]   The brain does some strange things.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.760]   So that's not just me.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.880]   You do that too.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.400]   Yeah, I've done it with you.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.080]   I've got a listening to a podcast.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.000]   And this corner reminds me that Leo said blank.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.760]   You know, it's--
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.600]   That's weird.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.880]   So strange.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.000]   I was-- when I was memorizing my lines for some of the videos
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.160]   at "Different Fast Company," I talked to my editor
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.280]   who used to do some acting who said that when you try
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.080]   to memorize things, you should put your body
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.800]   in a different position or go to a place
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.920]   that you don't normally go because your brain kind of--
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.120]   Yeah, crazy.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.560]   --like synapses, right?
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.360]   Like, create these connections between those things.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.760]   So what they've done is they've created a Google group
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.560]   for the audible for Android beta.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.800]   So it's free to join.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.640]   You do have to join it.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.680]   There are currently only 381 members,
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.480]   but I bet that number goes up a little bit.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.040]   I'll bring it out.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.880]   And they've been putting out builds.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.480]   The most recent build is May 28.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.160]   Of course, there's all the usual disclaimers,
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.960]   but it does seem to work fine.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.640]   And by the way, it does work over 3G, if you should choose.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.680]   So this is pretty awesome.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.440]   And this is for-- only for, I'm sorry to say, audible in the US.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.840]   Audible, UK, DE, and FR.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.440]   It's not going to work for you, but they
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.080]   do plan international versions soon.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.240]   Really, a slick--
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:57.920]   I don't know.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.880]   Is it Google who did this?
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.380]   I don't know.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.440]   Whoever did this, they've done a great job.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.360]   And I haven't had trouble with 2.2.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.800]   I'm running on 2.2 right now.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.360]   When people rush to download that from our show,
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.600]   then it will prove to Audible, this
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.800]   is a good market for us.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.560]   You know, that's right.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.120]   Why aren't they advertising on this show?
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:14.800]   Eggs.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.160]   That's a very good point.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:16.640]   Eggs, I think.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.320]   They think that people who use the cloud don't read.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:20.920]   Something.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.840]   I don't know.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.560]   Jeff Jarvis is the man behind Buzzmachine.com.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.720]   He should be reading this blog.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.680]   I know he's just a blogger, but look, he's not as jammy.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.160]   He's also--
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.680]   And it drew a nation of us.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.160]   He's also written some actual books.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.280]   In fact, his new book, You Just Signed The Deal.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:38.840]   I can't wait.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.960]   It's called Private Parts.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.520]   No, public parts.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.760]   It's the response to private parts.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.160]   In a way.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.520]   I just put two and two together with that.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.680]   I didn't realize that's kind of a little play on the--
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.000]   The homage there.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.600]   --of the homage to Howard.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.720]   I hope it doesn't sue you.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.800]   It's public person there is.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   Nah.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.440]   Of course it's one.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.160]   Congratulations, Jeff.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:58.560]   That's awesome.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.160]   Isn't that great?
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.040]   I cannot wait to read it.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:00.840]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:01.920]   But you don't have to--
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.760]   I can't wait to write it.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.520]   Yeah, you don't have to wait.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.480]   Read his blog.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.120]   It's all there.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.640]   Buzzmachine.com.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.880]   And of course, what would Google do is the current book.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.560]   Thank you, man.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.200]   Gina's current book is the complete guide to Google Wave
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.880]   at completewaveguide.com.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.000]   You must get it if you use Wave.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.800]   And the nice thing is it's a PDF so you can update it.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.880]   Yes, we can update it.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.160]   And it's free on the website, which also gets updated.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.360]   That's a wiki.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.240]   And we're going to have the ePub file.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.800]   And it's available in the Kindle if you search on Amazon.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.480]   And we're going to have the ePub file available very, very soon.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.720]   And of course, Gina's site is smarterware.org.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.800]   But you see you're on Life Hacker and Fast Company
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.000]   and all sorts of other places, too.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.320]   I hope you will join us for the show.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.640]   We've moved it in case you didn't know to Wednesday
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.000]   afternoons, hoping to make it a little easier for you
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.640]   to listen and watch live at live.twit.tv.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.360]   The festivities begin at 4 p.m.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.120]   Eastern, 1 p.m.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.840]   Pacific time.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.360]   That's 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.160]   Or go to twit.tv/twig.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.040]   And you could subscribe to the audio or the video
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.440]   and get it whenever it's available.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.320]   The minute it's available.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.160]   Thanks for being here.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.800]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.100]   (upbeat music)
