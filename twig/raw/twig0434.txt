[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff has the week off with Stacey Higginbotham's
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.440]   year and Aaron Nookam, our favorite maker. We're going to talk about all the news, including
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.360]   Qualcomm. They've got some big announcements, both Stacey and Aaron know a little bit about
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.720]   Chip set, so they'll have a lot to say about that. Lawsuits flying between Mozilla and
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880]   Verizon, Oth, and a whole lot more. Of course, the biggest Supreme Court case of the year
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040]   and has a lot to do with your privacy. So coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.120]   It's time for Twig this Week in Google. The first episode of December 2017. And Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.080]   is off doing Santa Claus duties. So thank goodness Aaron Nukem has decided to fill in
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.440]   Jeff's more like a Grinch actually. What am I then? Am I a who? Yeah, you're in Whoville.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.680]   Aaron works at New Relic. He is a regular on all of our shows. A maker. In fact, he
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.280]   has founded the Benisha Makerspace. And I know you're doing a fundraiser for that,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.200]   which we want to plug. So hang in there. We'll tell everybody about how they can do that.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.000]   So before we do that, let me introduce Stacy Higginbotham, our regular from Stacy on IOT.com.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.800]   Great to see you Stacy from Austin, Texas. And you are not in, we were talking before
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.740]   the show. You're not in Hawaii, I gather. I am not in Hawaii. In my Austin home office
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.920]   where it is freaking cold, you guys. It's not cold in Maui, at least judging by Paul
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.080]   Thorett's Instagram. He's out there with an event, a Qualcomm Microsoft event. They've
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.520]   announced, we knew that they were working on Woa Windows on Arm. They've announced their
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   first arm laptops from some of the big companies. And the story of Windows on Arm is all, they
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.760]   say quote, all day battery life, which is kind of who knows what the heck that is. But
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.880]   I know you cover it. Is it a shot in the arm for arm? Well, it's interesting because
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.760]   it will, you could tell Paul's working really, really hard right now at the Grand Waialaya.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:51.320]   Nice. I have two. It's really beautiful. But anyway, no, I think that we'd also heard
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.160]   that Apple was doing arm or might be doing arm version. If Apple does, it'll be different.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.480]   Well, yeah, Apple licenses arms technology not to reproduce exactly. They've got an architecture
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.840]   license, so they'll probably do their own version of the arm chip. Right. And a desktop
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.260]   I am, I go, Wes might be on arm might be a very interesting product. It's kind of where
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.380]   Apple's had a given that arm runs everything else. Apple makes money on and I have, I've
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.660]   been waiting for this for like 20. So it's a since like 2010, maybe, because I was like,
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   you know, most of your computing, the same thing Google thought when they put out the
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.060]   pixel or the Chrome, Chrome cast Chromebook, whatever the Chromebook, the pixel book, is
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.620]   that everything can be most computing can be done in a browser. Yeah. And the browser
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.460]   equalizes everything. So why can't we start having arm? And for a while, it's because
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.460]   there was only 32 bit now there 64 bits. So now you can put it in servers, which we did
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.860]   that, we started building out, you know, OS is that would work for that. And now here
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.780]   we are. They run like they run cooler. They run lower power. They're not there. And there's
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.860]   their risk, not cis, right? That means does that mean inherently they're not as fast?
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.460]   I don't think so. No, they can. Well, so it used to be the case, right? Anymore, they
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.900]   can certainly be just as not as powerful as full blown. You know, you're not going to
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.820]   replace your gaming rig with arm these days. But you can certainly do desktop computing
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.140]   with arm and we're seeing that already with, you know, all kinds of devices that could
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.060]   be converted. In fact, Mike Elgin wrote a great post the other day talking about, you
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.540]   know, why not? What's the next thing? Why? Why not get rid of laptops and just use our
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.500]   phones everywhere? Put your phone into a monitor and keyboard and go for it. And I agree.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.260]   Actually, Samsung did that already with Microsoft's done it with what do they call it connect?
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.220]   The mic not what do they call it? They have a name for it. I think it's Samsung calls
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.820]   it connect. But I have this a DEX is the Samsung dock thing. You put your phone in, you connect
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.020]   it to HDMI to a monitor and to a mouse and a keyboard. And it's a much more desktop like
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.380]   version of Android than you'd expect. And given how much Microsoft's pushed its office,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.980]   for instance, to Android, they really an iOS for that matter, they're really pushing the
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.740]   mobile versions of office. Other apps are doing the same thing. I think it's just a
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.260]   short way off. Reason I mentioned this to you, Aaron particularly, because you've been
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.500]   using arm for a long time and things like Raspberry Pies. It's very popular with makers.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.300]   Yeah, exactly. And Windows actually Windows Microsoft actually released a version of Windows
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.300]   a few years ago for Raspberry Pi. They called it, let's say, IoT or something like that,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.620]   IoT version. But it wasn't very popular. You couldn't do much with it. You couldn't get
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.580]   a desktop. So all you could do is really get into a terminal. So it was really for developers.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.420]   And that's fine. But it sounds like where they're going here, obviously with getting
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.220]   vendors like Asus and so forth on board as they really want to bring Windows to the mainstream
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.900]   on ARM devices. And I think it's great. I think it's what's interesting about this is how
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.940]   will Intel respond? I think every time there's a competitive threat, Intel seems to force
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.180]   Intel into working even harder and doing something more innovative, it gets them out of their
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.740]   RUT so to speak. So I'm interested to see where Intel is going. Intel has kind of, I
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.540]   don't want to say shied away, but they've drawn back a little bit from, certainly from
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.740]   the developer maker community by getting rid of their Edison platform by the end of life
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.580]   in that. I know that was a thousand a lot of things, but that was like a year old, right?
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.180]   That was very quick. Intel fails at anything requiring power. I mean, if you played with
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:53.740]   one of those Edison boards, they ran so hot compared to Pi. It was not fun.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.900]   But people built, I mean, people built projects. They built ecosystems around the Edison, now
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:07.220]   they're all default. I don't think, oh, please. Oh, like, as a chip reporter, I have lots of
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.660]   thoughts on this. I know you do. I know you do. In fact, this isn't really exactly the
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.980]   right up the alley of this week in Google, but it's a big breaking story. And it kind
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.540]   of is. And since I have two people who know a lot about this subject, I thought, well,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:27.180]   let's talk about it. So I think Intel's big challenge, and I've said this before, is
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:35.860]   it's really good in general purpose compute. And we're moving away from that because we're
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.980]   putting it into devices that need to be mobile, or we're saying, hey, we want to do artificial
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.180]   intelligence, which is going to require massive parallel processing that Intel hasn't really
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.100]   been historically good at if we remember like Laraby and things like that. So the challenge
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:58.660]   here is can arm is power more important than general purpose processing and is armed good
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.180]   enough at general purpose now that it can actually compete with Intel in the laptop space.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:11.220]   And if you look at it like that, once if the market decides that arm based chips are, then
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.780]   crap. What does Intel do? Yeah, I mean, they did kind of weirdly one of those cats and
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:25.380]   dogs sleeping together stories. They did a deal with their arch rival radion, a A T I
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:32.780]   and AMD's radion to put a graphics processor in the die with the Intel microprocessor. And
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.220]   that may be one of the ways that they hope to respond. Obviously aimed at high end computing.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.740]   Today Qualcomm along with these laptops announced its Snapdragon 845. And it's interesting
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:50.500]   to hear where Qualcomm is aiming the 845. They mentioned that it will allow 4K HDR video
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:10:00.060]   capture on smartphones. They're going to focus on AI immersion, which I guess may be AR,
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.900]   their name for AR security connectivity. Immersion is the ability to capture and render the world
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.540]   around you at high resolution and quality for more realistic results. They do have a
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:19.540]   GPU. It'll be a dreano 630 this time around. And they're putting a image signal processor
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.460]   in the in the die as well. This is a 10 nanometer die, which means even though these chips are
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:31.820]   really small, Paul had a picture of the 845 at 10 nanometers, you can pack a lot of functionality
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:38.420]   into that little die. So it's funny. Yeah. Qualcomm's adreno, their graphics processor,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.260]   they actually bought from AMD after it bought ATI. Oh, way back in two now.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:52.340]   Interesting. That is funny. So that is interesting. Of course, the Pixel 2 XL just is about to
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:11:00.820]   get Android 8.1, Oreo 8.1, which would turn on the image processor in this phone, which
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.340]   hasn't been on up to now for those of us who have Pixel 2s. It'll turn that on. So I
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.020]   think that is telling also that the Qualcomm is putting an image signal processor into the
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:18.580]   845 as well. I don't know if it's the same one that Google's using. It's a Spectre 280
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.900]   image processor. No, people built their own, didn't they? Google did their own thing. Okay.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.860]   That's the other trend, of course. Apple and Google, everybody wants to build their own
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.340]   based on our architectures, but build their own. That's a different. That's why it's so
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.420]   good to be arm right now. It's good to be arm because they don't make any chips. They don't
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:44.780]   need to. Ultra HD color capture in these new chips. Cameras can capture more color volume
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:53.260]   than before. I think they mean that's a broader range of colors. Mobile phone.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.980]   Because you like hummingbirds or dogs. Yeah. So it's going to go from 8 to 10 bit color.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:06.500]   Wow. The color gamut will be rec 2020, which means just a little brighter. You know, the,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.060]   you know, Qualcomm's not going to say things like as the, well, it was the 810 that turned
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.260]   into it. You could also fry an egg with it. Or was it the 820? It was, it might have been
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.820]   the 820 or 21. I think it's 820. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, here comes the, you know, this
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.660]   is a battle that's going to rage. And I love it because, you know, who benefits from that
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:34.900]   kind of competition? It's us. So yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Whenever we used to talk to the big data
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.620]   center guys, like guys, arm is not even going to work on your servers. And they're all like,
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:46.100]   yeah, we got to keep Intel in line though. Well, and power is a big concern in data centers,
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.500]   right? That's like the biggest concern. It is. But our arm was not ready for the data centers.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.580]   But what's, what's really cool, and this is super kind of subtle, but I think it's worth
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.260]   talking about. So for a long time, you only had Intel in x86, right? And so what Intel
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.380]   gave you you took with arm because they offer these architecture licenses, you can actually
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.820]   develop a variety of different arm based chips to offer a vendor based on different specs,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.220]   which actually brings a lot more competition or potential competition and potential feature
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:22.500]   competition. Yeah. Look what you've got. You've got Apple. You've got Qualcomm. Are there
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.580]   other big arm, uh, licensees that I should be. Oh, yeah. Like Kaviam Google Amazon all has those
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:35.220]   all have architecture licenses in different now. They have gone in, I wish I had paid attention
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.300]   to their most recent shareholder thing, but they've gone from like having a dozen architecture
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:46.820]   licenses, like five years ago to having like more than 30. I mean, it's, it's a huge growth in
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.740]   architecture licenses. So here's a, I didn't know this. I'm learning something that they roll in zero,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.660]   zero in our chat room says, adreno, the name for the graphics processor in the Qualcomm Snapdragon
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:07.060]   chips is an anagram of radion. The tech, not of course the technology that AMD and ATI created.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.260]   It was originally called Im, Im, Imijian, which I think they had to change a name because how would
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.300]   imagine? Imijian? That was ATI's name. They acquired AMD acquired in 2006.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:27.620]   Qualcomm renamed Imijian or whatever the hell to adreno as an anagram according to a Wikipedia
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.940]   and rolling zero, zero and a radion. Anyway, we'll have a lot more on windows on arm and the new
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.980]   windows laptops based on the arm chip, which are definitely the proof of concept. Of course,
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.100]   Google's been doing this for a while because Chromebooks, there are arm Chromebooks, there have
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.780]   been for some time, you could get the Samsung Chromebook in arm or Intel flavors. And while some
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.660]   people seem to think that the Intel version that the Chromebook Pro is faster than Chromebook plus,
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.420]   I, I have two, I bought two Chromebook pluses for my kids and they love them. And I don't think
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.580]   they're slow at all and they run Android software perfectly well. So as you'd expect.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:11.620]   All right, let's take a little break. There's lots more to talk about including share. It's her fault,
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.900]   by the way, that everybody's agitating for all this net neutrality stuff.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.580]   Going to add it by it was a list of Milanos and a list of monos and
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:25.140]   as we speak is speaking in secret to his former employer Verizon.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.940]   Okay, we'll clarify that for you. Oh, he's not after after the break.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:39.220]   Oh, okay. There's a tease. What's the real story? Google's shutting down the apps section of the
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.340]   Chrome Web Store. We'll tell you what's going on there as well. Lots of big news here, but first a word
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.940]   for your shopping list. I have already purchased. I am so way ahead of the game.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:55.540]   I've already purchased many of the Christmas gifts I'll be giving in a couple of weeks,
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:01.220]   including 23 and me for my mother and my sister. We're going to have the whole family.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.260]   Oh, I have to get one more for my dad. I forgot. We're going to have the whole family. 23 and me
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.140]   is named after the 23 chromosomes that make you you. It's a personal genetic service
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.580]   that helps you understand what your DNA says about you. And right now is a great time.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.580]   I did 23 million years ago and I, you know, the nice thing about this is a gift that keeps on
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.860]   giving when you when you spit in that file and that's all you have to do. There's no blood
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.460]   drawer or anything. You just you'll get a little kit. They will get a little kit because I got it
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.860]   all packaged up for them and they just spit into it and then you send it back and then your reports
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:43.620]   appear online. And the reports are constantly evolving as we learn more and we are really in a
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:52.100]   period of learning an awful lot about our genetics. So as a really good example, when I first did 23
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:58.420]   and me, they didn't mention Neanderthals because at the time it was thought, oh, the Homo sapiens
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.380]   never interbred with Neanderthals. There's no Neanderthal genes in there. Then they were able
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.420]   to find some bones with Neanderthal remnants. They were able to analyze the genetics and they found
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:16.900]   out, yes, yes, we do have many of us Neanderthal genetics. Now with 23 and me, shortly thereafter,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:24.420]   they told me my Neanderthal ancestry. I have 265 Neanderthal variants. We didn't even know this
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:31.700]   until 2010. This is this is new stuff. I am less Neanderthal than most of you. It's only 4%.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:39.220]   But 4% is a big chunk of DNA, actually. If you think about it, so I'm in seventh place out of my
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:45.780]   family and friends in the Neanderthal category. But I don't yet have my sister and my mom in there.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.540]   I think it would be very interesting. Speaking of your mom, among other reports, you can get the
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:59.780]   maternal and the paternal haplogroup in your ancestry reports that show how your family migrated
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:07.940]   the maternal line around the world. Going back, if you go back far enough, 65,000, actually 180,000
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:15.220]   years ago, I, like most of us, came from Africa, Central Africa. Then 65,000 years ago, they migrated
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.940]   a little bit north to roughly where Kenya is. Then into the Middle East, 59,000 years ago.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:29.060]   Then a little farther north, 47,000 years ago to Central Europe. Then migrated from there into
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:34.980]   Europe itself. This is fascinating stuff. Another good thing about this gift is a great way to engage
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:43.300]   kids. By the way, I am in the same group as the Cheddar Man. That explains a lot. That explains.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:50.340]   First discovered in 1903 in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, England, Britain's oldest complete human skeleton.
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.260]   And he had the U5A variant in his maternal haplogroup as well.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.500]   So this is a great way for kids to learn about DNA in a way that engages them because this is
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:13.380]   what's great about this. It's about you. This is your report. It's always advancing. You can read
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.100]   about the research and the discoveries that have been made lately. They also offer you
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:25.700]   for downloading the raw data. For instance, when you learn about something, you can look it up
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:33.700]   and see if you have that particular gene that's been fascinating for me. You also learn a lot in
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:40.660]   the trait reports. The traits are kind of silly, but I think kind of fun. Like, can I smell asparagus
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:49.540]   odor? Likely. But I likely cannot taste bitter. And this is true. My genetics say I am likely to
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:59.220]   prefer salty or savory snacks. This is fun and informative and actually educational.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.980]   There's also a DNA relative finder tool that will help you connect with new relatives. I found
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:10.500]   a second cousin. It's so amazing. 23 in May, 75 online reports in ancestry, wellness, traits,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:16.180]   carrier status, and this holiday, you can give that as a gift that is as unique as the ones you
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:22.820]   love with a DNA kit from 23 and me. Now through December 26th, you'll get up to $50 off every kit.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:31.540]   That's why I bought a bunch of them. When you go to 23andme.com/twit. 23andme.com/twit.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:41.540]   Twit, make the holidays even more special. With 23andme.com/twit. And this is Anne Wojiski's
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:48.660]   company, one of the Wojiski sisters. Her sister Susan runs, or is it the other way around? I
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:55.060]   can never get them confused. Susan runs YouTube. Susan runs YouTube. Yeah. And Anne is, I don't
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.420]   know which one. Anne was married to Larry. No, Sergey, I can never. It's all, it's all
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:06.420]   intermittent. It's because their mom, Esther Wojiski, rented the garage to those young boys, Larry,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.700]   and Sergey when Google was first starting, and then the sisters, and then how that happens.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.660]   You can find out about it if you don't know in 23andme. All right, where did I get it wrong?
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.860]   Is Adjip Pi not speaking to Verizon? Stacey Hickenbotham.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:26.100]   He's at Verizon, but it is a telecommunications and media forum event.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.940]   Not a keynote. It is a keynote at this particular event, but there are other speakers, and he's
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:39.060]   not speaking specifically to Verizon. He's speaking to the 100-some-odd people who are at this particular
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:45.380]   event. And it's under the Chatham House rule. Oh, God, I saw that and I thought instantly of Jeff.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.860]   It's a British rule that the organizer, Verizon, applied to the
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:59.300]   organizer isn't Verizon. It's not? The organizer is the international institute of communications.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.060]   At Verizon's headquarters. The event for this particular event, it's held at Verizon's headquarters.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.100]   Oh, all right. So it really isn't a Verizon connected thing. It's just the venue.
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.380]   The venue is Verizon. The IIC operates on Verizon.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.700]   It's not the IIC. Okay. It's a nonprofit. I'm not saying that it's less, but it's a telecommunic.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:27.300]   It's an event for telecom people. All right. And the Chatham rules were applied by the IIC
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:35.860]   so that people can speak freely, I guess. Yes. So I mean, yes, is should Ajit Pai be hanging out
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.700]   at Verizon, you know, a week before he's trying to destroy any trade? The optics aren't great.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.300]   And he was formerly a counselor at Verizon, right? But the optics, I mean...
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.820]   Who cares about optics when you're at it? No one in this administration cares about...
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:56.900]   Who cares? We don't need to worry about optics. We are the government.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:03.300]   So he will, I think, be still holding the vote even though numbers of people have said,
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.980]   "Look, you can't have the vote because the comments are screwed up." We think they were...
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:12.100]   It was taken over by a lot of phony comments as many as a million phony pro...
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:18.020]   That's stole normal people's identities. I cannot... Yes.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.620]   That's what's so stunning. Not only are these robocoments, the robocoments masquerading as
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.460]   individual consumers' comments, which is... There's actually a database you can go to to figure out
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.460]   if your comments, more than half of the 21 million public comments supporting the rule change,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:42.660]   were likely faked. And faked, I might add, in the direction of repealing that neutrality.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.660]   So the attorney general of New York State, Eric Schneiderman, has put up a site where you can
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:57.780]   and to see if a comment used your name in vain. So you enter your name. And actually,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.220]   I did comment and this does not find my actual comment. So I don't know really if this
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.340]   is searching right now. That's the blank screen. And I see the little logo in the bottom.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.380]   We are searching. We are searching... I like state government web design right there.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:20.980]   Right there. Okay. Searched, Perg, delivery, FCC, NN, comment, Google Docs, PDF, updated,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.780]   come. I don't know. Is that my comment? Actually, I don't think this is... That might be your comment.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:33.940]   Well, is it? Let's see. Well, it's... Maybe I signed this. Oh, yeah. I must have been on the 50th,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:40.580]   6,000 signatures. Don't kill net neutrality. Well, if it was me or not, it might have been my
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.140]   dad's because one problem is we have the same name. Here's the net neutrality petition signers.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.740]   I don't think I sign any petitions. I don't really believe in petitions.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.500]   But I guess I'm on the list of signers for a couple of petitions.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.060]   And it may have searched all the way back to the original old 2015.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.820]   Yeah, it goes way back. But I'm... I've been very active.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:09.220]   My name was not used. Oh, here it is. I kind of... Here's my actual comment. Good. It does have it.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.020]   There. And that's it. And that is me. And it was disseminated. Does that mean they took the
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.340]   semen out of it? What does that mean? They disseminated it. They sent it to the commissioners.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.500]   Oh, good. That was sent that... I am an internet broadcaster. My company,
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.740]   Twit TV, creates video and audio programming that reaches 7 million people a month with revenues
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.740]   approaching $10 million a yearly. Our shows are distributed all over the world via the thing
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.700]   called the internet. We would not exist without a free and open internet. Last mile access to our
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:43.860]   audience via ISPs is critical and allowing ISPs to prioritize traffic could put me and my 25
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.900]   employees out of work. Please protect net neutrality, I said. That was quite eloquently...
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.940]   That is. That's a good comment. Well, I wanted them to understand the economic
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:59.700]   argument. Because that's the argument on the other side as well. We're just... We're lightning.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.380]   We're light touching federal regulation. But this is federal regulation of businesses that would
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:13.940]   do me harm. So I don't mind. Okay. I'm gonna take a deep breath. Your name was not using Vayne.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:21.780]   My name was not. No one who used Higginbotham in Vayne. No, it's... I'm probably not. I did write a
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.420]   story about net neutrality in my newsletter last week. And this doesn't get brought up a lot,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:32.420]   but I think it's worthwhile partially because I wrote it. So obviously I think it's worthwhile.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:38.740]   But the point I would like to make is, especially when it comes to IoT,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:47.460]   we don't know what we're building. We didn't know back in the early days of the web what we were
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.180]   building. We didn't know back in the days of mobile broadband what we were building and what
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:59.140]   would come of that. And the reason we got to that point is because people were allowed to innovate.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.140]   And frankly, once we got to wireless, it was because they were allowed to innovate around
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.940]   the carriers once Apple launched its App Store and Google launched their App Store.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:16.900]   So my thought in point here is, we're at another crucial development point in technology and of
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:23.380]   the internet with the internet of things. And to put these rules to abandon net neutrality now
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:33.060]   could shape our future at this point and make it different, probably worse, less innovative.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.060]   So that was kind of the point I was trying to make.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.980]   I guess you could make the argument, well, this is not the time when you have these nascent
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.620]   technologies, it's not the time to regulate because we don't know, as you say, we don't know where
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.260]   they're going. I'm just talking about net neutrality. We want to protect. It's like,
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:55.140]   we want to protect these and give them a chance to grow without the problem is the incumbents,
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.540]   the companies that are already doing it. And I include, by the way, Google, Facebook,
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.500]   Microsoft, Amazon. Okay. Well, no, because you're conflating two things. And I don't want people
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   to do this because the telco industry is really trying hard to conflate these two things.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.100]   Yes. In fact, that's one of the things Ajit Pai is saying is, but don't blame Comcast, blame Twitter.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:25.460]   So purely net neutrality right now, as it's regulated, is to deal with the issue of infrastructure,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.340]   which is anti-competitive here when it comes to broadband, or it's not competitive rather,
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:38.180]   not anti-competitive. And these incumbent players have too much power, just providing bits through
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:44.340]   a pipe. Now, if you want to talk about different layers, like if you think of your OSI stack,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.260]   right? If you want to talk about different layers, higher up at the application layer,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.140]   let's talk about Google and Facebook. But that is not a net neutrality issue to me.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:58.820]   That is a completely different issue. I'm not actually sure the FCC has the rules to regulate
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.620]   that. I know that they've kind of dabbled in it, but you could argue that FTC is better.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:09.220]   Yeah. And I would say that. I would say that. But I would also point out that that is why you
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.460]   can't really count on an alliance if you're at for net neutrality with these big companies,
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:22.500]   because frankly, it's not going to hurt them. Although we can go back to 2005 when Ed Wigdaker
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:31.060]   at AT&T said, I think the fundamental question that the ISPs are, this is what really is bugging
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:39.300]   them. He said, "Why should Google be allowed to use my pipes? The internet can't be free in that
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:46.180]   sense because we and the cable companies have made an investment. And for a Google or Yahoo or
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:52.020]   Vonage or anybody to expect to use our pipes free is nuts."
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:58.660]   But that's what consumers pay for. They just want it on both sides. And that is a stupid argument.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:08.660]   It was stupid back in 2005. And you know what's really, you know what really is frustrating/
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:16.260]   possibly one day could be hilarious is the cable companies, the ISPs have long had a decision to
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:22.180]   make and they've long chose the path of scarcity. And if you look at other parallels in technology,
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.500]   you will see a company like Intel way back in the 80s, they were like, "Hey, we've got this
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.860]   awesome chip technology and we can scale it up. Let's get people, let's fund people to actually
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.500]   build on this stuff." And they did. They funded EA. They funded all these companies.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.620]   And we as a country went out and bought faster and faster chips. And we bought them from Intel.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:47.300]   So, yay. The telcos instead of saying, "Hey, let's learn how to deliver broadband because we're
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.660]   really good at that and people are going to totally need this in the future. Let's figure out how
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:57.060]   to optimize our investments, deliver it super cheaply." I'll, Intel or Google or Facebook,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:04.020]   how they've done. They said, "No, no. Let's just figure out how we can control this and charge
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.940]   people extra money. So, we'll charge them coming in. We'll charge them coming out."
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:16.500]   It's a completely different way of thinking utterly at odds with the way that computers and
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:23.220]   technology work basically. So, yeah.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.900]   >> Yeah. >> Congress has been--
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.420]   >> And the other big part of this, real quick, and I'll let you jump in, Leo. The other big part
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.860]   of this drives me nuts. And I'm sure you guys have talked about this ad nauseam, but--
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.100]   >> Well, we're going to keep talking about it. As long as they keep assaulting it.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.780]   >> We should keep talking about it. But whenever the arguments that Stacey just made are brought up,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.940]   then they come back with its counter-argument that says, "Oh, well, it's okay because we should
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:52.100]   let competition improve the marketplace." Just let's let competition rule here. We all know that
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.180]   people have choices, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the fact is people don't have choices.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:01.140]   I can't go to an alternative. I have to use Comcast if I want the level of service that I get
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.780]   right now. If I want to do work from my home, Comcast is the only choice because the other
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:11.060]   alternatives I have aren't fast enough to allow me to do that. And so, that's another bogus argument
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.340]   that keeps getting thrown out as well. We should just let competition take over. It's like,
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.860]   we've been down this road. They tried to do this in the past when they first came up with
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.820]   these rules and regs. And they said competition would make this work and it hasn't made it work.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:27.300]   >> Congress is already-- >> And it won't go in forward.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.220]   >> Congress is-- Congress, by the way, which can override anything the FCC does. The FCC only operates
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:43.860]   at the oversight of Congress has received half a million calls from this site alone,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:50.900]   BattleForTheNet.com. Half a million calls. You could do it too if you go to BattleForTheNet.com.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   The vote is a week from tomorrow. But that won't be the end of it. BattleForTheNet
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:04.180]   points out that the next step is to pass legislation that actively allows throttling
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:09.620]   and extra fees and censorship on the internet. And so, they're not even done yet. First,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:15.780]   we repeal Title II regulation. But then Congress is going to step in, is expected to step in,
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:22.900]   and explicitly allow ISPs to start charging. >> Okay, so if that happens, what will happen is this.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:29.300]   We will start treating broadband as a scarce resource and we will get companies innovating
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:36.420]   around it instead of on it. And you'll see this with Google investments in 5G. You see it with
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:44.660]   companies like Starry trying to do millimeter wave home delivery. If you talk to Dane, I'm sure he'll
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:50.420]   start thinking about ways. >> It's not ideal. I mean, we have a system that's public, it's free,
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:56.820]   it's open. But you're right. I mean, that's what technology does. It routes around the damage.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:02.180]   >> So, but what would it look like? Would it be a second tier internet? Would it be another,
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:08.340]   a different internet? >> No, I mean, right now we've got fixed wireless is kind of a huge option.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:14.500]   So people are looking at like millimeter wave spectrum. You're going to have lots of little
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:19.460]   small cells in dense areas. It's going to screw over the rural people as always happens.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:27.300]   And you'll have these alternate ISPs and they won't be crappy internet. So, yeah.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.380]   >> So a couple of things to watch for. First of all, battle for the net.com.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:37.540]   Contact your member of Congress. This has been very effective with SOPA. It was very
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.100]   effective in getting the title to regulation. >> Putting it was very effective. Tom Wheeler
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:48.820]   resisted that until he received millions of comments saying, do it. And we were very active
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:54.740]   in that campaign. So we know we can we can affect this. Take advantage of the battle for the net.com.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:00.980]   Then watch what Congress does because if Pi gets his vote, he probably will in one week.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.700]   Then the next step is for Congress to step in. And that's why you have to stay in touch with
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:12.740]   Congress. And the other thing to watch for as we point out is people who basically the big ISPs
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:19.780]   are trying to deflect blame for this to the big four, to the big companies, to Google, Amazon,
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:27.780]   Facebook, and say, oh, it's Twitter's fault. It shares fault. And the AgiPai has already been
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:36.500]   saying that. He says that the problem isn't AT&T, Charter and Comcast and Verizon. The problem is
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:43.700]   Twitter. And so watch for that deflection because that isn't even real. It's not as you point out,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:49.860]   it's not germane. It's not even related, Stacey. All right. Have we said everything we want to say
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:56.020]   about that? We'll probably say it again next week and the week after. But please do.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:02.020]   I've been saying it for almost a decade. Please do because we, I mean, it's a personal issue for
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:10.660]   all of us who listen to podcasts, for instance. This podcasting exists because people can create
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.380]   content and distribute it over the internet at very low cost. We don't want to go back to the days
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.660]   where only the rich could afford the radio transmitters and the TV transmitters and the newspapers.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:28.580]   That's not the way it should be. And it's a personal issue for consumers. You would not have ways
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:34.900]   if carriers could charge for that kind of stuff. You would not have dark sky. You would not have
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.460]   so many things if you go back and a lot of people unfortunately don't remember this. But like,
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:45.780]   God, remember carrier app stores? Oh, it was heinous. Oh, that was so horrible. Oh, my God,
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.620]   you're right. You buy apps from the carriers and ringtones that would expire after three months
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.500]   and you have to buy them again. Yeah. So think about that's where your innovation is going to
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.700]   be clogged at. And it's horrible. And I'm not exaggerating this. I mean, look at all the benefits
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:09.540]   that we have gotten from our open internet culture. You cannot and we don't know what's next. And
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.540]   okay, that's all I'm done. And you know, Aaron, you make a point competition would solve this
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.020]   effect. Ben Thompson was trajectory. He changed the headline because the headline was really,
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.940]   you know, inflammatory. Why Ajit Pai is right. That's not really what he was saying. What he
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:31.060]   was saying is if we have competition, then Ajit Pai is right. But we got to be very clear. We
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   don't have competition because of any competitive moves by the FCC at the behest of AT&T and Verizon
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:44.340]   going back years. So that's exactly right. Yeah. There is no competition. 86% of the country has
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.780]   two choices of internet service providers. And they're crap choices because it's cable or DSL.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:56.100]   Right. And DSL is not a choice. Right. Okay. Not anymore. It used to be okay, right? But we've gone
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:03.380]   beyond that. I mean, the difference it's a, you know, 20 X difference in throughput between
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:09.540]   what I can get from DSL, what I can get from cable. And you know, I think you're right. I mean,
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.700]   the wireless option may be the best one going forward because at least then you don't have to
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.300]   worry about, you know, access rights and things like that. You just have to worry about where you
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:22.020]   can put the towers. But watch out for another thing to watch out for because these companies
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.700]   understand that they'll be competition. Then from other, you know, new arenas is, you know,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.660]   you squeeze in one area, pops out in another. And already part of this is, oh, and by the way,
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:36.340]   no municipal Wi-Fi. No, no states can do their own Wi-Fi thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.380]   and no states capacity net neutrality bills. No, no, no, no, no. So this is really a grab
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:47.940]   by Comcast Verizon AT&T. They're really grabbing and saying and holding on tight. And they don't
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:53.460]   want anybody else to give them an end around. So yeah, there are great technologies possible out
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.340]   there. But these companies are not stupid and they're, they know exactly where the threats are
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:05.220]   coming from. And since they have a tame Congress and a pet FCC, they're going to use those tools.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.980]   And we have to stop them. We really do.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.220]   Yep.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:15.620]   Let's see. The Chrome store is no longer going to offer apps.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:24.660]   Anybody have any idea what's going on? I think Google has said this before, but they're
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:30.340]   actually doing it now. They're shutting down the apps section. Progressive web apps are the future.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:37.460]   And Google's all behind this, but interestingly so is Microsoft. We've talked a lot about PWA,
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:44.820]   Progressive Web Apps on Windows Weekly. And until you or someone else tells me it's a bad idea,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.540]   I think this is a very good idea. The idea of a progressive web app is it starts as a web page.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:56.340]   But it's not exactly the, you know, the web apps of the early iPhone. It's, it starts as a web page.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.460]   But when you go to that web page on your mobile or your desktop, it downloads assets which can
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:07.460]   then be run offline using something called service workers that are running on the desktop or running
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:14.580]   on the phone. So in effect, websites become apps. They use less bandwidth. They can run locally.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:22.340]   They can run offline. And that's what Google is saying. Use Progressive Web Apps, not Chrome apps.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.540]   Agree? Disagree thoughts?
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.500]   What happens with like,
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:37.220]   what happens with the files after you're done using them? Like if every website you go to on
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.180]   your phone gets stored someplace, like, so what's the caching and cleansing kind of process?
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:50.660]   Um, that's an interesting question. There must be a timeout for the resources at some point,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:57.060]   you know, just as cookies expire, you know, after 90 days or 60 days of disuse, you actually
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.380]   are starting to see that both on iOS and Android. They're both operating systems are looking for
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:06.180]   unused apps and moving them off the phone. And I think that's probably the first step towards that.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:11.220]   That's a good question. The service workers are persistent. And the idea is that these apps are
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.940]   somewhat persistent because if you go, you know, if you, for instance, Facebook, imagine Facebook,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.780]   you don't have a Facebook app anymore. You just use your browser to go to Facebook,
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.100]   but Facebook then downloads the assets and make it effectively and ask.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.380]   So I love it for all the common times. The reason I ask these questions is because there's so many,
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.500]   like, you know, every time you go to a restaurant, they're like, Hey, you want our app? And you're
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:39.220]   like, no, or you go to a certain website. So I'm thinking more the one off or two off kind of cases
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:44.740]   and what that because everybody in with then the other question tied to that would be what permissions
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:49.700]   would you automatically end up granting these? Because like everybody wants your information,
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:55.620]   you don't actually have to give it to them today, which is nice. Would you automatically give away
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:01.300]   location if you've accepted and bought into this progressive web app? I think there'd be a permission
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.180]   structure that you would off that you would it even works now with websites. Websites will say,
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.420]   you know, your browser will say this website wants location information when you'd like to
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.660]   grant it. I think all of those things will continue. And but the service workers will
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.380]   allow things like access to the camera access to the GPS access to physical hardware. That's
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.540]   what those service workers are there for. I like this idea. It's basically their HTML5.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:31.620]   If you use react JS, for instance, that's a commonly used framework for these progressive
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.380]   web apps, Google has a whole getting started with progressive web apps page for developers,
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:43.060]   where you write your first app, which I think is a weather app. So Google says this, this is for us.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.540]   Now of course, Google changes his mind regularly. The thing that encourages me is that it's not
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:52.260]   just Google. In this case, Microsoft's doing the same thing. Google says this is for us the replacement
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:00.740]   for Chrome apps, because it'll run on desktop. It'll run on a mobile. It's a universal thing. It'll
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.820]   run on iOS and Android. It's a cross-platform. That would be great for developers.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.420]   That's the cool thing. Yeah, exactly. I look at this from a developer standpoint. I mean,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.500]   anytime I'm not a huge, I do this as a hobbyist, right? So but anytime I can write a web app versus
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.620]   a discrete app for a particular platform, I'll do it because that way I know I can access that
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:25.140]   information from anywhere. And so I think this is a push in the right direction. And also, I mean,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:32.660]   who uses those Chrome apps? I mean, I was a believer in it when they first came out. I was like,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.020]   Oh, this is cool. This is cool. I can play this game. But anymore.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:41.060]   There's a few utilities. My Synology NAS has a note app that I've replaced,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.340]   ever note with. And I can't. I'll give you actually a really good example that probably a lot of
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:51.540]   people use is Hangouts. Hangouts is now persistent. You can close Chrome and Hangouts will continue to
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:56.260]   run. That's the text messaging. And since that's what my text message is, it gives me a desktop
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.900]   and mobile version of text messaging. But there's no reason that couldn't be a PWA.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.180]   And by the way, Apple is also supporting this. This is really good news. And you see Microsoft,
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.900]   Apple and Google all behind it, that's encouraging. So Apple is saying we're going to build this
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.860]   into Safari as well. Okay, well, that makes me feel a little bit better about privacy and
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:21.060]   permissions information kind of getting out there. Because I think you're optimistic to assume that
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:26.420]   that will be taken care of. I think we always have to ask. No, you're right. You're right.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:32.180]   But I think, you know, certainly at least Apple, you know, is really very.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.900]   Ever assumed the as a journalist. They're really secure, aren't they? Especially with their
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.260]   roof. That's for it's boy. Yeah, actually, we're going to do a whole security now. Steve,
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.660]   Steve didn't have time to do it for this week, but next Tuesday, the entire show will be devoted
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:55.780]   to the rapidly shrinking security platform of iOS. iOS was for a while, like the gold standard
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:04.820]   for security. But probably mostly because users are having trouble. Apple has decided to favor data
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:10.180]   persistence and reliability over security. You know, people were losing their photos because
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:15.220]   they couldn't unlock their phone. And so Apple has said, maybe we went a little too far on that.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.820]   So we're going to talk actually about that in the impacts of that next Tuesday.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:25.380]   So why build this is Google's propog, I mean, website developers.google.com. Why build a
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.100]   progressive web app worthy of being on the home screen? That's one thing. You know, web apps were
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   always a second class citizen to standalone apps. They weren't quite as good as fast. They didn't,
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.220]   the user interface wasn't. But the idea here and boy, we've seen this, the industry go through
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:46.180]   this time and time again is, Oh, no, these will be first class citizens worthy of being on the home
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:51.780]   screen works reliably, no matter what the network conditions. That's actually pretty important,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:59.300]   not not just for here, but for in the developing world. So to lower the amount of data required,
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:04.500]   just to do it, increased engagement. And that's what you were talking about, Stacey. You know,
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.620]   you go to the target webpage, well, suddenly you have a target app on your on your phone.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:15.860]   Yeah, I don't want that to be clear. That's not an advantage in my world.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:21.700]   Well, but I think a lot of users might, I'll give you a more better example of the open table
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.300]   instead of installing and you want to make a reservation in a restaurant, you can do it on
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.100]   the open table website, or you can install an open table app. And if you ask Google Assistant
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.780]   to make a reservation for you, and remember, Google's been touting this since Google I
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:39.060]   out a year ago, you make a reservation with Google Assistant, it was going to get a little bit of
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.540]   open table onto your phone, download it. And then it was going to say, I did this without the
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:49.220]   open table, would you like the app? Well, this would be much more seamless. It would just in effect
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.580]   give you an app for open table. But you're right, I want to know about persistence. How long does
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:59.540]   that last? Am I still going to have 5000 apps on my phone? Both both persistence and data sharing
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:06.420]   and permissions. Absolutely. Because like, I can see like open table might really want my location
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:11.460]   all the time. But I don't see a reason to give open table that information.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:16.500]   No, absolutely not. So well, there's, but there's also a different kind of persistency,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:21.940]   which is persistence across devices, which that would be great, right? If I could open up
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:27.620]   something on my laptop, one of these apps, and then go to that page and I'm halfway through
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:32.260]   filling out a form or something, and I got to go, I got to run a busy. So I get on the bar,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.060]   and I can then pull up the same thing on my phone and continue filling out that form. That's a huge
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:42.340]   time saver. So I don't know if these PWAs will help with that problem or not. But I run into this
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.860]   all the time where I'm halfway through completing a task and I've got to run. And then I've got to
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:52.820]   start all over from the beginning again. It's so frustrating. The other thing that this other side
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:58.980]   effect of this is, and this might be something Google wants, it starts to disintermediate the
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:04.260]   app store. You don't need to go to the app store anymore. You just go to the website.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:10.660]   And that's probably better for Google than Apple. Apple's app store is a massive revenue
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:17.940]   generator for Apple. Tim Cook was just saying that in China, what was the number?
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:25.780]   Let me just look it up real quickly. The amount of money that Google made in China
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:35.860]   was billions, 17 billion dollars. That's a quarter of the global app store earnings
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.820]   over how long it can have been the very long. It's just in one year.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:48.020]   Total revenue throughout the store going to developers, remember, is 70 billion.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:55.780]   But that means 30 billion for Apple. So the app store is a cash cow for Apple. And this would
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.060]   kind of change things. Furthermore, if you're Amazon, you hate the app store because
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.460]   you can have a Kindle app there. But if you sell books to the Kindle app, Apple takes a 30%
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:12.340]   chunk. If you do it in the app store, in the progressive web apps, it's just a website.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.540]   I have a feeling Apple doesn't have quite the death grip on your revenue that they would otherwise.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:22.020]   Does that mean if I'm running the progressive web app, I can access YouTube on
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:29.780]   some devices? No, no, let's talk about that. That's really frustrating.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.900]   So we and by the way, it's personally frustrating because we tell people all the time, if you want to,
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.540]   if you have an Echo show, it's not a huge number of people I would imagine. But I have several.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:44.580]   I love the Echo show. It's the Echo with a seven inch screen on it. You can say,
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:52.180]   Echo watch twig on YouTube. Now, they that was when it first came out. It was nice. It was a full
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:59.140]   screen experience. That Google killed that. Then it came back last week. And now Google says, no,
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:06.420]   it's Amazon's fault. They're there. It's not our app. It's their app. And we don't do it that way.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:13.380]   And Amazon hasn't agreed to our terms. So we're killing YouTube access on the Amazon Echo.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:18.420]   Furthermore, on January 1st on the fire, on the fire TV.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:27.140]   And this also remember is because Amazon won't sell Google products on the Amazon's won't sell
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:33.380]   the Google home on the Amazon store, right? Or does it sell nests? I think it still sells nests.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:38.580]   Or it did. No, it's in fact, when I think when Amazon released a camera of its own,
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.580]   they let me see. Oh, yeah. I think I remember them pulling the nest.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:48.500]   No, they do. In fact, Amazon's choice. The nest cam indoor security camera works with an Echo.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.780]   So they do still sell all the nest stuff. But I don't think.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.820]   Well, maybe if alphabet spins a nest back into the Google Pixel hardware division,
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.500]   that will change. If I search for Google home on Amazon, look what shows up.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:08.180]   The Echo dot. Well, and they are next on this. Yeah. Same thing with Chromecast.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.660]   So I understand Google and Amazon are at each other. I think this is dumb of Amazon. That's
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.460]   not because it's the show is this week at Google. But I think it's if you want to be retailer to
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:24.100]   the world, you can't be. This is an net neutrality issue for retail. You can't pick it and choose.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.660]   Don't call it that. Well, it is. No, it is not. It is. No, it's not a
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.940]   neutrality, but it's the same idea that a retailer should not discriminate against products because
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.500]   they compete with the retailers products. Right? No, no, the concept of net neutrality is that we
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:46.580]   view the internet and access to it as a basic right or as a as a public utility.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.540]   Amazon is not a public utility. So that's right. So let's so stop it, Leo. You're playing right
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:56.340]   into their hands. I'm shaking my finger. Okay, but there's something wrong with a retailer that
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:02.900]   doesn't sell products that compete with its own products. Like if if a whole foods didn't sell
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.540]   Ragu pasta sauce, which they wouldn't anyway, but if they did, but just as an example,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.780]   because they've got their 365 brand pasta sauce, wouldn't that's why that's why the
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.220]   brands, the grocery store brands, what is it called when you don't have a brand?
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:21.700]   Thank you. The generics are such a issue. And that's why actually a lot of companies
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:26.340]   don't let Trader Joe's. They don't let Trader Joe's make their stuff and put their stuff in
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.260]   Trader Joe's. Right. So there's this is a dynamic that plays out outside of the time.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:36.660]   It's not unusual. Okay. Okay. What's I feel like it's not if Amazon tends to be customer centric,
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.620]   not including stuff the customer wants worse, surfacing their own product when you search for
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:45.300]   something you want. Right. That's just I mean, and also if you look at like,
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:53.140]   if your core business is getting eyeballs onto your property, then this really hurts. I've long
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:59.300]   been frustrated with Amazon video because I can't cast it to my Chromecast for my device,
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:03.220]   unless I cast my whole screen and even then sometimes it blocks out the video.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:09.140]   And so I've stopped using it. So Amazon wake up. I'm not looking at your properties anymore.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.620]   I'm not going to buy a video that might pop up in an ad or something like that because I'm not
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:18.740]   using your thing because I can't watch it. It's it's stupid. It's ridiculous. But it is.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.940]   We know that this is Amazon versus Google. I don't know because Amazon now is.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.980]   We're making an assumption again. It could be could be Google. Well, we know Google yanked
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:35.140]   YouTube from Amazon's. Right. But we also know that Google has Google not putting its products
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:40.580]   on Amazon. Yeah. Like maybe Google said, I don't want to sell the home there. Apple doesn't sell
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:46.660]   their stuff on Amazon. I can't imagine that. I don't know. I'm just, you know, we're.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:52.740]   Right. We shouldn't know. We don't know. You're right. As usual, Stacey is the voice of wisdom.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   We get all excited. Stacey slaps us down. That's okay. I mean, I think it's totally crappy.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:03.140]   I'm not I'm not against. I mean, as a consumer, I'm like, guys, get your crap together. Yeah.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:09.460]   I'm sick of this. Sick of it. But you don't have to buy stuff at Amazon.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:15.140]   You could there are other places to buy stuff. I might point out. But as a prime member,
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.620]   I prefer to buy it Amazon. I buy every I mean, I buy my Apple gear there. I'd buy my Google home
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.340]   there if I could and Lincoln. Our chat room says I use my fire stick almost exclusively to watch
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:30.020]   YouTube videos. I'm watching Twig on it right now. This royally sucks. My fire stick is now
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.140]   pretty much worthless to me. Yeah. If you bought an Amazon TV device to watch YouTube on,
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:40.820]   see, I think that's going to bite them because I think that's certainly a lot of people. I know
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:46.340]   YouTube is their television and they and they and they watch it on their Chromecast or they watch
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:52.020]   it on their Apple TV or they watch it on their Roku. If it's not on the fire TV, that's that's
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:57.700]   bad for Amazon. In fact, I don't know whether it was Apple or Amazon that was keeping the Amazon
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.980]   prime video off of the Apple TV. But as I said today, it finally emerges.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:09.540]   Scooter X points out that it is Amazon thwarting Google's ability to put their stuff in their
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:15.060]   stores. It is. He put it. Yeah. He said he posted a statement in the chat room from Scooter Knows
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:19.220]   All. We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:23.780]   products and services. But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.540]   Doesn't make prime video available for Google Cast users. And last month,
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:34.020]   stop selling some of Nest's latest products, giving this lack of reciprocity. We are no longer
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:38.740]   supporting YouTube on Echo Show on Fire TV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.620]   these issues soon. Thank you, Scooter X. That's it. That's Google's statement.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:51.700]   And Google pointed out this is in our app. You know, this is Amazon. Anyway, it's bad for
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:56.260]   but again, dinosaurs battle the little people at their feet are the ones getting squished.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:02.180]   And here we are. You know, we love it that people could watch our shows easily with a single.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.700]   You could still listen. But the idea that somebody who had a screen on their on their
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:12.020]   Echo device could watch our shows was really great. Amazon has also pulled the Twitch channel
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:16.900]   from Roku, apparently. What? Another thing.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:22.180]   Roku is like Switzerland. Yeah, that's right. Well, it was Switzerland. Damn it.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:29.060]   There isn't a Twitch app on Apple TV either. Or on Android TV, although there is an app for the
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:39.380]   Nvidia Shield tablet, not Android TV. Huh. So starting today, the official Twitch app for streaming
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.780]   is now a fire TV exclusive. Who owns Twitch, I might add. Amazon.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:50.020]   I guess they're trying to make a YouTube thing. I mean, the truth of it is you can whoever has
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:54.580]   the most audience and power has the most power right now in these sorts of dynamics.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.180]   Of course. Yeah. But the cable.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:04.020]   Yeah, but this is like the cable retrans disagreements that happen all the time. And you know,
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:10.420]   because those travel in part retrans being an issue of public airwaves and access to public
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:20.020]   channels, the FCC gets involved. Because this is at the application layer, this could be an option
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:28.180]   or a thing that gets the FCC or probably the FTC involved saying, Hey, are you guys behaving
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.100]   well? So that might be the impetus to get people to regulate, you know, at the application layer.
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:43.460]   And that'd be very interesting. Yeah. We consumers always end up suffering from this stuff.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:49.380]   Because we want to watch what we want when we want it, when we want it anytime.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.820]   And that was for free. And well, but that's, can I tell you, that's what Twitch does.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:01.620]   We put we put ourselves anywhere anybody wants to watch us. As long as we get to count the viewers
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.100]   and you don't take out our ads and you don't charge people for it, you give it away, you know, it's
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:14.260]   everywhere. And you know, on an airplane in, in it's actually on terrestrial television in some
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.300]   areas, you can watch our shows, because our philosophy is what we make our money from the
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:24.420]   advertising. So the more eyeballs, the better. But that's because we're unaffiliated, you know,
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:32.740]   if Amazon bought us and Jeff, I just want to say for everything I might have said about Amazon,
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:39.860]   I would be acceptable to that, amenable to that idea. But if Amazon bought us, we might have to say,
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:45.620]   Oh, yeah, you can't, you can't watch us on a Roku. I wouldn't like that. Now we built, you know,
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.980]   we intentionally, I always said, from day one, we want to be everywhere. People want to see us
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.300]   for free easily, easily accessible. That's what makes podcasts work.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.460]   That's the content. Yeah, that's the content providers,
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.860]   Mantra as the distribution platform you want exclusivity for something. So people come to you.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:07.700]   I know how's the card? And the internet was supposed to eliminate the middleman as the
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:13.540]   distributor, but it hasn't, because, you know, you still have to still have to need software,
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:19.860]   you need an OS, you need something, depending on the platforms. We're in the platform era,
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:23.220]   really. It's actually, we never lost stop being it was Microsoft in the 90s.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.820]   Now there's a little more competition. By the way, I'm very excited that
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:34.820]   Robin, what's her name is going to get to be the star of House of Cards, finally.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.900]   Did you see that? They're going to, they're going to see that.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.580]   Yeah. So the best thing about that. Robin Wright is fabulous.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:46.660]   And it always bugged me a little bit. And they were making Kevin Spacey's character
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:52.500]   wimpy or weirder. They're good. So they're throwing out everything they shot.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:59.220]   And they're going to do a new eight, eight episode arc with Robin Wright as a star,
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.940]   as it should be. And then that'll wrap it up.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   Yeah. Now, and then the story is the Doug Stamper,
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:13.860]   who is the weasily chief of staff, is going to get the spin off the Doug Stamper show.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.900]   Really? Let's just have all Robin Hall, Robin Wright.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.980]   You know, I don't need anybody else in that show.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:26.580]   She is amazing. Although part of what was amazing was the interplay between her and Spacey.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:35.380]   I think she could develop. I mean, because she is she is competent. She is evil in a way that
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:40.660]   women are never allowed to be. And she is just like, you root for her though, because she is
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:44.500]   powerful. And I'm like, I would love to see her dynamic develop with anyone.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.660]   And especially because I did get a little soapy. But you know what?
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.300]   No, it's not a slopie. I think Christopher Plummer is available.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:01:00.020]   That's kind of an in joke. All right. Because, okay, I'll explain it. Christopher Plummer
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:06.980]   in 10 days, they reshot the movie, all the money in the world that they took Kevin Spacey's character
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.780]   out. And they reshot it with Christopher Plummer in 10 days and the movie's coming out.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:18.820]   That's crazy. Crazy. And now Christopher Plummer is going to play all the male leads in Hollywood
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:26.420]   from now on. He's the only the only one left who can act in these movies. Time magazine,
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:32.100]   Person of the Year, Women of the Year. What do they call it? The truth tellers, the speak uppers,
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:40.820]   the talker abouters. It's not the president. Did you see this? Thank goodness. I know.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.860]   Did the Me Too, please? I saw the Me Too. Yeah, the Me Too. No, they have a name for it.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.780]   Let me see if I could find it. They well played the silence breakers. That's what it is. Silence
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:56.260]   breakers. Well played Time magazine. Silence breakers. Oh, there's a guy in there. Look at that.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:01.220]   Terry Crews. Yeah. So that I think is, I think, you know what? I think that's accurate, actually.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:07.220]   They certainly that has made a massive impact on not just politics, but culture at large and
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.380]   Silicon Valley too. And they managed to still get Taylor Swift on the cover.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:18.820]   By the way, do you think Time magazine now that it's about to be owned by Meredith? Do you think
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.300]   that? What do you think? Guess who's going to be the person in the year next year?
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:28.660]   Just a wild shot. Maybe Adjut Pie. Do you think time will still exist as a magazine?
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:37.780]   I wonder because Meredith is such a lifestyle brand. If Time and Fortune and those guys still
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.140]   exist. I don't know. Why would you spend a lot of money to buy it if you didn't want to
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:51.860]   continue to publish it? Steve Case has created a new fund called The Rise of the Rest.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:58.580]   I would call it the flyover fund. Didn't he do this like five or six years? I swear to God.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:03.780]   Steve Case has been traveling middle America for a decade. Yeah. He's been he's raised money from
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:11.060]   Bezos and a lot of other people to fund startups. Bezos, Eric Schmidt, Starbucks chairman Howard
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:18.660]   Schulz, Torrey Birch, the fashion designer, the Henry Kraviss of KK and R, all at Michael Milken,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:27.220]   John Doar, The Waltons, The Cokes, The Prittskers, Sean Parker, Ted Leonces,
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.100]   they're all putting money into this fund to foster startups in middle America.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:43.220]   I'm almost 100% sure he's done this before. Yeah. And it seems like that's not really
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:51.060]   there's lots of reasons why startups happen and where they happen. But just because you decide that
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.780]   geopolitically you feel like it should be somewhere it doesn't make that happen. Even if you throw a
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:02.100]   lot of money at it. You know what I'd like to see him do throw money at makerspaces.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:09.300]   Put that money where tech shop going under. Makeerspaces are incredibly important right now.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.460]   Tech shop was the first for profit maker. Most makerspaces are like yours,
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:17.860]   a binesher maker space, a nonprofit, but tech space they thought we could make this a business.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.820]   Was that did that go under just because you couldn't or because there were some structural
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.460]   problems? Well, I think it was a little bit of both. I think there were some structural problems.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.060]   They put out a press release. Sorry, I have the link to it right handy, but they put out a
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:36.260]   press release kind of explaining what publicly why they went under. But it was a funding problem.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:43.220]   But look, I mean, if you look at what tech shop I think was started at like $125 a month or
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:49.700]   something and we start at $50 a month. And you know, yeah, we're scraping by, but we're doing it.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.940]   It is possible to do. But once you start adding in the layers of bureaucracy and you have to
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:59.780]   start paying a lot of people, it does become quite expensive to run even a community based
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:05.940]   maker space. It's not easy. Tech shop said that they weren't they were getting memberships,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:11.380]   but the growth was slow and they couldn't keep people as members. And that's what funds it,
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:16.100]   right? You have to buy it. And I suspect the model was somewhat like gym memberships where
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.740]   people ask relationally will buy a membership, but maybe not use it a lot. There are some have
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.380]   very heavy users. And there's some people who effectively subsidize it by not using it.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.180]   Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's what we're doing right now is we're looking for,
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.740]   you know, people to become sponsors. We're looking to reach out to the to the business community and
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:38.580]   say, Hey, look, this is an incubator for you guys too, because people come in, they learn about
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.620]   stuff. And then that gives you skilled work, skilled laborers to hire that can come in and
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:49.060]   work on your projects for your business. So we're trying to get the business community involved
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.740]   now to sponsor this as well as a growth opportunity for skilled laborers.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:59.380]   I was being kind of facetious, but honestly, that's really invest in that in the flyover states.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:03.700]   And you're investing in the future. You're investing in a whole generation of people who
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:09.780]   will have the skills, the knowledge, you know, Jack Dorsey invented square in a maker space.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:14.100]   He built the prototype, did the whole thing in a maker space. That's what you, not the Jack Dorsey
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:21.140]   was a 12 year old with with a dream. But so you're doing a fundraiser, a crowd, a crowd,
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:27.140]   fundraiser. We got to get some money in here though. Yeah, we actually started this about four
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:31.220]   months ago. And we put a hold on it, because a couple of weeks after we started this,
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:35.620]   the hurricane season started, and then the fire started. And we said, we are not going to,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.420]   we want people to donate to those causes. So we actually put this on hold for a while. And we're
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:45.860]   just coming back to it now to try to, to try to finish this off, especially with the end of the
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:50.100]   year. People like to contribute at least for now to get a tax donation. We'll see what happens.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:56.100]   But this year, you can still get a nice deduction on your taxes for contributing. So yeah, we're
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.740]   trying to round this off. We've had a lot of growth, which is great, but it's slow growth. People
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:04.980]   don't still don't know what a maker space is. They don't know what they can do there. And getting
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.420]   them in the door and showing them what they can do, it's like the light bulb goes on. They're like,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:14.980]   wow, this is incredible. But just getting them over that threshold is tricky. So it's good growth,
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.860]   but it's slow growth. And we need a little bit of funding to help keep us going.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:23.620]   Well, I'm going to just kick in a little bit here for that. I think we should be a corporate
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:29.220]   sponsor, don't you? Oh, thank you, Leo. Appreciate that. That's great. Let me throw in on that,
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:35.780]   because yeah, and I want this to continue. And I do think it's good. It's good for us.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:43.540]   It makes geeks. Yeah, it's a geek maker. Exactly. Yeah, it's a geek factory. It's a geek factory.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:50.420]   So let's see. Yeah, I'm going to put it on. Please enter all required. Oh, I got to do this. I'll do
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:55.860]   the I don't want to put my credit card on on the air as I have done in the past. More than once.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.820]   I cancel credit cards a lot these days. So I'll do that when we get off the air. But I think that's
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:09.620]   really well worth doing. It's on Indiegogo, search Indiegogo for Benesha, B-E-N-E-C-I-A makerspace.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:15.700]   Yeah, we're using their, they acquired a company called Generosity. So we took a chance and used
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:21.220]   them. It's a subsidiary now, the Indiegogo. So yeah, just search for Generosity, Benesha makerspace.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:27.300]   It should pop right up. There it is. And there's a nice picture of Aaron in a Twitch
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.540]   t-shirt, which I like. Oh, it's like you're already sponsoring it. Yeah, we already are.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:35.860]   So that was the, I think that was on, well, yeah, there was on the new screensavers when we
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:43.300]   talked about how to build a makerspace. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. It was great. Well, you got my corporate
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:50.180]   contribution right there. We'll put it on. That'll be your holiday gift. That's awesome.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.940]   Actually, we already sent you the food. Yeah, I know. You said some cash. You said your kids ate it all.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:01.220]   Gift. Oh my word. Yeah, the kids just ripped into it. It's like, I opened it up, I set it on the
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:05.380]   thing. I'm like, I'm going to leave this here to show my wife, right? So I come back in an hour
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.020]   later and all the little packages are open and all the food's gone. The teenagers. Yeah.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.900]   What are you going to do? Stacy, did you get yours? I did. Thank you very much. You're welcome.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.460]   We, we did not, there's only three people in my house. So none of them are teenagers.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:26.580]   So it lasted a long time. You know, my, my husband did come. He's like, I think most of this is
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:32.180]   packaging and not chocolate. Oh, it's a gift basket. That's how it works.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:39.220]   It has to be packaged. He's like, he just, okay, you know what, next year, I'm sending you a basket
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:43.380]   with just a ton of chocolate in it. No packaging. Just a brick and chocolate. I mean, you need to
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.140]   be wrapped. Do you like your deli? Because that's the local chocolate. We'll send you, actually,
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:52.980]   you know what we'll send you to show TCHO, which is the silicon vet, the chocolate of Silicon Valley.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:10:00.580]   Oh, wow. Yeah. It's really good. This was delicious. We all appreciated apparently some of us,
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:04.740]   more than others. We're just, some of us wanted more and we're bitterly disappointed.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.820]   Oh God, I'm going to send you another one.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:16.020]   I just thought it was kind of cute. Like a 40 year old man reduced to like a kid, you know,
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:22.980]   one more chocolate. He's still frustrated over those toys that you get that are all
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.740]   twist tied in the back and you can't get them out. Yeah. Exactly. Frustration free
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:30.900]   gift baskets. Okay. That's the next next time. That's the next time.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:36.500]   Our show today, but what go ahead? You get, you know, you got, no, no, I don't have to go to an ad
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:42.100]   yet. Go ahead. I was just saying, I do think it's a big opportunity miss with Amazon buying whole
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:48.420]   foods that they have not brought gift baskets, like high quality gift baskets to, like,
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:53.140]   I wanted to do that for Christmas this year, but no, actually Aaron, you are breaking my,
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:11:02.260]   within less than 24 hour embargo on crowdfunding because I've been so burned by crowdfunding.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:07.540]   Last night, Lisa and I said to each other, okay, no more, right? Right. No more.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.740]   But you're breaking it because that's different because I don't expect anything from that.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.460]   That's just how I'm sorry, Leah. I didn't mean to. No, no, no, send you down that road.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:26.420]   But I finally sent an email to Gebo because I'm number 382. I sent them $500 in 2014
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:32.820]   for the robot that looks around, right? What a, so I finally said, I'm a note. They said, oh,
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:37.460]   you must have received our email in October asking your address. They have my address,
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.140]   but it's been so long. It was the old studio. So it's probably good. So,
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:46.900]   so I said on the new address, they said, your Gebo's on the way. So maybe by next week,
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:52.020]   Stacy, you'll have, well, get rid of Jeff and we'll have a little friend join the show,
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:59.780]   a little G. Oh, cool. If I can be replaced by a robot or Jeff can be replaced by a robot.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.620]   No, I would never do it. You can't. You can't. You can't. But I am curious. The Gebo,
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:10.660]   the thing that got me to send the money completely on spec is it Cynthia Brazil,
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:17.620]   who was a very good roboticist out of MIT. And so I thought that was a pretty good
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:25.060]   ancestry. We'll see. We'll find out. It's been so long though, because she announced it before
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:32.180]   the Amazon Echo came out. Times have changed. At least you're getting it. I mean, I know all the
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:38.900]   things that the Echo does. It's very disappointing. Do you have a Gebo? I don't. But one of my friends
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:45.620]   does. Yeah. Oh, you're trying not to let me down easy. Okay. I'm sorry.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:53.380]   29. Maybe it's cute though. It's very cute. Stacy has a long tradition.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.180]   Shoeing down. I'm just pooping on everything.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:03.060]   Maybe that should be the title of the show. Yeah. Stacy's pooping on everything.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.140]   Last time. There we go. Last time when I bought it, was it a Nest IQ? She said, "You doofus!"
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:11.780]   But she was right because she wanted me to buy this thing. I'm back here at the lighthouse and
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.580]   she was right because they're a sponsor now. They weren't at the time. Our show today brought to
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:22.340]   you by Captera. You need software solutions for your business. The last thing you want to do is
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:32.660]   Google how to dog groomer business software. That's a really bad idea. Or yoga studio software.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:39.060]   Or, well, I can go on and on. You want to go to Captera, a free directory of over 500 categories
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:46.660]   of business software. I love going down the list of Captera businesses because who knew?
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:54.580]   Who knew there were businesses? I mean, A/B testing software, accounting software, advocacy software,
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:14:00.020]   anti-spam software, apparel management software, applicant tracking software,
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:06.260]   archiving, art gallery, asset tracking, assisted living, auction, audit, augmented reality. And
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:13.140]   that's just a fraction of the A's alone. Let's go all the way to the end. Let's say you have,
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:20.900]   what's the last one in the list? Let's say you have a yoga studio. There's nothing with Z.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:26.340]   You know, I have a yoga studio. I need software. So you click yoga studio software.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:32.580]   And who knew there's a ton of a mind body, Vogaro, one fit stop, Zen Planner at Glowfox,
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.100]   Wellness Living Frederick, Mark, there's a ton of them. Well, that's a start. That's better than
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:43.140]   Google. But now watch, we can refine it. Say, yeah, you know what? I only want four stars.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.900]   Because by the way, these stars come from actual users like you, real reviews from real users.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:54.260]   You can narrow it down and say, this has got to be web installed. It's got to handle 10 to 50 people.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:00.340]   Let's see class scheduling. Yes, in member management. Yes, online payments. Yes. Now,
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.180]   those are the criteria. We've narrowed it down. There's now there's 18 products.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:08.820]   Let's try. Let's see. I like, let's try this. Oh, you can click it and you can find out more about it.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:14.180]   Or you can add it to the compare. Let's check that box. Let's do that first. Wellness Living. I'm
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:19.060]   just going to don't don't take it personally, folks. If I don't click your software, there's studio
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:25.380]   director. All right. Now we're going to do a comparison. And boy, this is talk about useful.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:29.700]   This is all free. I didn't have to sign up. I didn't have to do anything but go to capterra.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:38.580]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twig. You see if it's got mobile. You see what's got, how much it costs.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:44.100]   You can see if it's got a free trial. There's everything. You got the website link. And then
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:51.460]   you have reviews from actual people. Hundreds of thousands of reviews are on the capterra site.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.020]   And they're very careful. They really manage these reviews.

[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:41.140]   and you a lot of anxiety. Sometimes it's affected often happens around this time of year.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.260]   You got holiday shopping. You guys stop doing your buses.
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:51.380]   Smithers, find me some new software. But boss, I want to go home. I don't care. Smithers.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.420]   Capterra.com slash twig. You'll get home on time.
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:17:03.620]   Oh, let's see. Some people are getting Google Home minis that are crashing and rebooting
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.100]   when you listen to certain songs at high volume.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.140]   What?
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:21.540]   Okay. Here's some songs. "Royals by Lord." "Jaden Smith's Icon."
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:29.620]   If you turn it up to 100%, it will crash, at least according to Reddit.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:36.020]   All right. Reddit subreddit, Google Home subreddit. Actually, people are both Reddit
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:41.060]   and the Google products forms are complaining. You think it's overheat? It could be overheating.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:47.300]   I have to say, Google's had some hardware issues with this mini. Do you have either of you have one yet?
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:51.140]   I have one. I'm giving it away as a white elephant gift though.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.940]   Oh, really? Yeah. You don't like it. I do not. Are you all in on the Echo?
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.660]   No, I like my Google Home. I actually, we put it on the mini list.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:06.820]   It doesn't hear you well. It's a pain to use tapping the thing is just irritating.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:16.420]   Maybe you want the Google Home Maxi. According to Best Buy, well, you never know, by the way,
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:21.460]   when you see these listings. But Best Buy had a listing, a placeholder that said December 11th,
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:27.460]   just a few days a week from today, right? Or a little less. Google did say they'll get it out
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.260]   this year, so that means they only have a few more weeks. So the Maxi is not the Maxi. It's the Max.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:41.780]   I'm going to call it the Maxi because it's mini, MIDI and Maxi. The Maxi is the one with the speaker,
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:48.340]   the big speaker. It understands its environment. Self-calibrating speaker.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:55.620]   $400 self-calibrating speaker. So expensive. Have you guys actually heard the sound coming out?
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:02.660]   I haven't heard why I'm a person yet. Do anybody that we know hear it? I don't know.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:15.300]   Google could be forced to pay 5 million UK iPhone users, oddly enough. 2.7 billion pounds in compensation
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:24.580]   because it's according to the consumer watchdog group. Actually, no, it's a class action,
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:32.980]   a consumer campaign called Google UOS. They alleged that Google was unlawfully harvesting
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:41.460]   the browser histories of iPhone users without their permission. Google UOS. I feel a little
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.180]   bad for Google. It's like your rich uncle. Everybody comes to him with their handout.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:52.660]   Although at least one state is probing Google's secret tracking of Android users.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:20:00.260]   The Connecticut Attorney General is always doing that. George Jepsen. Meet George Jepsen.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:06.260]   This is that thing that we talked about where even if you had disabled location services,
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:10.580]   Google would know where you were based on the cell phone towers. Of course, your carrier knows
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:16.580]   that. Carrier keeps that information for quite a while and even hands it over to law enforcement.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:23.700]   By the way, that is the subject of a Supreme Court case that is going to be maybe one of the most
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:35.540]   important cases of the year. We'll find out by spring. Supreme Court is hearing a case about
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:44.900]   whether these pen register warrants are legal. Currently, thanks to a number of court decisions,
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.140]   it's deemed that the location information coming out of your phone
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:58.900]   is not a search because you voluntarily conveyed that information to the phone company.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:09.460]   That is the current precedent. There is a case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear about a
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:19.460]   Radio Shack robbery. The alleged perpetrator was caught because the police were able to get his
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:28.580]   phone records and were able to tie him using the phone records, tie him to the robberies. He was
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:35.220]   near the robberies in many cases. This is going to be a fairly important decision for people who
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:41.220]   want to make, who want privacy. They did that without a warrant, right?
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:48.180]   Right. It's a pen register. That's the key. It's fine if I give my information to my
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.540]   cell phone provider, but that's a... Then they're giving it.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:55.540]   Between me and them, they can't just take the information and give it over to somebody else.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:01.460]   They could give it over to law enforcement. I would say if law enforcement had a warrant to go
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:05.860]   to go get that information, but they can't just say, "Oh, yeah, sure. It's open. It's very...
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.500]   Anybody can go find it." There's got to be some security around that.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:14.660]   Apple, Facebook, and Google have all filed Amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court to
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.620]   bring Fourth Amendment law into the modern era. No, quote, "No constitutional doctrine should
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:24.980]   presume that consumers assume the risk of warrantless government surveillance simply by using
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:29.220]   technologies that are beneficial and increasingly integrated into modern life." Of course,
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:35.780]   Google, Apple, and Facebook have quite a dog in this hunt. We've known that this goes on.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:39.060]   We've known that you didn't... The police did not need a warrant to find your location and
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.100]   to track you. Of course, the cell phone companies keep years of tracking data. In fact, even have
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:51.860]   special portals just for law enforcement where the police, local, federal, anybody can go in,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:56.900]   pay a small fee, a few dollars in most cases, and say, "Well, where was Leo on the night of
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:05.620]   November 29th, 1956?" We will see June by June. The Supreme Court will rule on this. I don't know
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:11.300]   if arguments have... If they've had the argument... I think they had arguments, but I don't know.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:19.460]   That would be... That's the only chance you have to really get a Wednesday. So tomorrow,
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:25.940]   arguments... That's today, rather. Wednesday. No, that was last week. Last Wednesday. Sorry.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:32.740]   I'm laughing because Virgil in the chat room says they could use a potato chip bag to block the
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.580]   track. Maybe that's what we ought to do. Wasn't there a worker who did that? He put his phone in a
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.660]   ruffles bag. It's one of the small ones. Apparently, they have metal and was able to
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:48.740]   skip out on the construction site. His company was... They had built-in tracking software to
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.820]   track whether they were on the job or not. So he puts after lunch, he puts his phone in the chip
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:24:00.180]   bag and goes to a movie. I think that's awesome. But shame on him for not doing his job, I guess,
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.340]   but still. It's pretty funny. So I don't know if you're teenagers still believe in Santa, but
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:09.940]   certainly mind you. And that's why we have the Santa Tracker app from Google on my phone.
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:19.380]   And now you can take Elphis around the world with the Santa Tracker app. Make sure you put it on your
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:27.220]   phone. New activities will pop up between now and Christmas Eve, including an AI drawing game,
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:33.620]   an Elf Dance coding game, and a virtual snowball fight. Google's Santa Tracker.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:39.300]   I put it on my phone. This is a perfect example of what a progressive web app should be.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:43.940]   You should just appear on your phone and then disappear.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:51.620]   Have you guys... I don't know if this is new or not. Have you guys done the Google security
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.580]   checkup? Has that popped up for you guys? Oh, yeah. I get that all the time.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.020]   Yeah. I had not gotten it until the other day. I was like, this is awesome.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.420]   And we encourage people to do it, actually. Yeah.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:03.940]   I mean, because I've forgotten some of these apps. I went through it the other day, and I'd
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:08.020]   forgotten some of the apps that had access to my drive, for example, things like that stuff.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.580]   I had uninstalled years ago, and they still had access.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:15.460]   And you should do that for Twitter, too. Yes, everybody should do it. Yeah.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:22.020]   It's google.com/security. They offer a security checkup, but this will give you all of the
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:28.820]   things and all of the different capabilities. The thing you're talking about is checking which apps
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:37.140]   have your Google account. Yeah. If you just Google security checkup, it should be the first link
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:43.860]   in the list. It's great. Certainly, probably, I don't believe they're required to do this in
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:47.940]   any shape or form. But this popped up for me the other day. And I'm like, who knows to you,
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:52.020]   Google. This is pretty awesome. Yeah. Sorry. Public service announcement for the day.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:58.500]   Let's see. We're going to wrap things up because we have to get out of here in 12 minutes.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:04.100]   So we can get to Mr. Paul Therott and Windows Weekly. We're going to find out about those new
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:10.820]   ARM laptops. Crack Wi-Fi patch coming in December to pixels and next eye.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.860]   That's important. Make sure you get-- I hope you're getting those regular patches,
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:22.020]   monthly patches in the December patch should be out any day now. Or maybe it is out.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:27.540]   I haven't seen it yet, but I should check. Let me check it by Pixel 2.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:32.260]   Wouldn't it have come out yesterday? Don't they always come out on Tuesday now?
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:35.220]   No, that's Windows. Microsoft doesn't have to-- That's Microsoft. Never mind.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:40.740]   I wish Google were that consistent. It isn't, though. It's usually in the first couple of weeks
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:48.260]   of the month, but you never really know system update. Oh, you know, I'm on the 8.1 beta,
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.460]   so I don't know if I will be a good test of that. Yeah, I currently only have the November 5th
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.740]   security patch. Don't you have the December-- That's all I still have. Yeah.
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:05.540]   Just checking to make sure we got everything. Before we run, you guys have any stories you really
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:11.620]   want to get in here? Did you see the virtual cats? Have you bought virtual cats? Are you going to buy
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:18.740]   virtual cats? Yes. No. No. I mean, yes. I had not heard about them, but yes, I will buy them.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:24.980]   Crypto kitties. I think blockchain has gone off the rails.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:34.500]   There is no value to these, but people have already spent a million dollars. The most expensive
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:41.220]   kitty right now is $112,000, just so you know it's speculation. It's like gambling, guys.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:46.420]   People spend a lot of money on gambling. Yeah. Well, it's not even as fun as gambling. You're
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:51.140]   just hoping that you can sell it for a higher price than you buy it for. Some people think that's
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:59.460]   really fun. It's brilliant on the part of the designers because they aren't doing diddly-doo,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:06.260]   and you have to install a Chrome extension for Ethereum called MetaMask.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:13.940]   And then you're using Ethereum, the cryptocurrency Ethereum, to purchase crypto kitties and then auction
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:20.660]   them and sell them. What's fun? I don't think there's anything involved in feeding them or taking
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:27.860]   call to care of them or anything like that. I think it's basically a market for virtual kitties.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:35.700]   I think that we're a little more mature, I would say, age-wise. But I know that my kids love this
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:40.500]   kind of stuff. Every game they play, they always want, it doesn't do anything to help you in the
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:45.460]   game, but they want the latest shing. Oh, it's big on kids, I know. This is not for kids.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:52.980]   This is not for kids for sure. Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, has done a good job in the past
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:57.780]   of stopping ticket buying bots. It was a big problem on Broadway and it's concerts
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:01.860]   where these bots would go out, scoop up all the tickets, and then resell them, scalp them
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:09.380]   for higher prices. Schumer says the bots are back. He passed the Bots Act last year to protect
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:17.220]   games, concerts, and Broadway shows. Now he wants to expand it to toys. Bots can locate the,
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:22.580]   and I'm not surprised given that a lot of commerce is online now, locate the product page
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:30.340]   of a popular toy even before it goes on sale, buy them up, and then resell them to panicked
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:37.540]   parents who just have to have that cabbage patch, or the Furby. Toys itself for 15 bucks are now
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:45.380]   being sold on websites like eBay for as much as $1,000. So Schumer is calling attention to it.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:49.860]   I don't know if he's going to get an act of law. He says we're asking the National Retail
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:54.340]   Federation and the Retail Industry Leaders Association to block the bots. They can,
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:30:01.700]   technologically, and they should be, and I agree. What is the toy this, what is this season's toy?
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:07.940]   They said the Barbie Dreamhouse was doing big, and then these fucker little puppet things,
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:11.780]   fingerlings, maybe? Fingerlings, I think, is what they're called. They're like, they're not
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.740]   potatoes. They're little puppets, finger puppets. Okay, I'm really disappointed and saddened to
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:25.220]   have to report that the Winklevoss twins have taken their $11 million settlement from Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.980]   You saw the movie. You know that they think Suck stole Facebook from them. Maybe he did.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:33.300]   Maybe he didn't. He settled. Apparently, I didn't know this for $11 million. They've invested it in
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:42.660]   Bitcoin, and they are now Bitcoin billionaires. Wow. Because Bitcoin's almost $12,000 now.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:47.540]   Yeah, just sell and change that into real money, or at least sell most of it and change it into real
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:54.820]   money. Diversified. Exactly. But they did say, you know, a few years ago, they were all in on
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:58.340]   Bitcoin, and it turned out to be right, although I don't know how that happened.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:03.460]   And we'll-- That's been crazy lately. It's crazy. $13,000 now?
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:10.900]   Wow, that can't be. Really? This is crazy speculation. Let me look at the Coinbase.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:17.140]   See what the quote-- what's the quote for the current? Is that the place to go to get the--
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:24.100]   What's the best place to get the quote? I like Coinbase. $13,315.71.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:35.300]   Up $6,000, almost half since last month. And 88% growth since last month. And no end in sight.
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:42.820]   And I-- My son has been texting me more and more urgently every day saying, "Dad,
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:48.580]   you got to unlock your wallet. You got to find your wallet." Because I have a Bitcoin wallet somewhere
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:55.860]   with seven coins in it. You really should. $91,000 now. Because if you let it go bust.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.420]   That would be terrible. What are the tax implications of Bitcoin? Oh, IRS wants to know.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:06.260]   If you go to Coinbase, they're asking Coinbase to hand over those records to the IRS. It's taxable
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:12.260]   income. I don't know what the basis is. I didn't buy them. There was-- I know. I don't know what to
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:20.100]   do. I don't want to pay the taxes on that. Chipotle is, I'm sorry to say, revamping its caseo recipe.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:24.500]   Oh, if they were a gift, you would pay a gift tax. But I don't know if it was the value when they
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:30.900]   were gifted or the value now. What's that? The burritos or the Bitcoin? No, caseo.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:38.660]   Taxo value of the caseo. So, Bloomberg confirms Jeff Jarvis's assertion that it's grainy.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.900]   That would be uncooked flour probably, right? So, they are made-- still made without artificial
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:50.660]   ingredients, but now has a creamier texture and a really nice spicy flavor according to
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:57.300]   Chipotle spokesperson Chris Sartel. I have a cute flower in thesis.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:03.060]   Spice it up. Well, to thicken it. Yeah. It's melted cheese. It's supposed to be thick.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:10.180]   I mean, if you're saying I'm not using artificial ingredients because I'm using soybean oil, then
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:15.540]   that is a real ingredient, but it's also not a real ingredient in caseo.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.660]   Well, we don't know what the ingredients are. It's a secret recipe.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:27.220]   I learned today I learned T-I-L that-- you remember that Mozilla had a deal with Yahoo
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:34.740]   for search when Yahoo was sold to Verizon and turned into oath, still the worst name
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:46.020]   in technology today. That Mozilla, the Mozilla Foundation decided to take advantage of an
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.220]   out in their contract on sale if they didn't like the new company they could
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:56.020]   stop using Yahoo and start using Google. But what I learned today was regardless,
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:02.580]   Yahoo has to continue to pay Mozilla $375 million a year through 2019.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.700]   Oh my God, those people sucked at making deals. Guess who?
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:11.540]   Marissa Meyer made that deal. That is such a terrible deal.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:19.940]   Even if you don't use Yahoo. Did that get stuck in? Did they not notice that and do diligence?
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:22.900]   Because that's pretty material. Well, lawsuits are flying.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:30.340]   Oath is suing Mozilla and Mozilla is now countersuing because, well, I'm guessing it's that
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:37.380]   $375 million, that's the problem. Oath at least says you got to use Yahoo.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:44.100]   But Mozilla says, "No, the contract is clear. We had a unilateral right to terminate based on
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:50.980]   a number of factors, including not liking the company that bought Yahoo."
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:56.820]   So back and forth and back and forth and you know how court actions are by the time it's done,
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:03.380]   the $375 was shrink to nothing. We're headed towards, yes, I know we just got our new emojis
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.980]   for 2017. But guess what? As soon as you get the new emojis, you got to start working on the
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:14.100]   next generation. One more step. We finally, I'm so relieved. We got rid of frowny poop face.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:21.540]   This was controversial. There were battles we're told raging on the Unicode Emoji Committee over the
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:29.460]   frowning pile of poo. It's been removed as has the face with letters, okay, as eyes
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:37.860]   and the frowning face with question marks as eyes. All three rejected. But good news,
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:43.860]   you will be able to flip your emojis in 2018. Right to left or left or right. That's always been a
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:48.340]   problem. You know, the flag blowing the wrong way or the train going the wrong way. So now you'll
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.780]   be able to flip them. And they got some new, the new candidates here are here.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:58.340]   Bagels. Is that what that is? Sure. Oh, what is it? Is that a mango?
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:05.060]   Yep. Teddy bear mango party face skateboards, spool of thread, really?
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.540]   Spool of thread. Now these haven't been approved. These are just these are, but they are still in
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:16.340]   the running. There's a swan. Curly Afro here, I guess, and red hair. Redheads finally,
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:20.660]   finally represented in the emoji spectrum. And yeah, I think that's a bagel.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:28.180]   I guess that's a bagel. It's not a donut. Yeah, I mean, they cut it in half, right? Because
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.020]   otherwise you'd think it was a donut. Oh boy, you're smart. And they looks like they toasted it
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.980]   and put butter on it. And now I'm hungry.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:43.780]   Well, let's wrap it up. Let's get your picks and we'll have a final word in a moment I
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:48.660]   showed you today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage. Quick and loans. We love them the best lender in

[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:44.020]   I have two things. One is pretty limited, I feel. And the other thing is old. So,
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:49.940]   but I just discovered it. So maybe you guys don't know about it. So my first thing is for
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:57.860]   Tesla owners only. Sorry. But there's the my Tesla skill on Amazon. And I was at a.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:03.700]   Oh, my Tesla show. Yeah, someone was like, have you tried this yet? And I was like, I have not,
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:10.420]   but now I have. And it's super fun. And you could even say, ask my car, dude, where's my car?
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:18.820]   I enjoy literally literally say the words dude. Yeah, yeah. You could also just say,
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.580]   where is my car? But it's way more fun to say, dude, where's my car? I like it.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:30.020]   So those are the commands you can do. And I'm adding it right now. The most cool, the most cool.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:35.140]   Yeah, I'll say that the start charging command is very helpful. Because sometimes you forget to
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.300]   start your, you plug it in, but like the schedule, it's scheduled for something and you need to go.
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:45.460]   Oh, yes. Then I would plug it in every time. And then I'd just say, start charging. That's nice.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:52.340]   There you go. So there in C, when you were going, crap, but you have to say, echo, dude,
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:56.100]   where's my car? Right? You have to say the trigger word. You have to say that.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:40:02.660]   I ask car or tell car. Where's my car? Tell car is opening the scale.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.220]   The problem with all these skills, they're so arcane.
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:10.740]   But have fun. Play with that. See what you think. So that's for the small percentage of people
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:18.340]   have a Tesla. But for the rest of us, which is everyone who likes Harry Potter, I put this on
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:22.660]   the list because I didn't know it existed. Kevin Tofel, my cohost on my show, was like,
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:28.660]   yeah, this has been out since like 2014. But do to me, I don't care. It's a remote control wand
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:36.660]   that converts. Or no, I'm sorry. It does not convert. It's just not convert to expect.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:42.980]   So CSI Las Vegas. I'm sorry. It does not convert it to Wi-Fi, my bad. But what it does is you
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:47.540]   program your remote with this thing. It's just an IR remote, basically, that you program.
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:54.100]   Is it gesture based? Yes. Yes, it is. And that is why it's fun.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:41:02.420]   So I think it's a pocket full. The Tesla, the guy who said he turned the computer in his Tesla
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:07.220]   into a Bitcoin miner. And he's using the free power from the supercharger to run it.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:14.180]   Yes, I did see that. That's got to be a that's got to be a joke. He's going to get a nasty
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:20.100]   gram from a lot of not going to be happy. It's definitely not. He could actually
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:25.620]   sure figure take your Tesla back. He could he could shut it down. It could be like, you know what?
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.740]   Because didn't they send out those letters to people in California? Like you can't charge
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:34.420]   here anymore? Right. So are you giving the TV remote wand to everybody in your household?
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:39.700]   I'm giving it to my mom because she's a huge Harry Potter. So yes,
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:46.420]   Lumos. I'm going to get one because for makers, that's great. You can have a
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:50.980]   our yeah. Well, no, you can you can add an IR receiver to your project, right? Now you can
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:56.020]   do a spell and make you know, you like to go off and all kinds of stuff. Skip us commercialists.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:02.820]   There you go. So it's kind of it's kind of expensive, but you know, it's it's pretty cool.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:09.140]   Maybe I'll just build one. Aaron, you're your tip this week.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:14.580]   Yeah. So actually, you know, you try to do a project and we'll see if my voice holds out.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:21.460]   Try to do a project every week. And this week, it is something I built for work. It's actually the,
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:26.020]   I don't know if you can see this. It's a big red button. Whoop. Whoa. It's I caught the
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:30.820]   holiday cheer box and it's a big red button on a green box. And it's pretty simple. When you press
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.700]   the button, it plays some sort of holiday sound. So let's see if you can hear this.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:43.220]   Oh, is that your kid? That okay. It says press here for holiday cheer. Press here for holiday cheer.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.940]   Let's try it again. Hey, Santa, what's shaking, man?
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:51.780]   So there's a bunch of just random sounds that I, you know, picked up from around the internet
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.420]   on there. And when someone walks by, if they're feeling a little, little blue or something,
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:00.580]   they can just press the button and it'll play a little sound. Maybe it'll cheer them up. I don't
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.500]   know. So it's just something fun, super easy using Arduino Nano and a little sound
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:11.540]   module that you can buy off of eBay or wherever you hook the two things up. I'm going to publish
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:16.500]   this on an instructor. Well, I tried to get it done in time for the show, but you know, life.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:22.900]   But follow me on, on Instructables. I'll put up an Instructable on how to build your own
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:26.420]   a little bit later on today. What? Instructables.com/earnukem or?
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:35.860]   Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Any W.C.O.M.B. Yeah, just do a search on Instructables and be
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:40.100]   looking out for it later today. It's fun. And the cool thing about this is you can build it into
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:45.540]   anything you want. So, you know, if you're having a Harry Potter party with your magic IR wand,
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:49.460]   you could build one that does Harry Potter sounds or whatever you want, you know, you can turn it
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:54.260]   into anything. So it's fun. I like it. Or just when you swivel your wand, it'll make a noise.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.780]   It'll make the noise go off. Perfect. I'm doing it.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:01.540]   Then you sound fancy. Yeah. All of your friends will be impressed.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:08.100]   I'm going to channel Jeff Jarvis and have a number of the week. And it's a number that has a
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:16.900]   near and dear to my heart. In 2017, digital ad spending, $209 billion worldwide,
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:25.460]   beating TV, $178 billion for the first time ever digital ad spending. That doesn't just,
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:34.500]   that's not just podcast. It's mostly panoramic, but still that is a big watershed event. And it's
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:43.300]   by a big margin. In fact, it's going to only get bigger. So good news for digital. People are
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:48.020]   making money doing it. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here for this week. And
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.220]   Google's thanks to Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on IOT.com at gigastacey on Twitter. And don't
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:59.940]   forget our podcast with Kevin Tofel. All about the Internet of Things. We'll see. Will you be here
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:06.980]   next week? I will be. Unless you don't invite me back. I invite you back. You have an invitation.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:14.660]   You must appear. I'm going to infect subpoena you. Oh, excellent. We call my lawyer. You have no
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:20.900]   choice. Thank you, Stacey. Aaron Nukem. Thank you so much for filling in. It's really great to have
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:27.140]   you. And again, generosity.com. Look for the Benisha Makerspace fundraiser.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:33.300]   A very good cause. It's a great thing. And you know, I think somebody calls Steve Case and say,
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:39.060]   you really want to help innovation in this country help Makerspaces.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:42.580]   Can I try add something? Yes. Go ahead.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:48.660]   I keep thinking you're saying Venetia, like Venice, like the city in Italy. But you're really
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:54.980]   saying, "Bunisha, a B." Yeah. So I didn't see it until I was like, no wonder I couldn't find it.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.340]   Yeah, not Venetia. Is this a promise? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:02.580]   Not a Venetia. This is actually the problem Chevy has with their Bolton vault. It's the same.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:08.260]   It sounds the same. Sounds the same. B as in Bravo, E-N-E-C-I-A for Benisha.
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:13.220]   You got it. Thank you, everybody, for being here. We do twig. Normally, this was an early one,
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:17.060]   because we're flip-flopping. In fact, Windows Weekly just around the corner with a very special
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:24.900]   Hawaiian edition. Don Ho will be singing. But normally, we do it at about 1.30 p.m. Pacific on
