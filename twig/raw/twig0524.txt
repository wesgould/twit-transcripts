[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.620]   Yeah, you did I screwed up the semi-colon
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.220]   We were discussing
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.700]   semi-colons. Oh my god a whole book
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.540]   He's a book on salt a whole book on salt
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.100]   Carson was trying to prevent us from doing any punctuation talk at the beginning of the show
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.580]   That's why we're doing it. We did it. We did it for half an hour before we began the show Stacy got a whole column in
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.120]   Yes, it was the most productive. I've ever been that's Stacy
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.440]   She's always filing at Stacy on IOT her IOT newsletter and of course the IOT podcast with Kevin TOEFL. Is that your new
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.080]   Three ads that's what I've been doing is I've been setting up
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   Jeff Jarvis is also your professor of journalism at CUNY the graduate school of journalism and he's also a blogger buzz machine
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.120]   Dot-com he is also using a 3a to you 3a people do you get Android 10?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   Not yet. No, I have and I'm my pixel 3 XL
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.240]   There's no way to to have it check for updates anymore. Yes, there is
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.420]   It's hidden. I can't tell you where it's hidden. I had to do this. I had to do this yesterday and it worked
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.520]   You go into settings. It's way down at the bottom where you at least expect it system
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.520]   Advanced advanced system updates
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.480]   Update
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   And I bet you you're gonna get it you will get dual sim support
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.320]   No, what career are you on?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.880]   I'm on AT&T huh because carriers can block it I believe
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.720]   But not just to listen support but simultaneous to some support. Yeah
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.020]   Isn't my fat dual sim you had to switch sim? No, no
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.920]   No, so at least in the dual sim phones. I've used like the OnePlus you can designate which sim to use for different
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.880]   apps
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.280]   So you can take phone calls from either I
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.160]   Think so. I don't know. Okay. That's an interesting question
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.320]   I don't know about that, but you could say I want my text messages on one sim and my phone calls on another
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.840]   No
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.920]   Can I get the the expert panels advice this goes for you guys and the chatroom?
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   Because I am giving my pixel to to my daughter
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.040]   Is it worth signing up for Google Fi and not giving her a sim card at all? She's 13
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.920]   pros and cons
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.080]   She will never be able to call you from or wait without Wi-Fi without Wi-Fi. Oh wait
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.320]   No, are you saying just get her a Google Fi data only sim?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.280]   No, I want to give her a phone system, right?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   No, no, can you use the virtual sim?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   Instead of a physical sim what she does. Oh the e-sim
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.080]   Yeah, I think is
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.600]   Yeah, it offered to be the chance to set up my phone. Yeah, it's easy using a sim right that's using Fi Fi supports e-sims
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   All carriers will support e-sims in the next in the coming year, but right now Fi does
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.600]   Yes, I think five is great. So here's the pros and cons Fi's 20 bucks flat for texts and messages for texts and phone calls in the US
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.760]   Period that's done. That's every month and then 10 bucks per gigabyte or less perfection of gigabyte as used
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.080]   so
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.080]   If she doesn't use a lot of data and she probably won't because I bet you she uses the phone data mostly at home with Wi-Fi
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.680]   Maybe at school
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.920]   Then you then you will have a very in a very inexpensive phone
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.520]   All right, well, I'm gonna do it and see
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.440]   But she should still be able to like if she's you know down by the docks at night and she's like
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.080]   It uses at least for now
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.680]   I don't know what's gonna happen if T-Mobile sprint merger goes through but right now uses T-Mobile and sprint and US cellular
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.960]   and Wi-Fi and it'll choose whatever's best so
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.400]   I've not had any connectivity problems at all with it
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.960]   Including here where we don't get T-Mobile very well at all. I guess it goes to sprint
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.760]   Thank you guys because yes, the other option was to add or two Verizon, which is like
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.000]   Giving you money and that's a and the problem with that is you often I don't know if this is still the case
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.880]   but
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.440]   It was shared data and our 16 year old who was then about 13 would go through all the data every month in the first week
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.080]   and then and then mom Lisa goes
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Michael
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   You use them on the data again. So finally we went to T-Mobile where he could use as much as he wanted
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.400]   You could try visible. Yeah, I'm that person in our family visible is the new Verizon thing. That's interesting
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   And being a sort of because it's not really because it's their own thing. That's only that's only 40
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.440]   That's $40 flat a month and it's supposedly unlimited data, right? Yeah, it's unlimited data
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.640]   Well, she doesn't she really doesn't use that much data
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.400]   So I'm not I think I think phi is actually a good choice for somebody doesn't use a lot of data
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.040]   Of course there's a sponsor
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   Which is mint mobile, but that's really more for if you know you're gonna use a certain amount of data every month
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.160]   Then it's more economical than phi, but if you don't use that data you don't get money back phi you get money back if you don't use the data
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.040]   So I think it's probably a better you know, it's interesting is how competitive and how much variety there is
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.400]   And according to many states attorneys general that's about to go away with these sprint team mobile merger
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.160]   I don't know if I believe that I agree with them
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   I I have conflicting opinions. Although I do find like I am
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.320]   I consider myself pretty smart about carriers and pricing plans that even I am trying to research what to do for her
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:43.160]   What's best? I am like oh shoot me in the head. It's so much Jeff. You don't want android 10 because it's dark mode
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.240]   I just said that to see what would happen
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   You can you don't have to use dark mode. Yeah, but I won't be able to see how to switch it off
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.520]   I like dark mode, but not everybody that's obvious
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:06.440]   YouTube hey, you haven't me the other day. I was driving like google maps. I don't really use I use wet ways
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.880]   And we're coming back to the us open and ways wasn't working for whatever reason
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.680]   So I have a google map so we go into the lake and tunnel and it goes to dark mode and I start traveling like that
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:24.760]   Yeah, but that's not the same as operating system wide dark mode. That's just a weird thing that maps us. Oh, it's to protect your eyes at night
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.800]   You don't want a big bright phone the laring at you while you're trying to drive at night
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.560]   I also don't want a dark phone. I can't read and kept you where the road is
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:42.760]   I love dark mode. Yeah me too. You would we're dark just to spite me. I know just to spite you
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   I know she's the angel is zero zero and we are david tenant
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.320]   Whoever he is
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   YouTube okay, what?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.160]   I was gonna say I sent my daughter out to like talk to I told her to go talk to my tomato plants
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.320]   Yeah, this is only a david tender reference
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   And I go outside just to see what she's doing because she had been gone for a while
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   And I hear her yelling at my plants grow better
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   Like probably
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.400]   That is all okay
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   That your daughter is officially cool. I'm not gonna be locked today. That is awesome
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.520]   Talk to the tomato plant says hippie dippy mom
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   Daughter goes out starts screaming grow better
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   It was excellent
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   All right, youtube i'm gonna try one more time
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.080]   Yeah, let's do actual show stuff. I'm just gonna throw this so as to react
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:47.000]   We'll pay 170 million dollars to settle claims. It violated child privacy laws. It's just across the wires today ftc
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.640]   Says it violated the children's online privacy protection act the settlement
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.480]   was uh
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.600]   voted
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.000]   Through the ftc in a three two vote the democrats said it wasn't mean enough
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.800]   republicans said enough already
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.120]   um
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.760]   the uh, the new york attorney general also
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   We'll get some money
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.560]   Uh 34 million for the state of york, hundred 36 million to the ftc
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.800]   It's the largest amount the ftc's ever obtained in a kappa case since the law was enacted in 1998
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:28.760]   When it this is what ftc chairman joe simon said when it came to complying with kappa youtube refused to acknowledge the portions of its platform
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.480]   We're clearly directed to kids
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.600]   child directed sites
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.920]   Are another words that portion of youtube including i would guess the thing labeled youtube kids
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.400]   Must disclose data practices and get parental consent before collecting information on kids age 13 and under
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.920]   Let me understand this this was was this stuff that was apparently for kids or was labeled by youtube for kids
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:03.800]   youtube and google according to the new york attorney general knowingly and illegally monitored tracked and served targeted ads to young children
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.200]   just
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.080]   To keep advertising dollars rolling in these companies put children at risk and abuse their power
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.360]   Uh, it's not clear. I don't maybe it doesn't encompass youtube
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.640]   Yeah, there is an issue there. No, no, it's just if you keep reading
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:24.600]   It talks about youtube aggressively marketed itself to children's toy companies by saying they could reach children
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.720]   Yeah, which means they told the advertisers they could do it
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   Yeah, it's basically kappa says you're not allowed to monetize kids to add
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   Ties to kids
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:42.120]   Think about it when a network puts on cartoon programming and sells it to has bro
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.400]   Isn't that exactly what they're doing? Is that why there is a law against that?
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.760]   There is a law actually the f against that. Oh, yeah, the fcc mandates
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.800]   Time for advertising to children like via cartoons. That's why we have
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.320]   And they they actually have laws related to that, but it's not kappa
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.240]   It's a different set of laws associated with it. Yeah, it was of course the networks don't really gather information about who's watching
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.640]   They just provide just like we do it's like we don't gather information about people watching twig
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.840]   But we know something about them because the nature of the content
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.920]   No, they the tv tv does the same thing they have nyelson boxes that say who who's watching
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:26.680]   Any specific kid no, but they know how many kids basically they're they're allowed to give it's not a privacy violation
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.760]   It's not a privacy violation there. They are allowed to give their nyelson
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:38.280]   Information to advertisers, but one of the democrats who wanted more a stricter fine
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.880]   Rohit Chopra in a descent said this latest violation is extremely serious the company
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:51.000]   Bated children using nursery rhymes cartoons and other kid directed content on curated youtube channels
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.960]   I would gather that's youtube kids defeat its massively profitable behaviorally based advertising business
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.280]   He wanted uh, he wanted something more serious
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.760]   Um, I I kind of agree. I mean
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:16.280]   Because first of all 170 million dollars is nothing right for google. Yeah, they made that much money on elsagate videos since we started talking about that
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.800]   right
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:25.160]   Now the the youtube blog post with this says they're also going to invest a hundred million dollars in children's programming
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.600]   So I wonder if that's them trying to kind of create a controlled space
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.360]   Yeah, well, that's what you'd have to do right and you would have to make sure that you got parental permission
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.920]   Before a kid could log into that
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   Maybe you don't and maybe they don't log in at all. Maybe you don't collect any information
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.200]   But then how would you monetize them? Sorry
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.720]   Uh, well the same way the networks monetize uh saturday morning cartoons, which don't exist anymore
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.120]   But uh if they did they they sell I mean I they have kids
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.680]   I will tell you they have kids shows and they have
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.360]   Advertising and advertising is not for bud wiser
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:10.040]   No, but it's for like as bro, honey smacks or yeah crazy. I mean my daughter who grew up in this weird
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.600]   Blip of time where we only had netflix and no cable. She hadn't actually seen
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.520]   She'd never seen these ads so she didn't want any of this stuff. It was weird to me. Yeah
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:28.920]   Like and now she just doesn't even know what to do with advertising now. I I so confused my I this ties into it and uh
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.880]   I am a little concerned about this, but it's just come out
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.160]   This is from the financial times
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:44.280]   That google has been doing some sort of weird thing and I don't really understand it yet. So it made no sense to me
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.320]   Yeah, and unfortunately it's behind a paywall behind a paywall, but I saw another story somewhere that just that said that
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.120]   it's so apparently
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.280]   uh the financial times um
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.200]   Uh security guy. Let me see if I could find it a little hard to talk about it if we can't read it
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.320]   Yeah, I saw through the paywall briefly, but now I can't anymore
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.600]   gosh darn paywalls
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.440]   Uh, I suppose I could I could spend money to get the financial times
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.480]   But I remember what the guy said is he was doing an analysis of what chrome was gathering on him
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.440]   And it turned out they chrome created an invisible page
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.480]   That had no content on it
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:32.120]   But had his unique identifier his google identifier on it a page that advertisers could pull up
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.000]   Let me see if I can see I gotta see that story. I gotta see that story here. Okay
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.960]   Okay, prepare your autoplay
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.920]   Yeah, and then that's another yeah, so it's a choice between autoplay and paywalls. I don't know
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.560]   Well, I pay for a lot of the chat financial times is kind of expensive
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:58.520]   I can't really afford it. It's a good. It's a it's good in response google said it doesn't serve personalized ads or send bid request to bidders without user consent
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.720]   Yeah, but that process laid out by ryan could potentially be cookie matching or cookie sinking
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.520]   It's an ad industry practice of matching ads across multiple sites based on a user's browsing history
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   It's a non denial denial from google
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.520]   A google developer page on cookie matching explains the process and the privacy principles the search engine follows
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.240]   Such as not allowing the input to be harvested by the
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   So I don't I don't want to jump on this only because
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   It's yeah, it's just I came out this morning. I didn't have really time to dig
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.280]   Into it, but the the point was uh johnny ryan
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.000]   Who works at brave? He's their chief
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.640]   policy officer brave is a
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.000]   Chrome based private privacy browser, which I like a lot
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.480]   He submitted this as evidence to ireland, which is investigating google to the ireland data protection commission
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.680]   um, so
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.960]   I think we are I have not heard the end of this ryan said he discovered that google used a tracker
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.600]   containing web browsing information
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.400]   Location and other data
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.880]   And sent it to ad companies via web pages that quote showed no content
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.760]   This could allow companies buying ads to match a user's google profile and web activity
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:17.800]   To profiles from other companies and in fact that is against google's own ad buying rules according to the financial times
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.240]   Google denial does not is not really a denial so I don't
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.040]   Yeah, they're saying that these
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.880]   Everybody does indeed get this unique web page identifier
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.240]   What it seems to be saying is they're not serving personalized ads or sending bids
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.360]   Without user consent, which is just basically saying at some point in time. You must have agreed to this
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.280]   Yeah, if you search for cookie batching
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.560]   You get some descriptions of this
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.240]   So maybe
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.440]   Maybe people did opt into this with google
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.640]   And then that would make it gdpr compliant
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.720]   right, but maybe they opted in without realizing they were opting in because
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:09.320]   Some of these conditions are painful. This is uh, mache as i was insky from clear code the clear code blog
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   What is cookie syncing it has at work?
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.320]   If you're working online advertising, you probably heard of cookie syncing
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.680]   There's a video there you can play. Yeah, why do ad tech and data companies use it?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.040]   um
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.200]   So this is by the way why i have started using firefox and the latest version of firefox
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   Uh is even more aggressive in blocking this kind of tracking. It's got new anti tracking protection
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.400]   It allows you to turn off fingerprinting. It also allows you to block third-party cookies
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.600]   But the issue is of course fingerprinting is starting to replace third-party cookies
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.640]   And that's what we're talking about a unique id on the user's computer
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.520]   Which allows advertisers to track you moving from page to page
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.120]   It's a it's a form of fingerprinting
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.320]   So cookie syncing
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.800]   Uh boy
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.480]   Most this is this is more arcane than going to a punctuation
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.360]   Yeah, let's but it is more relevant to what we are supposed to be talking about
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.360]   So it's like a super cookie. It's a super cookie for advertisers
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.920]   Because so the idea i guess i should start at the beginning with first-party cookies, which is originally the intent of cookies
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.480]   Is that when you go to starbucks site?
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.200]   Starbucks can remember what your order was can remember what your password is and
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.080]   Obviously they don't store that or they they don't want to store that on their site. They store it on your
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.600]   Computer as a cookie. It's just a persistent bit of information. That's a first-party cookie
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.880]   Only starbucks can read that cookie the problem is of late when you go to starbucks
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:00.760]   There is also a facebook like button a twitter like button a share on twitter button a google plus button stuff like that
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.320]   all of those buttons
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.480]   Are actually served by facebook twitter and google
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.240]   Any cookie they set is technically a first-party cookie
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:18.360]   Because you loaded content from facebook the problem is you're not on facebook you're on starbucks
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.520]   So that's what we call a third-party cookie and the danger of it is
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:28.120]   Facebook can now track you on every site that has a facebook like button on it
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.520]   Uh and see everywhere you go if you go to then pete's coffee
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.400]   They know you've been to starbucks starbucks doesn't know pete's doesn't know but facebook knows
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.360]   So as mentioned previously cookies are domain specific those created by one
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:53.160]   Third-party tracker like lot of me calm cannot be read by another third-party tracker like app nexus similarly twitter can't read facebook's cookies and vice versa
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.400]   for advertisers
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   This restricts the potential amount of information they can collect about a user therefore in order to accurately target an audience
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.360]   Advertisers need to incorporate user data from various domains
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.640]   And sources which happens as part of not so much just facebook or or or
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.600]   It's at nexus or it's the it's the it's the programmatic adnet works
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.560]   Yes
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.920]   So that's when you get these data buying agreements and partnerships where i'll give you mine if you give me yours
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:33.000]   Advertisers are able to achieve this by and this is the key here mapping user ids from one system to another
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.720]   So this is your app nexus id. This is your google id. This is your facebook id. It's all the same person
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   So now i know a lot more of you that's cookie sinking
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.520]   Did that make sense my description of that
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:54.920]   In other words, i'm saying leo has cookie a from google cookie b from facebook cookie c from twitter
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   That's all all those three things ab and c represent leo
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:05.880]   By sinking those i now have a bigger dossier of all of leo surfing from those various companies
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.080]   ab and c becomes leo when you say i have it who are you playing
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.160]   Well the advertiser would be one google would be another
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   Anybody who's selling ads right
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:26.920]   Uh, the cookie sinking process is used by most ad tech platforms including ad networks. That's google
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:34.200]   Demand side platforms. Don't know who that is is that facebook data management dsp's there's there's um
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   it
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.720]   Dsp's are part of the programmatic ad network. So a demand side
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:49.560]   Um so complicated. This is part of the problem with that tech in general is it is a very convoluted elaborate process
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.760]   With one goal in mind to track your everything you do on the net so that the advertiser can target you
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:03.960]   Uh the results of the cookie sinking process benefit those mentioned above ad tech dsp's dmp's data management platforms ad exchanges
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   supply side platforms
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.520]   And they're dsp and ssp yeah the dsp
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:16.360]   Allows the buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple ad exchange and data exchanges
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.080]   And the ssp allows the seller the media company to do that. Yeah and the to talk
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:28.760]   They to talk so you could see this is the cookie sinking from dsp to dnv happening right here. What's what's happening here?
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.200]   And this this enables retargeting
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.440]   So you go to amazon you see a pair of boots those boots follow you around uh for three weeks
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.280]   um
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:45.000]   Because the data about you being boot interested is more more valuable now than any
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.720]   uh proximity to editorial content in
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.520]   uh, you know boot world
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.960]   And so whenever you are if you're going to weather.com or you're going to um
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.800]   Uh good yogurt.com
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.520]   There is a cookie set on you a user idea on you that you are boot interested
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.600]   And that enables
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.840]   Yo best yogurt dot com to make some money because they know there's nobody wants to advertise yogurt
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.000]   But the the boot ad is there and that's what enables that and in media
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.240]   This is proven to be two things both valuable and commodifying
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:26.040]   It's valuable because now media companies news companies for example can present their ad inventory their unsold inventory
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.200]   Which they have plenty of
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.880]   To a wide range of advertisers they would never reach because they would never go and get rfp's from them
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.440]   The bad part is that it commodifies media because now you don't go by a boot ad in
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.200]   You know outdoor world magazine. You can put it anywhere because what's valuable now is the user
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.160]   Um, so the whole program. I was at it. I had an event at the school where a
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.760]   Major executive in programmatic kind of yelled at the media people and said why are you doing this?
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.400]   This is somebody who made his living programmatic. Why are you using programmatic? It commodifies you
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.640]   And then the chief revenue officer from a major media site in the room said
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.240]   Um
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.360]   Sorry, man. I got to because that's where the ad dollars are going
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.160]   Um, the ad dollars aren't flowing through
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.920]   Proposable for proposals and powerpoints and all that anymore
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   They're flowing through these platforms because there's a there's a there's an instant auction
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.520]   That gets the best possible prices and better targeting and that's the way the media world
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.880]   operates these days
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.760]   So it's not just that facebook and google are doing evil things
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.080]   It's that this is the way the entire ad infrastructure is working these days
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.440]   It's true and it gets harder and harder for us because we don't do that
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.120]   To survive in this ecosystem because advertisers expect it
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.440]   Uh, here's it and now you comes down from yeah, and yeah, so
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.680]   If you're in so this is a cookie sync script from pubmatic
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.360]   What happens by the way when you click this link is you're going to get a blank page like the one
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:04.200]   The brave guy explained, uh, the google's doing so essentially it says google's doing is offering cookies syncing
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.920]   Now when I click this when do you ever get that page?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.320]   Well, you never see the you that's the point the user doesn't see it. This is part of see
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.680]   I don't the user doesn't need to see anything. That's what makes no sense the well
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.840]   But it happens is it synchronizes the cookies. So that's my end up at that page to do the syncing
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.280]   They ask for it. That's your id
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   No, no, no, no
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.920]   I the user never click on that you never see it blank page
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.400]   No, no, well then then then then the tree fell in the forest and it didn't sync
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:41.960]   Because you didn't see it, but the ad guy did you're ad page clicked your your little boot ad
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.720]   On it. Yeah, you don't have to do anything. It's all done for you jeff
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.120]   You're when when you saw when you saw the ad that that
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.400]   You got because you're a boot seekie person
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:03.160]   That secret a boot seeker that that that hidden page that hidden page got shared
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:10.120]   So I run you block origin which blocks all this stuff when I clicked on this link to get to my secret page
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:16.840]   You block origin said no no no no this is an ad tracker. I'm gonna temporarily stop blocking it
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.080]   Oops, and then I'm gonna get another one, but there is finally the you sync
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.480]   Blank page there's no content on the page because that's not the point of it
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:33.320]   All you need is the id I still I still don't understand. I've never get that tab with the blank page. You shouldn't
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   No, but you won't see it. No, it's not for you. You're humans. Not for you humans for a machine
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.920]   Is getting that yeah page and it's using it to sync
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yes, so that was the that's the allegation from financial times
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.000]   and uh from johnny ryan of brave
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:58.200]   The which is honestly probably not surprising because other ad tech companies do this as well
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.640]   Uh, so it's not surprising that google's doing it
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.840]   however
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.800]   The problem is that google says well, we don't do that
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:15.080]   So that's going to be the question is is google saying they don't do that
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.800]   So this was just a very confusing 10 minutes of iapologist and I wish I had
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.120]   Had the time because it just came out today, but I thought we should talk about I wish I'd had the time to kind of
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.960]   Parse it a little bit better, but you you got to engage with us as we were
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.760]   As we were parsing parsing it and you offered a really helpful
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:40.200]   I mean, it's a really helpful overview of the ad industry, which is really hard and convoluted to understand. Well, it's kind of amazing
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:47.080]   and uh, and this is why yeah, well and this is why ad blockers and tracking protection
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.040]   And this is the problem is you're getting this escalation now in this war between ad tech
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.600]   And users who I think not unreasonably say well, but wait a minute
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.320]   I don't I don't want you doing that
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.640]   What really needs to happen I think though
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.280]   Is some sort of transparency so users can opt in
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.720]   Because honestly a lot of you know, we don't that's not how we make our money
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.680]   But we're in a little very old school the way we make our money is so old school compared to this
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.200]   And I fear that in years to come advertisers are going to just say well if you can't give us that data
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.720]   We're going somewhere else and there are podcasters who will start doing this there will be this kind of ad tech
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:33.160]   In podcasting it's coming. That's one of the things that we're talking about at the podcast expo the podcast movement
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.720]   It's coming. I don't want to do it
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.200]   And they're technical difficulties because
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.040]   uh
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.600]   It's it's one thing on a web page because you're using a browser and all the all the browsers until recently
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   Supported this
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.520]   Now they're starting to block and that's big work coming
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.440]   But right now when you listen to a podcast there's so many ways you can listen to a podcast
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   That there's no there's no system for doing this at all in podcasting it, but they're working on oh, they're working on it
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.480]   Hidden tones the my friends at the interactive advertising bureau iab would love this
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:14.360]   Um, so and it could increase the value immensely too. Let's let's let's there's there's value to the content creator here. Yeah
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.840]   Well and so this is the this is the this is why it needs to be a conversation and why it needs to be more transparent
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.480]   It could put twit out of business if I refuse to do it
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.040]   It could be the end of twit and a lot of podcasts
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.720]   If if the owners of the podcast networks say we don't want to do that
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.160]   Advertisers could turn away and say well, we're only going to buy ads on where we know this kind of information
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Conversely if they find a really good way to do it and we agree to it it could make us all incredibly wealthy
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:48.600]   There's another problem, which is the kind of ads we do do not lend themselves to pro programmatic advertising, right?
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   I read an ad it's built it's baked in
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.960]   Well, that's that's also why you get those kinds of ads you get direct response. I think they work better, right?
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.320]   but in order for this to work with have to have what's called di or dynamic insertion
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.960]   Uh because just as you all you see different banner ads as you go to around the web based on your boot preference
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.920]   Podcast people buy ads and podcasts would like you to have different ads served to you depending on your geographic location
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.560]   Your demographics what they know about you
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.760]   And so it's increasingly popular
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.960]   Uh in large podcasts to have dynamic insertion
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.280]   And it's yeah, there's there's a company called for example, uh a million ads
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:35.000]   That does this there are companies that start to do this they're doing dynamic serving in podcast. So it's coming
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.400]   Uh, it's here. There's a
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.080]   13 there's there's one we've tried we've tried it
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.280]   um
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.760]   Or is it a 16? I think it's a 16 we tried it. Uh, yeah with
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.920]   Back catalog so our stuff is so baked in it's kind of we'd have to completely redo how we do ads
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.480]   But what but we have a long tail, right? We only sell
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   We only get paid for ads in the first six weeks of the show or something like that
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.960]   After that the ad doesn't go away because we don't edit it out, but but we don't get paid for it
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   So whatever hits an ad gets in in month three four five six
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.800]   That's just free to the advertiser. We get no revenue from it. So what we've tried doing
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.600]   Uh, when we've looked at and maybe end up doing is not on the first run
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.360]   But after those six weeks starting to replace existing baked in ads with dynamically inserted ads
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.000]   Uh because we don't get the same kind of money for dynamically inserted ads
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.800]   Although honestly as you're listening to it
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.480]   It would probably still be me reading it might not be so different. I wouldn't be quite as tightly integrated into it
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.040]   It's like when you go out of town. Yeah. Yeah, there's there you rolling in a pre pre-record
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.000]   Here's the bad news. You've got to record 100 ads tomorrow. Yeah
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.680]   I have
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.080]   I would like to keep doing what we do
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.880]   Who knows what'll happen though, and I would be ticked
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.640]   There's also by the way and this is a complete different the iab is also insisting on a new ad
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.560]   a new uh
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.560]   people counting
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.240]   Technology that I my opinion dramatically under counts mobile users
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.080]   It really hurts
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.680]   Podcasts with a high tech audience people like you who listen on your phone and on your google and amazon
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.800]   No, no normal people don't
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.840]   normal normal people
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:30.040]   Don't and so normal people listen to podcast they get counted more
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.640]   Yeah, now they do and they get counted better. So what is going to also happen?
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.000]   I think it very subtly is these new ad these new audience measurement technologies
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.280]   Uh will hurt certain podcasts and so it's going to homogenize podcasts podcast like ours will go away
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.360]   Because we have a high technically literate audience that uses mobile
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.560]   There's a bunch of reasons. I don't want to get going on this. There's no one listening to our podcast is normal
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.840]   That's for sure. Yeah, you're abnormal to begin with so uh
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.320]   Podcasts
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.960]   Like mainstream podcasts like cereal and stuff which hit a more normal audience
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:13.640]   Are going to get counted more effectively their numbers are going to go up our numbers are going to go down and eventually you're going to have a homogenization of the podcast arena
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.160]   which I
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.480]   regret as well and that's going to be very subtle you're not going to in my opinion that kind of add
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.720]   Uh that that that audience count difference is not going to be apparent
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.240]   But it is I don't know maybe it maybe it will just be
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.040]   This is my hope maybe it will just be less efficient to sell ads on those more niche podcasts
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.200]   Well, yeah, but eventually it gets harder and harder to do because you don't you know
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.560]   We spent a lot look what what we do here. We spent a lot of money
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.880]   That's all that would all have to change right? Yes
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.880]   Um
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.920]   So you're going to get yes, what what will happen is the great middle will go away
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   You're going to get the very high revenue
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.680]   Uh intense podcasts that are from big brands because they can do all this stuff
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.200]   You're going to get the hobbyist podcast that don't monetize at all and the stuff like us the independent networks in the middle
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   I think are just going to disappear
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.600]   Uh, but by the way, this is exactly what happened with blogs when ad tech first came into
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.240]   blogs
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:17.640]   Uh the the the voxes and the verges and the the the big blogs the of the world
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.800]   survived
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   blogs like yours
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.720]   Kind of survived because it was hobbyist blog, but but this middle the john groobers of the world
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.880]   Uh, you know during fireballs kind of struggle because they're not willing to do the ad tech stuff
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.960]   But they do need to monetize so it gets I think this kind of what happens
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.680]   But I don't know, you know I could be wrong. Um
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.360]   You know the the bigger question is
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.560]   Um
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   in the long run
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:56.280]   In an abundant base market what happens to volume based advertising the prices will keep going down and down and down now
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.160]   Right
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.560]   And some scare is not going to be worth it and you have to have new there's no scarcity and so at some point
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.120]   Entirely new models and I believe they're going to be service based models and journalism
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.040]   Are going to emerge and yes, there's gonna be paywalls behind that there's gonna be other kinds of
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.240]   That's probably exactly what will happen with podcasting too. I bet you're right. Yeah, I think that's exactly right
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.680]   So we should offer some more actionable grammar tips if we want people to pay for this
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.680]   Actionable grammar actual grammar tips. Yes. I
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.640]   Poultry tips. I did get a
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.680]   Upside down in taro bang and twitter and i'm sure i'm
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.200]   allowing
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.880]   That's that this looks in taro bang. I screwed up. I just cut and paste it. I got in there. Yeah upside down in taro
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.480]   Wow
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   Aren't you fancy?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.440]   We need the habanichi tacho people to sponsor us. We can do product placements
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   It's sitting here right on the desk exactly
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.080]   Gee, I wonder what that is. I sure would like to buy one of these
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.480]   They just went on sale this week. We just went on sale this week
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.360]   Um google is
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   We've discussed before I mean did you try to be wire cutter?
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:12.840]   You mean affiliate links? We did a little bit with our we and we do now with our with our product show we do
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.640]   affiliate links for
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.920]   um
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.400]   Amazon you can't do it in a podcast I for obvious no
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.640]   but on our on our site if you go to hands on tech if you click a link that'll have it affiliate the link to
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.880]   Uh to the product then it's maybe a yeah a few hundred bucks a month
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.640]   Yeah, we no way that's just that gonna pay anybody's power. It's a fine still thing
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.720]   We're gonna pay you a car. It's two products a week
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.880]   Like that's not gonna pay anyway, but we've had we tried it twit picks
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.680]   You know, we've tried a lot of different things, but honestly really
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.680]   99% of the revenue comes from the ads that you hear on these shows
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:53.640]   That's fine. I mean we we've done very well. It might be you know, I'm I'm getting a retirement age. It's not
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.680]   No
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.040]   I'm gonna write it down. I was just see what happens. I
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.600]   I don't want to solve what I'd be doing. I don't want to be chicken
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.280]   I don't want to be chicken little but I do I think that I love
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.960]   Being in a medium a new medium where it's uh like this is democratic. It's it's um
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.040]   It's not mass media. It's not mainstream and I love that. I think it's great to be able to do that having come from the mass medium
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.440]   And still having a foot in mass media. I really love what we can do with podcasts. Not just mine all podcasts
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.520]   It's really exciting. It's a new world
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.960]   It's really really cool. You can't tell what we need to be contained about college. Okay
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.920]   Carson, you could go get a different job. I'm just saying
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   No
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.600]   Anything with this
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.080]   Basically anybody who's still working here is stuck here. That's that's really the story
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.200]   Including me. I might add
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.080]   Can you see me on the street pounding the pavement looking for work?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.960]   Uh, this is another story that broke today. Don't know what's gonna happen, but according to the washington post more than half
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.640]   Of the state attorneys general are preparing to announce an investigation into google next week
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.960]   a big antitrust probe from the states
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:18.120]   They are expected to unveil the investigation on monday at a news conference in washington
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.680]   This is according to the post and three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:30.840]   Uh, it's not clear according to the post whether some or all of the attorneys general also plan to open or announce additional probes into other tech giants
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   Including amazon and facebook
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.400]   This is kind of interesting. This is what's been sort of happening and happen with a sprint merger
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.440]   Sprint team old merger as well the feds approved it
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:47.960]   But the states have jurisdiction too and the states attorneys general seem to be more and more willing to wade into these anti-trust matters
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.920]   I think part of it is probably
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.480]   Go ahead and say see they see
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.040]   Part of it is a reflection of our current political climate and the huge
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.800]   Kasm is one might say in states you'll look and see and those are probably more
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.760]   populous and they will
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.000]   Speak out where they'd kill the federal government is letting them down and
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.960]   I expect to see this not just in tech mergers
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.600]   But across a lot of other things like some of the rollbacks of various federal regulations
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.880]   We're already seeing states come up and say uh, nope. We're gonna implement our own laws then
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   So I think that's a function of the times we live in yeah
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.960]   Well, it's also but it's hard for somebody like google because
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.280]   Now you have kind of uh death by a thousand cuts piecemeal
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.160]   Attacks for instance
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.120]   Not all of the states attorneys general have the same agenda
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.960]   according to the post
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.600]   Texas officials are worried as our luisiana, mrs. Sippy about
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.440]   uh
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.560]   politics
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.800]   political bias at google and the censorship of conservative viewpoints
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.480]   uh
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:03.000]   That's Texas, but luisiana mrs. Sippy sharply criticized google for its handling of users personal information
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   Uh, they're also concerned about the surfacing of search results in a political bias. So there's a mix of concerns here
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.920]   And that means and agendas and agendas and google's got to fight on a lot of different fronts
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.520]   This is what happens when
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.560]   We don't have a working mechanism to hash out our differences that used to be congress
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.640]   Now it's
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.240]   Increasingly it's the courts and it's through these systems. So it makes sense that we I mean
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.520]   This is if you look at this the same way you would look at all the parties weighing in
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.360]   um
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:48.120]   The different entities affected by laws into the writing of legislation. That's kind of what's happening. Yeah, it's just happening through the courts and again
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.600]   it's
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.200]   six years ago the uh
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.440]   Obama administration declined the ftc declined to prosecute google
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.160]   Over their search or ad business. They decided not to give it any penalties
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.160]   currently the justice department the ftc and
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:11.480]   Senate lawmakers are all investigating and now these uh now these estates are also going to get into the matter
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:18.440]   I should point out and the point post does that this happened with a microsoft case way back in the 90s when microsoft was being
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.480]   uh
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   prosecuted by the justice department their own
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.400]   States attorneys general also got involved in that
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.720]   But what it usually ends up happening is the federal government coordinates with states
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:38.200]   That and that's that system maybe is broke breaking down because you could see right here with the sprint t mobile merger that that's gone through with the federal government
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.760]   But it's hung up now by
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.280]   I think 28 states some large number of states
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.040]   Uh, I guess it's not large enough to write an amendment to the constitution. No
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.080]   Can't do that
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.280]   Um, you know, so when I talk about our little pitally problems at podcasting
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.720]   I'm glad i'm not google. That's all I can say
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.640]   Well, I think even with the headaches would be worth it to be google
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.840]   Yeah, just hire more attorneys, you know, you don't have to worry about it
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.200]   Think about the quality of snacks you would have in the office. Oh, we have pretty good snacks. Don't you think
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.760]   We have options. Okay. I once had
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:22.040]   I had chipotle queso that is not high quality snacks. Those new chick that was that was for you
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.680]   There is a box marked leo only
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:32.200]   Which is which has macadamia nuts and and shelled pistachio nuts, which apparently are he readily expensive
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.320]   You have to shell your own. Sorry
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.000]   Only leo gets
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.040]   Pre-shelled i've told everybody's reach in the Greenwich Village day and I and I over here
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.040]   Dude, you know I can't eat sushi keto
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.640]   keto just eat the fish off the top. It's okay
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:54.440]   That's pretty funny. Well, we're gonna hear that keto the keto cry more often. I think
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.240]   It's spreading
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.840]   Yes, I'm gonna host Thanksgiving for my parents who are keto and by gosh
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   I don't know. I mean turkey. No, thanks. Well, it's easy for keto. You just don't eat the mashed potatoes or stuffing
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.400]   You have the turkey you have the green beans
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.000]   There's plenty of stuff. They can't eat. Yeah, they can have vegetables
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.720]   Not my parents. They don't even eat veggies. They just eat meat
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.160]   Yeah, can they have the the
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.200]   Sweet potatoes. No
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.080]   No sweet potatoes or do you
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.320]   How about sweet potatoes with the marshall? What are you nuts?
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.280]   It'll be a sauce
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.520]   No, that's that's so sugary. That's like just sour sugar green beans are a little carby. I have to say so
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   Okay, maybe get make him some broccoli
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.000]   We
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.560]   They can
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   Brussels sprouts
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.440]   Oh totally
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.960]   Drizzled with butter
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.400]   Okay
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.160]   Just think about it. No no carbs. That's all it's easy. That's the thing about keto
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   It's very easy to do and any we had pizza
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.960]   Uh for the staff today. I just took the top off left the crust behind
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.800]   So you had cheese wrapped in meat
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.880]   Gosh, it's good to be keto
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.600]   Do you use cauliflower flour?
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:26.360]   Dye, don't use cauliflower flour because when you mill stuff it gets a little dicey, but I use cauliflower all the time
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.440]   I love cauliflower. That's that's fine cauliflower rice is very very good
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.640]   Especially if you make it with parmesan cheese and garlic
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.560]   Good. Oh guys. I only had a salad for lunch
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.160]   Ah
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:46.760]   It's gonna kill me. I had greasy cheese mapped it wrapped in meat myself. No greasy meat wrapped in cheese greasy meat wrapped in cheese
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.960]   I'm so excited across the street from me is opening a taco bell at work
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.280]   Are you ready for what does they call it fifth meal?
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.520]   Fourth meal fourth meal. Why not have five?
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.160]   Let's make it six
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.880]   That is the that is that is the quintessential
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:12.840]   Add campaign in like I don't know how to it's just fourth meal. Yeah, you know three meals a day. It's not quite enough
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   Let's go talk about american
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.160]   Super size me
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.760]   So uh stacey if you had the papa's fried chicken sandwich whoo
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.200]   No, but I really wanted to we all do I did
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.040]   I'm not gonna fight for that. Have you had a chick fillet sandwich?
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.760]   Well, this is the battle is which is better. I won't need a chick fillet because of their politics. So
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   Yeah, I'm going to pop eyes
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   But everybody's saying that the new chicken sandwich at pop eyes. How do we get on these tangents is uh
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.520]   Is uh like the the next coming if there's lines around the walk
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:53.320]   Well, no, no, they they ran out. They had to get rid of it. I went to a store social media battles massive crowds and overworked employees
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.800]   Boy, that does look great. The staff was completely crazed
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:04.200]   And it's been like that. They had to stop selling the 330 now they've stopped selling it entirely because they're basically went out of chicken suppliers
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.120]   what
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.800]   Yeah, sold out this was
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.520]   You sold out there were lines and every pop eyes
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.760]   The staff was was was going working overtime driving crazy
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.120]   Um huge issue for workers rights here
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.600]   How does this even happen? This is how the restaurant wars begin
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.240]   We're gonna have only
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.800]   Max no it was uh demolition man only talk only
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.360]   All restaurants will be Taco Bell within the next five years. I hope not
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.160]   Pop eyes. I've never been
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:45.720]   Pop eyes fried chicken sandwiches great little mayo and pickles the pickles are a nice touch
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:51.240]   I think the pickles are a nice. Pickles make the chick fillet sandwich. I don't know about the mayo. I'm anti-mayo
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.360]   But the pop eyes chicken is delicious in their biscuits
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:02.200]   So apparently buffalo wild wings and cracker barrel are now testing new chicken sandwiches
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:10.280]   McDonald's franchisees air calling on the corporate office to start developing a top tier chicken sandwich as its top priority
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.160]   Buffalo wild wings is trash
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:21.960]   The launch of a legend I we missed this. I didn't realize it's all gone. It's done. It's over
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.960]   Oh, yeah, I did want to go get one, but I'm not going to fight a crowd
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.400]   We've wiped out the entire chicken supply of the United States
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.960]   And it was I'm trying to find the story. It was one tweet from pop eyes
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.680]   against
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:43.160]   No, it was no, it was chick fillet responding to the pop eyes against pop eyes and then pop eyes response business insider
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.600]   Calls it the tweet heard around the world
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.880]   There you go
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.720]   All right, so I got the New York Times story. It's a good story here. I'll put it in the rundown
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.840]   Most early social media support of pop eyes chicken sandwich appears to have been a grass
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:07.080]   Rotes movement a rarity in the sea of influencers. Did Stacy make a funny and I missed it
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.560]   She'd know I asked us to get back on target
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:16.680]   Oh, this is Twitter. This is social Twitter. This is target internet. This is legit internet. Sure
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.320]   So that morning one of pop eyes fast food rivals chick fillet had tweeted what appeared to be a thinly veiled
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.080]   Subtweet you
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   I said a sub tweet
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.360]   It appeared on the official pop eyes account. So that then
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.560]   All the pop eyes responded. They had a big meeting
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.200]   I speak brainstorm
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.160]   Y'all good y'all good was the response y'all good
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.280]   Oh, that's cold
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.200]   So this is yeah, so there is a language
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.800]   Of social media now. I mean, I only just learned the phrase sub tweet a couple of weeks ago
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.480]   So this is all new to me from Brett Stevens. Yeah, no
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.080]   But it is handy now because of Brett steve
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.120]   and y'all good is like
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.160]   How we what is the what is a fray? It's not
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.400]   It's it's uh, it's kind of like a sub tweet too, but it's like
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.800]   God, I don't it's infra like a backhanded burned. Yeah backhanded burn
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:23.080]   But it's only yeah, it's only by inference like you can't you can't tell that they're talking to so clever
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.480]   it's shade
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.960]   after that sub tweet chick fillet went quiet
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.560]   But hashtag chicken sandwich moors
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.280]   Rose to the top
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:42.760]   Um, it's darn good. Why don't we all just was not pleased, but it's darn world we live in
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.760]   You know, I will say that my daughter
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.160]   In her friends are amazed that I speak quote unquote their language
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.400]   But I don't I only speak what I learned on twitter, right? So
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.640]   What I the time I spend on social media is mostly
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:04.200]   What allows me to quote unquote speak the language of the young's
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.040]   um, but and there's lots of research a lot of the
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.800]   language on twitter goes back to
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.120]   Black twitter and african-americans and we just kind of all co-opted and it's a really interesting can I tell you that's
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.440]   From the beginning of the world. Well, yes jazz
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.120]   Rock and roll kuleo daddy. Oh
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.040]   I mean, yeah all that all the jazz speak groovy
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.840]   It's it's you know what the most creative sector of the of america
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.120]   You know, I'm an extended. I was gonna say is african-americans. It's immigrants
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.120]   It's it's the subcultures that rise up under repression to create
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:51.160]   And it's us white men that reap the benefit when we capitalize on it with ad tech
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.520]   And teens are the most creative teens are great
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:03.800]   And they use whatever outlet they can use to be subversive and god bless them for that's the point is they don't they're trying to create something that
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:09.960]   The the the uh, old's don't know don't understand. I can't get like snap y'all good
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.000]   I like y'all good. I'll be using that
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.120]   That is a good phrase the passive aggressive chicken sandwich debate as one new article put it
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:27.240]   Meanwhile there were the there was the rush on the fake chicken at Kentucky fried chicken
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.320]   I mean, I didn't have my I didn't have a segue ready. I was like scrolling up to try to get into a
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.880]   Story
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.520]   Let me do an ad so we can regroup. Although. I'm kind of curious about what
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:46.120]   It's just like the burger king fake meat fake fake meat. They have shake shacks said
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.560]   Shake shacks that we have a chicken sandwich without the beef
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.080]   Good, huh? That's good. That's good marketing
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:58.760]   Can't look like how to drive stacy up the wall
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.480]   I thought this was a home for geeks and nerds. It is very nerdy
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.400]   Let's take a break. We're gonna come back. We're gonna do more and we're gonna give stacy chance to greek group and fight his
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.560]   That google story
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.680]   Meanwhile jeff and I will talk about weird punctuation
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:22.760]   Uh, no actually we're gonna talk about monday.com our sponsor monday.com helps teams manage work and meet deadlines
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:29.320]   But I love what's going on at monday.com. We started using it. I love it. It builds a culture of transparency
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.440]   No mystery everybody knows what's going on. We all work better together
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:40.760]   And I'll because it's so easy to use it's so easy to put all your core business activities in one place
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:46.840]   Everything from like things like high level roadmaps to very specific day-to-day tasks
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:52.760]   65 000 teams are using monday.com and loving it. It's one of those things where once you start using it you go
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   How do we ever do?
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.000]   without this
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.880]   You uh, they've got you start with these great templates. Although you can also build a board from scratch
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.160]   Either way you're gonna tailor it to exactly what you need
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.560]   You automate workflows. You can have reminders. You can have notifications
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.320]   You can upload files from dropbox or google drive or even right from your computer
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.240]   And it doesn't matter if it's a team a two or a team of two thousand
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.080]   It's perfect for any team of any size and
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:26.200]   Collaborate collaborating all over the world. We're all distributed teams these days and this is so great
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.720]   No more whiteboards meetings meetings meetings
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.840]   Momorx cell files. It's all in there
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:41.240]   There's no mystery, but the flexibility of this platform the capabilities of this platform make it the best tool you've ever used
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.040]   For getting things done monday.com keeps you on track families use it too by the way
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.520]   You can create accountability by assigning owners to keep track of who's doing what

[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   Oh
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.520]   All right, I found a good story for you. Okay, stece
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:05.960]   It's got everything. It's got infrastructure financing. It's got google. It's got internet of things and it's got
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.920]   private equity
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.760]   so
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.640]   The washi journal did a story about gudu alphabet
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:21.160]   subsidiary sidewalk labs getting together with the ontario teachers pension plan to launch an infrastructure holding company now
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   Sidewalks labs is controversial
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.840]   Because it's building this so-called smart city in part of toronto down by the waterfront
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.520]   That some people say is just a big invasion of privacy
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.240]   It's a big invasion of privacy and the citizens who live there won't have much decision
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:42.440]   To talk about it. What is really or should be pretty controversial about this is
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:47.240]   This new infrastructure investment company. It's not a fund
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.960]   It's going to be its own company that is going to lend money for
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:57.640]   civic infrastructure so things like roadways or
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.000]   Suet advanced water treatment plants
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.080]   What's crazy to me and I used to be a government bond reporter you guys
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.640]   Wow
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.000]   is
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.840]   this is
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.440]   They're going to invest in these projects for cities
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.720]   But they're going to choose the technology used and they're going to take a stake in that technology
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.800]   so
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.760]   If the government were doing this we would call that corruption because the government would be like
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.400]   Hey, yo, we're gonna you know
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.360]   We're gonna pick this vendor if they didn't do an rfp process
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.840]   I should say that and if they also had an investment in the company they chose through that our
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.920]   If you owned the golf course where the vice president stayed in ireland
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.360]   Yeah, it actually looks a lot like something like okay
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:55.000]   Except think investments in technology to improve your roads or to improve your life a long history of pension plans teachers pension plans cow
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.160]   Calpers
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:02.760]   Yes, and they invest in this sort of thing. There's it's a good investment and it's good for it's good for the state
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.320]   And it's a good investment for the teachers
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.520]   Yes, I know so there are plenty of
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:17.880]   Longed so pension funds actually are really stuck in a bind because they're trying to diversify out of just vc funds because those are getting later and later stage into other places
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:23.960]   And it's becoming more competitive to get into high performing funds because there's so many other
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.160]   Funds trying to get into them
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:35.720]   It's analogous to something like I don't know how to say it macaree. Do you guys know that fund? It's a giant infrastructure financing group
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.280]   So you're saying there's a conflict of interest here
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:44.760]   Because now the ontario teachers union is a part owner of the company that's doing the infrastructure right?
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.400]   Although that's how they profit
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.200]   Right
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   Okay, but
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:58.440]   I'm not sure if you're interested in the company that's going to be a part of the company that's doing the infrastructure
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.160]   Right
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   Although that's how they profit
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Right, okay, but
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.200]   Yes
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:15.960]   But as they finance these things, I mean this is these are projects that are designed to be and this also will depend on how you feel about things like
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:21.800]   Governments well, would you feel differently if it weren't the tarry o teacher's pension plan if it were just me
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:28.040]   Oh, no, no, I have the problem I have is with the infrastructure company that's financing these projects
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.600]   side is
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.880]   sidewalk and the company they've created is taking a
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.720]   technology stake in the company is taking a
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.000]   Financial stake in a company that they're choosing
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.400]   To implement the technology that's part of the project having an open bidding process
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:53.080]   But but yes, isn't that a better vetting process if i'm going to take a stake i'm going to do due diligence kind of like insider kind of dealing
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.600]   I mean
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.440]   I I would be I am very suspicious. I feel like as a reporter
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:03.160]   I would want to see all the records of something like this, especially when it goes in
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:10.040]   But it is it is something that is clearly happening so enough people are like, I don't know if this is a bad thing
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.240]   I would think that if i'm putting my pension fund
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:22.200]   In uh in a technology company that i'm gonna do i'm gonna even be more careful to make sure that they're up and up and we're gonna make money for us
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.760]   Infrastructure spot right now
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.560]   Yeah, are you funding infrastructure or are you funding new tech
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.560]   And if you're funding infas well, but if you're funding infrastructure your goal is to have it be
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   Awesome for the long term right right if you're funding tech that is built into this infrastructure
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.960]   I don't feel like these are these should not be part of the same
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.320]   you know what the real problem is
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.600]   I think is
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   Is the short-term thinking?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.320]   It's the mismatch between tech which is going to be on quarterly
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.640]   returns
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.000]   Versus infrastructure where you're talking. I want 20 years 30 years
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.440]   This infrastructure's got a kind of this bridge has to stand for a hundred years
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.360]   And the so the mismatch it's another case of a duration
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.240]   Duration mismatch where the tech company is only looking at well, how much money can I make in the next three months?
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.960]   Is that the problem?
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.040]   No, I guess nobody sees this as a problem. Yeah, you're the only one
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.000]   I'm gonna
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   Yeah, okay
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.720]   Anything to distract from chicken. Oh, I think this is a really big deal
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:39.880]   And I'm not explaining it well and that's because I'm a writer not a talker. So I'm trying to figure out the survey there
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.080]   Carson body Stacy explained over
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:52.760]   Whether or not us before is going to fix the the usbc problem. This is how bad it's got now karsten is trying to distract us
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.160]   Oh, no, no, are you all up on us before?
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.600]   God, I just want something to stay the same. I'm all up on usbc dongles
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.240]   You see that's a sign of getting old
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.760]   No, it's not it's a sign of like
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.360]   I'm fine with technological advancement. I am not fine with things killed like ports being killed by backwards in compatibility
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.640]   How about this?
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.720]   Happening every year on devices. I have to keep for three or four years if they're
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   uniting thunderbolt three
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.720]   and usb under usb four
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:37.240]   Will we eventually be able to buy a usbc cable at taco bell without checking
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:44.360]   Whether it can deliver power whether it's thunderbolt capable. No, it's are you nuts?
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:51.320]   I just I just want to be enough before standard to be a standard and not a quote-quote standard
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.880]   Right, the problem does that. I'm all on board. It won't and I'll tell you why because it's downward compatible
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.200]   So you'll never be able to look at a port
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.880]   And know what its capabilities are because it's got to support everything
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:10.840]   So you can still you'll still be able to look at a port that might just be usb three one and and and type c
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.600]   Or maybe this one. They are
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:21.880]   They are they are keeping the connector. Yes, that's the problem. See works. That's the problem. You can't you can't inspect the connector
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.960]   And say I know what this does and that's the whole problem. It's never going to get better
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.400]   So good luck karsten
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.840]   And we were talking about this on windows weekly because microsoft has for reasons no one fully understands on its surface
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.200]   Puts type c connectors, but doesn't support thunderbolt with them
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.400]   In fact, only recently supports charging with them
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.200]   In fact, they only recently put them on at all
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.120]   So and then the rumor is with microsoft is going to have an announcement october second of new surface devices and uh
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.600]   I think our experts marry jofoli and paul thorata windows weekly both agree
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Don't hold your breath for thunderbolt support on the new surface devices
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.480]   Which just keeps us in this silly
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:07.160]   You know downward spiral and there you go. There's an xkcd for everything by the way
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.200]   I felt kind of bad. We had a great interview with randalman roe on friday on triangulation
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.320]   And that's why I just put that screen up so you can plug it now
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:23.000]   Yeah, you should tune it in but I just wanted to tell you we did the interview shortly before it was revealed that his forums had been hacked
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.320]   And all the information leaked. I got I hope they weren't related events
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.680]   Um, so randal's scrambling a little bit today
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.960]   All week because uh they've had to shut down their forums on the xkcd.com site
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.200]   Whatever happened with the joeyito interview
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.640]   Cancelled because uh the media lab has decided to defer publisher of his book
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.280]   Until he is less of a hot property
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:54.680]   But everybody should still go to try twit.tv/try and watch the yes randalman roe. Yes. Yes. Yes. You have other
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:00.200]   He loves that man. Isn't he great and you know she will like him even more when she when she realizes
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.120]   What a sweetheart he is. He's not he's kind of what you would hope
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.600]   It's kind of that's not good for my kids. Any bearing like it with my daughter. No, I mean
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.360]   He's just like she is a dark individual right now. I know grow
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   she
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.120]   He was surprisingly
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.280]   I don't want to say naive but innocent sweet
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.720]   Really a great guy. I really enjoyed talking to him was such a thrill
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.440]   Um, danny Sullivan kind of in the caught in the middle in an unusual position
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.280]   He is the founder of course of search engine land and marketing engine land went to google
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.400]   went to google
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.960]   He's in a little twitter battle with duck duck go
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.160]   Duck duck go tweets most people know companies like google and facebook collected sell your data
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.080]   Yet some people think so what i've nothing to hide
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.440]   Here's five compelling reasons to tell them why your privacy
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:58.040]   Is worth more than you think kind of all of this conversation we just had hyper targeted ads propaganda and discrimination the filter bubble
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:03.160]   User data is saved and shared with third parties user data is sold to advertisers
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.880]   danny Sullivan
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.080]   responded
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.360]   well
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.360]   Regarding the filter bubble claim we don't at google manipulate your search results based on what we think you'll click on nor our search results
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.000]   different from someone doing the exact same search at the exact same time as the video claims
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.600]   And he said
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.560]   Another tweet this week duck duck go claimed google had a filter bubble
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.400]   I feel bad for danny because I does you think danny wants to be in this situation
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.800]   We used to have monocourse all the time. I love danny once he was started to go to went to work for google
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.600]   We kind of I keep I'm watching him to be on
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.280]   Thank you, he's king he keeps saying I really want to be on but i'm far too busy
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.360]   Yeah, i think google google may not watch the events like news guys where no danny tastes glee
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.480]   Um, some will say too much but I would disagree
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.160]   I love watching him because he takes glee and telling people where they're wrong
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.800]   Well, and he's right about the filter bubble issue, right?
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.520]   And by the way, here's another book to recommend
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:06.360]   Just received our filter bubbles reel by axel bronze. Guess what the conclusion is no
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.480]   No, no, i've read his papers
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.960]   Uh, and and I just got this
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:19.000]   Sullivan points to a new tool that automatically deletes location history and activity data
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.080]   Uh, he says I work for google search to help provide information about how we operate
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.360]   So i'm only speaking to this the part that's in my area the filter bubble part
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.720]   Someone related we do have new tools that lay people automatically delete
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.680]   Data and so i'm going to click on that link
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.840]   Auto delete controls for your location history and activity data
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:42.040]   Uh, this came out in may so we did report it at that time in the change log, but you can
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.520]   You could turn off
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.600]   You can say once an activity is older than three months old you can delete it
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.040]   And that's all built into my activity so
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.960]   um
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.360]   Keep for three months 18 months until i delete manually
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.080]   That's better than nothing
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.160]   Three months is maybe some would say too long
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.520]   My i have i have a firefox browser for uh that i use on iphone and android called focus
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.320]   That deletes the data so you
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:18.360]   As soon as you log out in fact i even get a notification on my phone that says click this to delete all your erase browsing history
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.280]   And so i could just pops up after i use it so
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.720]   There are ways to be a little more proactive i guess but not in google land
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.000]   Uh, not in google land and it's hard it's hard work when you have to
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.560]   When you move from the google world, everything is very convenient and then
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:44.200]   You have to piece this sort of functionality together using a couple different sites and you're never going to get quite there
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.920]   So and you have to remind yourself constantly like oh i'm supposed to do this. It's tough
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.800]   I'm not an instagram user did instagram uh follow up on deleting the like
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.320]   Oh
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.920]   I didn't notice
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   I do use instagram
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.800]   I
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.320]   Apparently facebook says yes, it may do the same
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:12.760]   Start hiding like accounts. I think there's a lot to be said for the fact that like accounts do drive a certain amount of
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:19.800]   Um weird behavior weird behavior. Yeah, but i think but but i don't in most cases it doesn't
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.080]   No, i'm normal people look at likes and go look i got 12 likes
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.360]   But it can't become addictive right
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:37.320]   Well, what also i like to do sometimes is on some things i'll see someone surprising like something and i want to see who all liked it
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.600]   Only because i think oh i didn't know they cared about that that's interesting
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:47.400]   So there is information there so this i guess instagram is testing it in seven countries not necessarily yours
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:53.800]   And uh and facebook says now um, we we're not going to do the same. We're going to try and test it
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.680]   Not live for all users test it
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:06.120]   And facebook declined to share results from its like hiding tests its exact motives already scheduled for starting testing
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.520]   Um, but i i think that's an interesting idea. It's like hiding follower counts on twitter
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.560]   It would very much change the platform wouldn't it
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:22.680]   But you know i when i started blogging i looked at my traffic every day i cared about it deeply
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:30.040]   Then after a time i just didn't give a darn anymore and the same for all the metrics that exist out there i just don't i don't i don't care
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.880]   But you're not trying to sell anything i mean i can say as someone who i personally do not care
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.840]   But as someone who's trying who's accountable to advertisers or who has been accountable to advertisers and editors
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.200]   Those things matter and if you're in a
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.400]   Rid of them stacy would you be opposed to getting rid of those i think people could then
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.920]   I i think it's nice to hide that kind of stuff. I think it does drive people to behave to do it for the likes kind of thing
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:05.080]   And i think it also would make it harder to be one of those influencers
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.840]   Um because you wouldn't have a way of necessarily tracking that
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.840]   um
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.520]   I think there's a lot of repercussions there, but i'd be i'd be for it
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.480]   I just generally think that you know playing whack-a-mole with information is not
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.920]   Always a good strategy and i tend to like more transparency
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.520]   Um
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:35.400]   I think it doesn't like so silly. I mean there's bots. There's no transfer. I mean, yeah, it's transparent, but it's stupid transparency
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.960]   It's like showing someone
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.800]   I think
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.240]   Yeah, it's like drawing on a map of the hurricanes
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.480]   Path with your sharpie to expand it into alabama's like that. Is that what you're saying?
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.560]   This is the this is not that has nothing to do with anything. This is the original
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.480]   but not related to this at all
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.520]   The important thing is that is that with his mind alone
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.880]   He changed the path of the hurricane as maryan
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.280]   We've got to give we've got to give a full credit as maryan williamson
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.000]   Suggested that the power of the mind can deter she's running for president too
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.920]   so
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   So she deleted a tweet that said
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.680]   Millions of us seeing dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.480]   It's a creative use of the power of the mind
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.600]   Two minutes of prayer visualization and meditation for those in the way of the storm
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.600]   But as you know, no tweets are ever deleted on the twitter
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.760]   You could delete your tweets. Yeah, but there's been somebody somebody's found somebody
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:48.520]   Oh, okay, I was like, yeah, oh, yeah, you could delete him, but they live on so then yasha lee from uh, I think from huffing and post
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.960]   Um
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.160]   tweeted that she had erased it and then she went on an attack against him all he said was she'd raised it
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:02.200]   And so then she defends herself from not being crazy, but if you have to defend yourself from not being crazy well
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.080]   You've already lost you've already lost
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:14.360]   I am not crazy. I am not let me let me quickly talk about my beautiful white teeth. This is not crazy
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.840]   This is thanks to this the crest

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:28.280]   I would you know at the health club. I was just the health club this morning do my workout in there for 199 dollars

[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.040]   They are cheaper, you know computers
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.240]   So i'm not surprised
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.520]   Uh, and red police planes google
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:28.120]   I don't know how you can play google. Yeah, it's just you you get what you pay for it's a net book that you nailed it
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.240]   Yeah
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.480]   If you're paying 200 dollars for for a laptop, it's not going to last as long
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.160]   My pixels by dying early do they mean that the hardware is bad? Then how do you blame google for that by dying early?
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   Do they mean it doesn't get updated?
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.520]   um
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:48.680]   Well, there is okay. So uh the hardware platform is developed by google the the mother board
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.760]   so
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   As andrew police says the ctl chrome book tab ta tx want
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:00.520]   And the asus ct 100 both use the scarlet baseboard
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.680]   This is well and I think part of their issue is some of these
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.320]   Devices are shipping
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:16.040]   But they're going to ship with less support than what was promised because they were actually built in support the clock on support for their internals and chrome
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.960]   Uh, their internals when they promised six years of update
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   it's six years from
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:29.400]   When that implementation platform was not religious. Yeah, the support cycle begins and google completes the hardware platform
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:34.680]   Um, which kind of sucks, but I also kind of get it because you can buy a machine
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:42.600]   Well, who keeps the computer for like that's a really interesting question is how long do you keep your laptop?
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.040]   How long do you expect?
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.960]   Is it every three years every five years?
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.240]   Well, they point out if you go to amazon you search for best chrome books
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.240]   You'll see the asus flip c 302 which is a great machine, but it is two years old
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:01.400]   So it's well into that life cycle and only has three years of update left now. I have to point out
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.040]   There are people on microsoft windows
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.920]   who are going to be
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.440]   out of life a year and a half because they can't update from
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.800]   windows 10 1803, which is the the spring update last year
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   for various hardware reasons
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:25.480]   and 1803 goes out of service you're not going to get updates if you don't upgrade in in a few months
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.240]   And that's less than two years. That's pretty darn quick
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.040]   That's yeah, so this is not in the business. This is not unusual
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:40.680]   apple will only uh update to katalina that's new operating system coming out next month probably
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.160]   uh systems that came out after
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.320]   2012. I mean that's seven years ago, but it says it's just what happens
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.200]   It's not unusual answer your questions. Stacy
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:55.960]   I I hold on to a laptop only until google gives us the next one
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:01.080]   So you're a little abnormal, but our pixel book is a great shape right now
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.640]   These were a thousand dollar laptops and they're all working well
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.520]   Uh, who is it comes in? I think it's he and tomsen comes in with it like the first pixel book
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.240]   And he said yeah, it's really on its last legs, but that thing is how many years old?
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   That's pretty old you mean the
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.840]   Slake great pixels. Yeah, the brand was different. What was it?
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:28.200]   Uh, I don't remember with the one that's kind of met gray metal dark gray metal not the newer lighter ones
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:33.000]   They did two generations of that one and they came out with the new pixel books. Yeah
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.080]   Well, I don't I don't know if I agree, uh, you know this article says something has to change
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.960]   I think this is pretty hard of course
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:49.880]   I would like and I think this is really important given security threats that every connected device be it your phone
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.960]   Which actually already has it comes with a sticker that explains when
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.360]   For that o s or whatever it's running on. That's a good idea
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:06.040]   And it should have not six years from date. It should have a june 20, you know 20
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.640]   And people can then that's why i'm more sanguine about the chrome books because these androids phones
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.960]   It's something like 40 percent of all android phones are still on lollipop
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:24.280]   So lollipop lollipop so we're I mean that's where there's a real problem. These devices are not secure anymore
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:34.120]   Well, I mean, but it is tough. I mean it's not like the average person doesn't necessarily know to look for
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.840]   Security updates supports like I I look it up in like the other day
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.960]   We the reason why we updated my daughter's phone is actually because apple announced that they weren't going to do patches for iphone sixes anymore
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   and that's what she's on and so
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:54.760]   That precipitated a change, but otherwise she'd probably still be on that phone. There is a certain kind of
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.440]   In my day, we kept a tv for 12 years. We kept a car for 15
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:07.480]   My refrigerator. It's not that anymore. This is this is just me saying consumers need to have they should know
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.160]   Yeah, if you're gonna if you're gonna build tech into a device
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:17.240]   You should know how long that tech is and we have to kind of understand it's not gonna last as long as your car and tv used to
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.680]   It's not
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.720]   So i'm sitting there on friday interviewing
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:31.000]   Randall Munro x kcd and all of a sudden people come running and say jack dorsey's twitter account has been hacked
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.040]   again
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.280]   This is I mean who cares, but it was the chuckling it was the chuckling
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:49.160]   This is saying people today hacked hit girls. Oh shocking now i'm upset
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:52.440]   What is hate girls?
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   Sorry hit girl
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:03.160]   Uh, I I call her hit girl because I cloyi Kardashian cloy grace morrettes is that how you say her name? I don't know is this on twitter
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.360]   Oh, okay. I know who you're talking about. Yeah
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   Hit got it from
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.560]   That other superhero movie
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.040]   No, other people are talking about
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.000]   So she was hacked on twitter
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.280]   She was her twitter account was hacked. Yes by the same people
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:28.040]   So the we think that jacks account was hacked by what we call simjacking which is absolutely a problem in the world
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.840]   people pretending to be jacked or see called his phone company and got and basically hijacked his cell phone number and
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.720]   Heat jack had been using a service twitter acquired nine years ago called cloudhopper
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.360]   Which lets you tweet from your phone via text message?
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.800]   It does not authenticate you though. It looks at your phone number and says oh, that's jack dorsey go ahead post the tweet
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.080]   And since they had his phone number they were able to tweet
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:56.680]   As jack dorsey for oh about 15 minutes before they got shut down
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.960]   So it's not a weakness of the phone system or twitter. It's a very big weakness of the phone system
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.280]   Yeah, same swapping the flip side to that is the flip side though
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.480]   If you make it too much more difficult people complain to the phone system because they can't recover their accounts
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.440]   Is this hard twitter has decided to disable?
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:20.520]   SMS tweeting as a result which is which was the whole beginning of the company. That's right
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.200]   It was what it was for originally was was with sms messages
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.840]   Uh, it was entirely disabled now. Yeah
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.320]   I mean that seems like a draconian response to having your ceos
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.160]   Do you know anyone who are going to be used sms tweeting? Yeah, I did
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:41.480]   Then you can also in the early days you can have incoming tweets via sms which really could be
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.000]   Oh, yeah, a lot of a lot of tweets. Yeah, I do
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.040]   via sms in the beginning. Yeah
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.960]   I didn't do all of it, but I definitely did a bunch of it. Yeah
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.760]   404 that was the short code
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.560]   Yeah, speaking of jack dorsey. I've got a different other question for you. Yeah
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:06.760]   I put a link up in the chat and the not the chat but in the uh, uh, run down. Yes, it's a fashion question
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:14.520]   Jack dorsey far right picture not the shoes. I don't care about the shoes the far right picture jacks long hoodie
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.400]   You think I want to see a question
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.920]   This you want to wear this because it's all black far right one. You like all black
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.280]   I think I can pull that off. I think I can pull that off that the long hoodie. Absolutely. Which this one probably
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.880]   Yeah, is that a hoodie?
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   Yeah, this one hoodie. Yeah
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440]   Yeah, you probably could
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.920]   He does anybody couldn't his head looks oddly large in that outfit doesn't his head look too big for his body in that outfit
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.920]   That's either the camera angle or he's trying to be a supermodel. Who knows
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:50.360]   Hmm. I think it's a camera angle and his beard and his hair his beard adds length and his hair heads
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:57.000]   Oh, that's it and the shadow behind his head. That's it. You're right. It's a trick a trump loy a trick of the eye
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.000]   Why is he holding a hammer with Justin Bieber? That's what I want to know. What's that all about?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.600]   I have a tent if I had a hammer
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:15.400]   Um, so yes, this was an article on mashable about jack dorsey's footwear evolution and investigation
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.160]   So if you ever complain about the kinds of things we cover on twig
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:25.880]   I know it could be worse. Hey, we have talked about a legit topic. I don't know what you're talking about
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:34.040]   I love my Austrian shoes on the show the geese fine the geese vine. Oh, yeah, I was like didn't we talk about like all birds or something?
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.040]   But yes the geese find yes we did
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.080]   Um
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.440]   It's a weird, you know the problem is folks
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:46.280]   I before the show I looked and I said weird week on the rundown like back from the holiday
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.040]   There was there it was it was there was nothing that kind of just screamed
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:56.600]   Talk about me here. It is, you know, the fine was good the the google's cookie sinking or supercoose
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.960]   Is good. Um, we could do the google change log
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.320]   It's time for
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:09.320]   Oh, you got him Stacy good work good. Oh, sorry karsten
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.400]   changelog
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.120]   But I was actually in the studio I saw that poor karsten has to like hit five buttons hold his elbow
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.680]   And and dance to get that to happen. I might have pointed out he doesn't have to
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   He
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.560]   Might but he's not required to it's not part of the overall is it maybe it is I don't know
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.880]   All he has to do I have to turn up the I have to turn up
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.240]   the the tricaster audio I have to push the the button I have to make sure it's
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.200]   Selected up here. It's it's a it's exhausted just thinking about it's a thing
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:57.160]   I want to go home. Is there not a back row we could build for you part that there are there are tds here
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.840]   Who are better at doing that part of the job? This is not what we heard
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.560]   This is not it's something that that that my hands don't do well
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.680]   it's again an artifact of my
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.560]   Vanity and hubris that I thought we should do streaming video of these shows
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.280]   Uh when it's completely unnecessary
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.680]   Like this is Kevin and I get requests for it like six people have asked Kevin and I only six
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:28.200]   Like I am capable of writing down every single topic topic we talk about as we talk about
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.760]   He's doing that right now and time code. No other td can do that. That's true
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.520]   You're you're exceptional with that
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.600]   But I can't I can't bring up videos
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.200]   For some reason I am incapable of bring up videos
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:46.040]   Like that's just something I can't do as can we make a uh like and all the other tds don't have a problem
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.880]   Let's take one of those uh those that was easy staples buttons
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.440]   And make it a changelog button and if we could do that that would be awesome
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.920]   Google planning big changes to the way chrome tabs work
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.560]   Adrian kingsley hues of zd net writes, but you might not notice
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:12.040]   Google's planning to carry out a major decluttering of tab options that users are presented when they when they right click on a tab in the chrome browser
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.320]   I
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.320]   The options used to be
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:21.720]   New tab close other tabs reopen closed window bookmark all tabs play the google changelog theme
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.480]   Those are now gone at least in canary
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.480]   But I bet no one notices
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.520]   So I mean it's a change
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.360]   And so hence it's in the google changelog
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.040]   Any questions?
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.400]   Google camera is they're made it they made a smart trade-off
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:48.520]   Uh on the pixel three and you may notice this on your brand new pixel three
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.280]   Uh when you uh when you look for
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.000]   It's on what
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.400]   It's three a i have a three a when you look for smart burst
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.200]   It's gone
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.200]   You'll find instead top shot
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:10.520]   It's not exactly the same but it's close enough that I don't think anybody's gonna really care about this one either
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.920]   Top shot is awesome. You can only get a few you know, you don't want to have too many choices in there
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.800]   Right
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.920]   So the google has decided to focus on the development of top shot which
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:27.560]   What it takes a number of pictures and then suggests the one that nobody's blinking in it does the same thing smart burst did
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.640]   It takes like 15 pictures at once
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.160]   Um, and then it just it automatically picks the thing
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:39.080]   It thinks is the best but then you can go back to it and and scroll through those 15 pictures
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:45.560]   And say no, I think so what did smart burst do um kind of the same thing basically
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:51.560]   So they had two things that did the same thing and they've decided to get rid of one of what google
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:56.280]   What why wouldn't they do that with messaging? Yeah, there was a message
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:03.880]   We didn't talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. We're not done yet. Uh, it could happen. I'm not saying it will. It just could
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.000]   um, so
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.760]   You can't uh smart burst did not let you manually set burst size
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.840]   Yeah smart burst was only like it
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:20.680]   It only decided for you. Yeah, and you could create animated gifts with it. Yeah
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:27.240]   It automatically it automatically created gifts and automatically picked things for you but turn it on
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:32.520]   I imagine they have better control. I imagine they have telemetry. So apparently nobody wanted it
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.960]   That's uh, if you have an older pixel phone you could continue to have
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.160]   Top uh smart burst because top shots can't be done on an older phone
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.360]   But pixel three three excel and I presume three a that you just got for your daughter
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.760]   Uh, we'll have now and another three a's for me the two is for her
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.680]   Oh, well, she will still have smart burst. So if you need smart burst
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.480]   You should run on over and borrow her phone
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.440]   Maybe maybe we'll take some pictures using both and see what the difference there you go. Would you do that for us?
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   Here's something for stacy
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.920]   The tensor flow machine learning framework for graphical data
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:14.440]   There was a bunch of words in there. I knew each the meaning of each individual one, but not the total
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.920]   sentence it makes
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:24.440]   So today google introduced neural structured learning an open source framework that uses the neural graph learning method for training neural networks
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.840]   With graphs as structured data
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.960]   It works with the tensor flow machine learning platform
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:35.160]   It is made to work for both experience and inexperienced machine learning practitioners
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.560]   You can throw a bunch of charts and visual data. I believe
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.480]   And sorry charts and structured data at
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:48.120]   Attends something that the tensor flow framework or whatever it is
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.920]   And it will tell you what you should it up and spit out intelligence
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.480]   Something like that
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:00.760]   New logos rebranding for android auto android one and android tv
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:05.000]   Again another change you just not gonna really care about or notice
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.280]   Even the change law even the change log is your knee
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.240]   We say wait there's actually some cool stuff. Okay or stay
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:20.760]   No, you guys. This is actually cool. So the uh your pixel
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.000]   phone
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.280]   Now actually can work with certain select hearing aids
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.840]   Android 10
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:33.320]   This is an android 10. Yeah, this is an nice feature. I actually use my
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:37.720]   Resound hearing aids on an iPhone because it has it those are mfi
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:44.520]   Hearing aids and so it's great because you could be walking around with your hearing aids in listening to an audiobook
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.560]   And no one knows any better or a baseball game or music
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.280]   What are you listening to? No Leo?
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.280]   Wouldn't you like you know?
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.800]   So uh no, yeah, that's uh, that's not that's a feature that iPhones had for some time
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   They have a lot of nice hearing aid technology android has been kind of hit or miss but this is a nice feature of android 10
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:09.320]   Yeah, we could you know what you're right. We did not put android 10 into the change log because we probably should
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.520]   because uh
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   Frankly the next change log is equally dumb which is google. No, I've got another good change law starts. Wait a minute starts auto playing videos later this month
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.800]   Oh
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.960]   Whoa, okay. Give us a better one
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:33.320]   Um gmail on g-suite. So only g-suite. I think can tell you if you set an out-in office
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.960]   In someone tries to email you and I think is it only your co-workers? I'm a little unclear on that
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.520]   It would be better if it's anyone
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520]   And when you start to email them
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:47.720]   Google will be like yo that person's on vacation. Yeah, and then you'll be like, oh, I shouldn't send them a message
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.800]   I thought that was pretty cool. You mean
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.680]   If you're not wait a minute let me get this straight
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:02.040]   Because what I really need is if I'm on vacation I can't send any email because I already set my vacation reminder
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.560]   That's not what you're saying. No, it's gonna. It's gonna let you sit. No, it's if I were gonna email you and you would set your email
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.560]   It will know and I'll say no, no, don't even bother. He's out exactly yeah, nice
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.240]   So for some people that means they will actually get fewer emails finally something in the change log
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:25.160]   Well, I care about as I get fewer. Oh, oh, oh and you Jeff will get fewer. I can't stand that
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.360]   I did see another change today. I I updated chrome and then it has said
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:35.000]   It went to the cat I did two things one. It said there was a new sign in
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.400]   For the admin of all of my accounts for one page I had to update them
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.960]   And then two I went to calendar and it said oh we can we can show everybody who you shared your calendar with
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.920]   Your normal working days. I said no no don't do that
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.560]   So it can know when they can bug you no
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.760]   No, don't do that
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:03.960]   I said google no, but it was new it's changed log that would that would out me in a lot of ways
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.720]   Yeah, like my working hours are not necessarily the working hours you might expect me to have
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:17.560]   Google calendar speaking of working hours makes working hours more prominent. Wait, is this what you're just talking about? Yes, so
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.120]   Yes, it is
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.720]   Speaking of what you were just double dipping on the google change
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.360]   Just trying to fill it out that in the change log no, it's not
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.320]   We were
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   We were
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:39.000]   Somebody didn't put it in I didn't put anything in the change log this week. I was so lazy
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.400]   I was so lazy. That's a good one working hours
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:51.880]   Okay, all right. Well, we may have achieved all of our goals with this show so far. I don't have finished
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.600]   the google change log
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.360]   It is done
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.440]   Goodness. It is done. It is done
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.040]   Are there any other stories before we go to the bottom and uh
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:06.600]   And get our picks of the week any other stories that we have missed that you
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.160]   fellas
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:15.880]   And I mean by fellas you guys say fella or guys anymore. What do you say y'all?
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.200]   That y'all can we use dudes? I like dude. So
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.840]   Dudes is not not gendered. Oh
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.960]   Y'all it is it is standard
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.440]   Y'all actually arson, you know why we don't have in english a collective
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:38.040]   Uh you are you we have y'all used to be used to be the and thou
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.640]   But now we got you and y'all
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.080]   You and y'all. Yes. Y'all. Y'all. Y'all. It's now y'all. Okay
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:54.200]   Um, is it you a collective you it is you and you it's undistinguished. You see what i'm saying?
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:57.000]   It's just you and you in french
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.640]   It's it's french. It's it's too and vous but in in english is you and you unless you use y'all
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:10.680]   And y'all I am ready to wrap this out y'all good. Y'all good
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]   I
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:17.000]   Well, I got a question for you. I got a question for you
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.280]   should a oc
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.960]   If trump legally cannot lock people because he's the president of the united states on twitter
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.680]   Isn't a member of congress just is the same thing
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.840]   But she's getting horribly harassed by some really awful characters. Don't you think president trump is getting horribly harassed
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.840]   Doesn't read it to her. Well, so that's not
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.560]   Neither here. She actually responds
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:47.160]   Should it be the law that she can't block someone should that be the case? Is that is that a legitimate?
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.280]   You the court rule that president trump could not
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.680]   Yeah, but he you should be able to block people who are sending you
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.520]   Incredibly offensive you should and I should
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.240]   And no even a member of congress should but a member of congress has a right as a
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:08.680]   obligation to listen to the spots if there's maybe when you're not allowed to
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:15.880]   I get that but what i'm saying is what if you had before you could block someone you had to prove that they were
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:19.720]   Horrifying and you would go to maybe it's a federal judge
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.120]   Here's they're not doing anything else right? Well, here's okay
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.200]   Let's add a little thing in here because according to rolling in our chat room
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.720]   She does not block anybody from her district abusive or not
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.440]   She only blocks people who are not her constituents
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.600]   That changes it a little bit doesn't that that might be legal. I think I think she has the right to block
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:46.040]   People who are not her constituency. Yes, the thing about the president is we're all his constituency
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.200]   But she is elected representative from the Bronx
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:54.760]   So she should not be able to block constituency. They should have the right to speak to her, but nobody else
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:01.480]   I think that there you go and answer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The problem problem is then she has to track
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440]   who's
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:11.640]   Who's treating at her? That's true. That means she's only blocked like seven people. Yeah, so she has to track who's an a-hole
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.440]   That's a little bit easy, but maybe they're in her constituency. I don't know
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.280]   But there's seven people she's got to figure out they're russians anyway
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.160]   Are they russians really?
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.240]   Oh, yeah, you think yeah, well, she should be able to block anybody from outside the US
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:31.960]   And any sock puppets or bots, she's be able to block them
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.360]   They should have to be real people
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:42.280]   Oh, well, I don't have to worry about that. Let's take a break and you oh there goes Stacy
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.160]   I knew she wasn't gonna make it through the whole show
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.680]   We grabbed her out. We're gonna be back to this
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:55.160]   That's the saddest sound in the world. She couldn't stand with sky and grammar. Hang up much for her
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.920]   Uh, we will come back with your picks of the week and maybe if we can get Stacy back her thing of the week
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.520]   But first a word from epsan. This is my pick of the week
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.960]   You can kiss expensive ink cartridges. Goodbye epsan's eco tank wireless
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.520]   color printers their own ones
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.920]   have super tanks
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.320]   With up to two years of ink in the tank it comes with the printer
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:25.400]   Enough to print thousands of pages and then when you go to the store to get more ink and these bottles are great because they're keyed
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.520]   You can't misuse them. They they'll they only can fit and it's easy to use you get another two years of ink
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.800]   So when you go to the store in 2021 to get more ink
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.200]   You could say i'll see you in 2023. I love this
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:47.960]   We have two at home. I like them so much with a super sized easy to fill ink tanks eco tank printers means fewer trips to the store
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.440]   Less frustration for you
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.920]   epsan wants your printing experience to be stress free and easy and you know I like epsan
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.240]   I've always had a thing for epsan because my first printer was an epsan member the dot matrix
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.200]   Aren't printers and they've just gotten better and better and these eco tank printers are so sweet
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.360]   I I probably do as much scanning with my eco tank as I do printing
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.760]   It's so awesome

[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.360]   this week in google
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.880]   Speaking of epsan printers. I was standing there in the airport as I do a lot
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.480]   And i'm looking at the folks behind the behind the counter or the gate
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.120]   And of course they have they have a dot matrix printer there. Yeah, spewing out the
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.600]   Passenger listen stuff, right?
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.240]   Where the heck do you buy a dot matrix printer anymore? Can you?
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.080]   I don't know
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.680]   Industrial stuff maybe yeah, maybe maybe I wonder if
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.400]   They do that because it's a special form or something that they're printing no it's not a form
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.480]   It's just it's just it doesn't feed multiple sheets. It's a sheet. It's a man. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.720]   Do you think they just feel the price it with a nice
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.720]   I have a
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.480]   Canon
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.600]   copier
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.960]   that is
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.480]   16 years old
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:59.480]   You can still buy a google shopping is that is that a tractor? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.480]   I have some dot matrix. Wow
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:06.520]   They're so noisy. Why would you want can you buy the paper too? Sure. I guess it's hard to fall
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:13.640]   Oh my parents might yeah, I remember the dot matrix the sound of the dot matrix my
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.600]   Oh, that's a lot. Yes. Oh, I was a kid. No, I was a lot. See
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.720]   jeez sorry
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.440]   It's okay. I'm used to it now
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:31.240]   Did you ever see that video of like it was 24 if it had been shot in like 1998 or 99
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.880]   Or maybe it was like 1991 cell phones and the dot matrix printers. Yeah, so he's like, okay
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.840]   Send me the information. Okay. We're waiting to print it out in here
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.120]   Maxes on its way
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.200]   You know for people from our generation stacey
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:54.920]   That's that's not amusing. We remember those days. Yes. Yeah, I remember them too. See I just was younger
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.560]   I just wasn't trying to function in the workplace
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.760]   See now stacey you're starting this back in on the history of word processing
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.480]   Oh god, I gotta get that book
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:10.920]   Stacy, what's your thing this week? Oh, I have a great one. You guys are gonna love it
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.200]   Um, I was gonna do roomy, which is a new sensor out, but I'm gonna do that next week after I get one
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.680]   so stay tuned for that but
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:24.280]   Oh, um, I've forgotten it your things dot info
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:29.320]   My thing is your things. That's right. My thing is your things dot com or a dot org. Sorry
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:34.040]   Let me let me pull that up dot info dot info gosh
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.360]   Scorecards
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.800]   I'm doing this all again. Your things dot info
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.960]   This is a project from you and see chapel hill and georgia tech
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:52.120]   So two very legit organizations have done a review of about 75 or 74 smart home devices
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:58.280]   They've only posted the scorecards for about 40 something of them, but they're your popular ones
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.960]   You've got belkin
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.320]   Wemo you've got our low stuff. You've got bo's
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.160]   Sonos
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.160]   Amazon echo google gears
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.160]   rocus
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.560]   Smart things and what they've done is they've done a device grade
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.200]   Um, so and that's related to
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:22.520]   Characteristics of security on the device. They've done it for the mobile networks and for the cloud
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.480]   Uh capabilities. I don't really know
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:31.800]   The cloud endpoints so like where are they sending data? What are the TLS configurations?
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.280]   They've also graded it on its network communication. So is it encrypted?
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.200]   What kind of protocols are they using are they susceptible to man in the middle attacks?
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.760]   So you can go and look up your devices. You can look up how they scored
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:47.240]   I was kind of surprised by some of them
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:53.560]   And I just thought this was a really and I would encourage you to do so and even before you buy a new device
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.200]   I would encourage you to go and be like hello
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:03.080]   Are you a good device to have in my house? Why or why not if you were going to pick one of the four grades device mobile clouder network?
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.080]   Which do you think is the most important?
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.120]   This is really tough because like it kind of depends on what you want the device to do
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.600]   What's interesting is that you can get things that are really high in one category and terrible in another category
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:23.640]   Yeah, and like I was like sonos got an F for I think it was network connectivity
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.880]   And some of these are design decisions
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.760]   I think
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.400]   And this is why security for these things is so tough because some of these decisions make sense within the context of what
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.840]   Is likely to happen like what you're likely using it for
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.600]   And so it's very hard to be like, oh, this is terrible
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.560]   There is not one device in this list so far that it has an a in every category
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.120]   Canary is the closest
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:56.760]   Which does not surprise me. Yeah, what is yeah, tell me about what's canary again canary is a all-in-one home security device
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.760]   So it's one of those yeah
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:02.120]   Is it the things canary?
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.080]   No, no
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:09.320]   Canary it's uh, it's not the canary we advertise for them thinks it's a different product
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.560]   I don't know what that product is so i'm gonna guess no if you google canary
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.320]   That's an enterprise security device. So I don't oh, yeah, no, this is this is a
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   Siren and motion sensor and oh, I remember the canary. Yeah, it's a little tower thing. Yeah, yeah
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.120]   Yeah, all right. Yeah, it gets a high score. That's nice
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:29.400]   I've searched for it and I found the canary islands
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.960]   Also lovely. Also, I don't know how secure those are
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:40.520]   It is not in fact it's uh, it's not an SSL site at all connection is not secure to the canary islands
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.840]   But for example your google home
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:50.280]   It's cloud is super secure, right as you might expect because it's google so it's behaving well the device score is only
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:56.600]   78 wow and the mobile app score is only a 69
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:03.720]   And the network score is horrifying because probably it's not encryption. They got a device just called chinese webcam
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.280]   Yeah, I didn't like that one
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.400]   I we don't know anything about it. It's just a chinese webcam, but it did not do well as you might imagine
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.720]   This is good. This is very useful stuff
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.240]   I like it. So I thought you guys would appreciate your audience all of you guys
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:25.960]   Y'all y'all I thought y'all would appreciate y'all we're gonna start saying y'all we're gonna make y'all
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:32.920]   Be the new lingua franca, please do y'all is great y'all good y'all good
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.480]   Jeff Jarvis y'all good your number of the week
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.040]   Uh, it was hard to find a number of this week too, but I finally found one
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:48.520]   Uh, one of the more interesting but actually kind of useless technologies people talked about is project jacar
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.160]   Oh, yeah, which is uh controls built into fabric. They had a levi's jacket
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:56.280]   They have an available and something else now in a backpack
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:01.240]   You think that would make people all kinds of happy geeks can get it, but it says eve salar
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.240]   Backpack. Uh-oh
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:06.680]   Uh, the cost eight hundred eighty dollars. Yikes. And what can I do with it?
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:12.280]   It's not a backpack that costs eight hundred eighty dollars. Just not it's a backpack strap
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.120]   Worse you have to
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.320]   Worse. Oh my god
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.320]   You can you can put that on your other backpacks, right? Any backpack you want?
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.880]   All right, so it's it's interoperable
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.320]   It's interoperable. Well worth it
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:34.440]   backpack strap
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440]   Wow, it has a usb port
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.240]   There's a jacar dongle
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:45.800]   Wow, so you can stroke up stroke down tap or or cover
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:53.320]   To do things on your I like this we're gonna see this in more places where it's good the costs are gonna come down
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.720]   They're just playing with it. I put a hope so
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:00.360]   I think about having more think about having
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.720]   Another interaction paradigm
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:11.400]   I said that word on that you can use when your hands are not full but like when you don't want to pull out your smartphone
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.960]   Yeah, but and I will tell you it's kind of a limited
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.200]   Totally a functionality. Oh look so
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:26.920]   So what I could make this I could make this volume up volume down pause play. Can I tell you what my bicycle helmet does
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:33.880]   So I have a laval bicycle helmet, which I love l i v a l l
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.120]   And it has a little dongle a little thing you attached to your handlebars
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.320]   That has multi functionality you pair it to your phone. It's bluetooth enabled helmet
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.040]   You pair it to your phone
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.000]   And it has a left turn signal a right turn signal volume up volume down
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.560]   Start stop take a picture launch the smart agent all in one tiny little button
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:02.120]   That's the kind of function and it's not $800
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:07.960]   That's the kind of functionality you want. I can answer the phone. I can I mean this thing is amazing
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:15.880]   So there I think this is overpriced this this jackpot. Yeah, I agree with you. Yeah
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:20.120]   Um, I even if you're looking for a large alert get the helmet
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:25.000]   Or or you can get the uh facebook
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.680]   What's your call it portal on sale on amazon right now for 70 bucks off?
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.040]   I thought it was gonna be for 70 bucks then I would have plots
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.480]   I spent so much money on those two portals. I think 600 bucks total for two portals
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.720]   Pre you and your mother?
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:46.600]   No, we ended up not getting used at all and it's just sitting there and berg's taking it apart
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.320]   It's $130
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:54.840]   It's now down to 130, but that's the 199 one. That's the the smaller one. I got the big tall ones
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:59.880]   So here just so just so you know what this multi function button looks like it's right there
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.080]   Oh, it's on the bike. Oh, I see it's on your handlebar to press left for left turn right for right turn
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.080]   Press the red button to start and stop music
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:13.240]   Bottom button Siri or google assistant top button camera up and down buttons volume up and down
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.480]   I think that's pretty good and just a simple device
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.520]   That is about you know, so it's only about that big by the way. I love my helmet
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.560]   And it and it lights up as i'm driving down the street
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.680]   So people won't hit me people can see Leo coming you could see me coming
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.720]   I'm bling bling all the way. They actually call it the bling helmet
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:38.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of twig for the week
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:44.440]   Uh, I I think we'll have more to talk about next week. I'm just hoping I will
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.680]   Yes the apple event and what else is happening next week?
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.000]   The apple event I won't be here because I'm going to
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.720]   the uh pod fronts
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:56.440]   Oh in san francisco, you know up fronts jeff knows it up front
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:00.040]   Sarts where the networks bring their shows and their stars and show advertisers
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.440]   They say please buy us for the next year
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:07.960]   Podcasting as a similar thing though. I went a couple of years ago to new york's the pod fronts
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:12.760]   I be does these and i'm going into san francisco, uh to the pod fronts
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.560]   So I won't be here. So it'll be jason howl next week
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:18.360]   But I will return them week following
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.400]   Stacey will also not be here sadly next week
