[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Twig this weekend. Google, Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacey has the day off
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   of Matthew Ingram's filling in. Lots to talk about. Google and Apple's plan is about to roll
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.880]   out for contact tracing. A couple of universities say we can reopen in September as long as we
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.160]   lock students in. Is that a good idea? And bye-bye to Schulace, the Google social network nobody
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.040]   ever heard of. It's all coming up next on Twig. This weekend Google comes to you from Twit's

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.000]   verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse with the Craig Newmark.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   The dad. Craig Newmark guy. The professor, the Craig Newmark professor of entrepreneurial
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.520]   journalism at the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.800]   There's entrepreneurial journalism in there somewhere. Mr. Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.080]   farm a TV deck, credit. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah. And college DJ. Hello, Jeff. How's everything?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   College DJ. How's everything in your neck of the New Jersey? We're doing all right over here.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   We're doing all right. Family range. That's three days.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.920]   Families well, everybody's feeling good. We're doing all right now. Good. And we know Stacey's
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.520]   not here. It's Botox time in the spring. So we brought in Mandy Potentkin, the star of Homeland.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   It's actually Matthew Ingram, chief digital writer at CJR, the Columbia journalism review. CJR.org.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.040]   Hi, Matthew. How you doing? I've been really enjoying your Instagram posts. Or is it Facebook?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760]   Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Both. Yeah.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360]   Now that you're on Facebook. See what you see what benefits there are.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   I'm leaving Facebook the minute this is over. But I'm good. We'll see you here for the next three
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.320]   years. I know. But it's kind of replaced in social contact for me. And then so there is a value
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.880]   to Facebook. There's a real value to you. Matthew, how do you trim the beard? It's good looking beard.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.960]   I don't do it well. You don't. It's just you don't trim the beard at all.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.320]   I mean, now and then I mean a little bit, but I kind of just been a little bit.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   Looks good. It really is has that has that Mandy Potentkin look to it. It's really really nice.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   It's really good. I'm debating. I'm really debating getting the beard trimmer at the highest and just
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   doing it. Man, I'm tempted to my hair is getting so out of control.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   Today, you got a real Don Johnson thing going. Yeah.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.080]   Today, normally I part it on the left, but you can't you can't part it on the left when it's
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.120]   lengthy because then it's weird. So I part it in the middle, which gives it that Michael Douglas,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.960]   Don Johnson kind of. Are you going for the man bun? You want it to be sort of man bun length?
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.840]   Yeah. It's either that or professor Irwin Corey. I don't know.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   Little Staccosky Johnson. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can be a conductor. Yeah.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.640]   I'll have a follow with it. I've always wanted to have long hair and I never had it. And so I
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.440]   thought it'd be kind of fun. I don't know. I might be man bunning.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.200]   Only the privacy of my own home because there's like enough now. I think people throw blood on you
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.680]   if you go out and bubble the man. I do make certain assumptions. Yeah. It's not a good look.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   So but ponytail. I've really always wanted a ponytail. So maybe I'll have a ponytail. Also a
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.600]   bad look, but you know, my parents in the 60s hated long hair. The worst fights we got into my
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.400]   entire child and they send me the humiliation. I would leave getting my haircut. They would send
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.240]   me back to get more cut off. Nice. That's awful. Oh, that's see, I didn't have that kind of your
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.080]   parents were clearly Nixon Republicans. Yeah, exactly. Go water. Go water. Even worse. Yeah.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.360]   We're better. We're doing a communist professor. Yeah. Yeah. I went over to the base. We lived on
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.920]   their force base. And I got number two all over. Yeah. Oh, wow. My when when Henry, my son,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.400]   who's now 25, was like two or three. I took him to a barber who clearly had worked with recruits
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.440]   in the army base. Because he took out the and I wasn't paying close attention. He took out the
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.360]   it went, geez, Henry smelled like a machine oil at the end of it and had little time. And I brought
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:37.440]   him home and Jennifer just burst into tears. It was it worked. It worked. Yeah, it did. I wasn't.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.120]   No, I wasn't aiming for that. I was trying to have a manly experience with him as a child. I did see
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.360]   somebody I didn't know that they really stole sold them. I saw on Instagram this week, somebody
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.560]   did have a flow be and used it. Oh, yeah. I can't imagine that that gives you too good. It's terrible.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.480]   No, that's good. That's basically a vacuum hose attached to a clipper. Right? Yes. Yes.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:08.480]   Yeah, I don't want to I don't know. I mean, I'm craving a haircut, but it might just be that
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.000]   intermediate stage you sometimes get at when you, you know, like with a beard where it's a little
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.960]   itchy, but if I could just push through, I don't know. I don't think pushing through is going to
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   do anything for me here. It's like, yeah, just getting worse and worse and worse. At least we
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.160]   didn't die our hero. Hey, at least we're old guys. Yes. Yes. There are a number of real guys.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:45.040]   Number of women I know who are a little unhappy with events. So to speak. So, Matthew, how are
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   things you're in Ottawa? No, actually, I'm just North of Toronto, Toronto. But you do have baby
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:01.920]   lambs. I was blown away by how they are. They are amazing. Yeah. We have one, my daughter,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.840]   youngest daughter is with us and she's a bottle feeding him. And then he cuddles up with her and
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.240]   has a little snooze in her arm. Cool. And it's pretty much the cutest thing you've ever seen,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   probably. If you follow Matthew on Instagram or Facebook, you will see these amazing pictures
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:29.040]   of Lammykins. There's something else. When I post them, people I don't even know are like,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.600]   thank you. Thank you for the lambs. This is getting me through my day of looking at your lambs.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.720]   Yeah. It's a public service, really. No, it is because, and I thought this that
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   seeing nature continue normally is a really nice way to remind yourself.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   Another way to look at it is if only we were here, think how happy they'd all be.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.400]   Well, they wouldn't be being bottle fed. So, yeah. Well, that's true. But one of them would be
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.440]   stocking up at the, I got to make a political comment. I can't help myself. So, the White House
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.920]   is going to support the Defense Act for baking, but not for tests. Yeah. Well, it's more important.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.520]   I mean, I get the bacon. It's a priority. It is a priority. I feel really bad
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.440]   for the meat workers, many of whom are immigrants who are forced to shoulder to shoulder in a very
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.880]   dangerous environment. And of course, because there's unemployment, it doesn't seem to be working out
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.120]   too well either. They may just have to go and say, look, I'm going to try to survive this. I'm
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.520]   sorry, but I need to do it for my family. And that just breaks my heart. I could live without
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:48.960]   pork products for a while. It'll be okay. All right. Let's talk about, you know, actually, we,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:58.160]   God, my hair is terrible. I'm sorry. Yeah. Men aren't vain. No.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:05.920]   That looks good. It's silver fox. Look, silver fox. Thank you. Go with it. Do you use anything on it, Leo?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.920]   shampoo. I use that. I use the no, no, no, I never did this, but the Harry's
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.480]   razor has a hair goop. Oh, yeah, that's good. That's good. You use that? I use that. All right.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.520]   I feel like goop because it makes me my hair feel like it's greasy. No, but it feels a little
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.320]   spiky for about an hour and then it stops. That'll be okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is this is,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.480]   this is our version of Vogue people. I have beard products. Yeah. Yeah. When I was
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.240]   going to grow a beard, I got everything yellow wax got the little tiny brush, got the, got the
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.480]   beard all the way. Oh, I got all that stuff. Now I have it. I don't know what I can do with it.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:54.000]   I guess I should keep it in case, you know, there's a razor shortage or something. Do you ever pull
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.800]   out pictures yourself from the near as even and consider? Oh, no, never going to show my head again.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.400]   Lisa would kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me. All right. Let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.440]   According to the Wall Street Journal, he is asserting control of Facebook, pushing aside
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   dissenters. He, the board of directors basically had not quite 100% turnover, but significant turnover.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.120]   And he is back, baby. I didn't realize he'd settled, settled back in his armchair,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   but he's sitting forward right now leaning in. What does that mean? Is this because
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.320]   of the troubles Facebook had prior to COVID where they were getting, see, I feel like I'm betting
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.160]   this had to take time. Yeah. Because I feel like now, even I'm on Facebook now, nobody's
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.400]   nobody's hating on Facebook because it's the only way we know what's going on with our family.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:53.920]   Right. I mean, realistically, Mark Zuckerberg controlled Facebook always for and he can
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.840]   hold it now. He controlled the board before he controls it now. He controls all the voting
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.720]   shares that matter. He's got proxies for board votes. I'm not sure that this is really going to
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.200]   make a big difference in terms of the actual management of Facebook. I don't know whether
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.520]   he just wanted to move around, but I don't think it was an irritation.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.840]   Right, Matthew, I think for him. Yeah. Yeah. But but Peter Teal's still there, right?
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.200]   Oh, I don't know. Erskine Bowles is gone. Reed Hastings is gone. These are two board members.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:36.160]   Susan Desmond Hellman left last October. She was the lead independent director. She's
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.680]   Facebook said she was leaving for health and family reasons. This is back last October.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:48.400]   Then she went to Pfizer's board. So maybe her health is better. It doesn't seem like,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.160]   I mean, you're right. He never gave up control, but apparently, according to the Wall Street
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.920]   Journal, it's odd that they're putting this out today. I don't know what happened.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.480]   But apparently he had relied on Cheryl Sandberg, the operating officer
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.040]   to handle policy and operational issues. Chris Cox, the chief product officer,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:12.560]   longtime friend to oversee the platform. But starting in 2018, he took on the role of a wartime
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.600]   leader. Now it's a series of products that took Facebook in new directions, starting with,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.240]   gosh, has it been now a year since he announced the private encrypted messaging?
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.360]   Same. Have they done anything in that direction at all? No.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:36.160]   I think they're moving it, like rolling it out. But you know, it's interesting.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.520]   There's just for the sake of argument, just to play Leo for a second.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.920]   And please do. I'm tired of being Leo.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.000]   Oh, let me do my hair today. There, there, I look like Leo.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.240]   That's the problem. Now I can't look at myself in the camera and know which side I'm pushing down.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   Okay. Anyway, so everybody thought, Oh, Mark Zuckerberg, he's just a nasty little
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.320]   crapper and all the problems are him. What if that wasn't the case? What if he delegated just
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.560]   just the second argument, just to be contrarian? What if actually he delegated too much?
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.880]   And he really does have the vision for the place. And it was like Michael Dell, when Dell went down,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   Dell had to come back and say, I'm in charge again. And he fixed the company.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   Yes. Maybe there are presidents for this, aren't they?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.560]   So what is just the sake of argument? I'm just wondering if you just give me a chance here.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.600]   Give me a chance. Okay. What if, you know, I like Chris Cox and, you know, I'm sure I'm not,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.960]   I'm not, I'm not getting guests, people who were delegated to, but, but not only that,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.360]   other people in charge of the newsfeed have changed, I mean, this security just changed,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.720]   tons of things just changed. What if young Zuckerberg delegated too much?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:58.880]   And what if he does have an vision for the place and now that it's loved for at least a few months,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.640]   maybe there is a chance. Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.680]   Try it. So I would just disagree with that fundamentally. I don't think, I mean,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:17.200]   I don't know Mark Zuckerberg, but everything I've read about him and all the people I've talked to
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   do know something about him, he doesn't delegate in the traditional sense of the word. So he is
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.840]   intimately involved in all the major decisions that either come from him or managed by him.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.400]   So I don't see him as being the kind of guy who would say, well, why don't you take over the
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.240]   newsfeed or the encryption thing and just get back to me and I'll, you know, go off and do
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   something else. That's just not the way he operates as far as I know. So New York Times today had a
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   story that they have restructured their security team. In fact, displacing more than two dozen
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:03.520]   employees. The security team has been kind of in a furore since Alex Stamos left over the Cambridge
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.000]   Analytica revelations. That was two years ago. Alex Zoom fixer Stamos. Zoom fixer Stamos.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.800]   So apparently there was a lot of infighting according to the Times. So Facebook has dissolved
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.120]   and dispersed its security group over the last two years. The latest cuts are part of a change
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.320]   in philosophy on security efforts spurred by infighting and long running issues within the
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:32.880]   department. New York Times quoting unnamed sources within Facebook. But it sounds as if
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.400]   here's the company Spokeswoman who gave a statement at the times, they're going to go
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.680]   automated to stay ahead of evolving security threats. We're investing more in automated detection.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.920]   That never goes well and bringing in new skills as we continue to grow our security team all over.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.280]   We're growing all over. I am, but that's mostly because I am too many crumpets. This also means
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.520]   we're restructuring a portion of our team and helping the people affected by this change
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.800]   find other roles at Facebook. So there is a, this is, this is, I would guess, you know, if this is
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.640]   happening all of a sudden this, this is related to the Wall Street Journal's report that Mark is,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.760]   the zuck is back. I think it's, I think it's a fallout from what happened with Stamos too though.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:24.720]   I know that Facebook has disputed this characterization, but my impression of what happened is that Alex
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   wanted to raise the alarm about what the Russians were doing and they went let him.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.240]   Yeah, and they went badly.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   Although trouble for raising too much.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.040]   You know, on the other hand, remember, Stamos's previous job was at Yahoo, where he quit because
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.320]   he said they never told me about this billion record breach. And how can I work somewhere where
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.040]   they don't keep me in the loop? Maybe it's legit. Maybe this poor guy just has jumped from one job,
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.800]   bad job to another. I don't know. But it's kind of, that's twice now he claims that I don't know
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.120]   anything. I wasn't in the loop.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.920]   So the Yahoo thing rings like that rings true to me.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.760]   Yeah, no, I think they did do it because Yahoo, remember Marissa Meyer didn't even tell Verizon
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.680]   during the due diligence prior to Verizon buying Yahoo.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.080]   That's right.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   Didn't even tell her them. That's classic.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.440]   Verizon was so pissed. They said, wait, give us some money back. That's not
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.000]   classic. Yeah. So if they didn't tell Verizon they're
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.680]   suiter, then I could see how they might have not told us had a security.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.360]   And nobody's denied this.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.800]   This restructuring is to kind of de-emphasize the power of that position that Stamos used to hold.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.160]   Maybe he had a whole department.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.640]   Right.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.440]   And he was, you know,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.320]   Yeah, it was all under him.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.440]   And then he left.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:39.680]   Right.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.560]   Years ago, and it kind of,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.080]   it's so funny though that, I mean, COVID's changed so many.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.920]   Everything. Life has changed. It's a new world.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.160]   Yep.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.280]   We're on a different timeline.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.240]   But among other things, all the criticisms of Google, Facebook,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.920]   you know, the tech lash, who's got time for tech lash?
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   We got, we, right.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.320]   In fact, people are now embracing Google and Apple because, in fact,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.120]   it's going to go on your phones tomorrow, kids, the new AP.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.000]   Was it tomorrow?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.560]   Oh,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.520]   May 1st.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.560]   So it's Friday. Yeah.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   So what's happening in Germany, even Germany switched and is now in the Google
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.440]   app.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.760]   Yes.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.240]   France and Germany both said, look, we have a pan European program.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.280]   We want to use that.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.360]   France was complaining because Apple said, well, no, you can't use this Bluetooth
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.760]   interface if you want to take data off the phone.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.480]   We won't let you.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.920]   Germany on Sunday said, okay.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.240]   Okay.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.880]   We're going to do it.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.680]   You have a will use the and you know what?
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.440]   I like and Steve Gibson has taken long looks at this.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   So I'm trusting Steve's reading the white papers.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.320]   Yeah, ever for.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.200]   And he says they've done the right thing.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   This is this is a system that's designed to protect privacy and yet still
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.720]   allow contact tracing.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.840]   Now, they made the adjustments.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   We last spoke about this.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.280]   Did Steve look into those adjustments and yes,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.000]   curious what the adjustment he talked again yesterday about it,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.440]   the adjustments and who of it.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.640]   One thing Google and Apple both said is all the information recorded by these
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.000]   phones will be dumped at the end of this time.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.120]   This is not going to be something we're going to hand over to the your government.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.240]   That's the great fear, right?
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.800]   The government will use this or even, you know, private industry will use this API
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.120]   to collect information.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.680]   But it's but it's designed from the ground up to really kind of not have personally
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.120]   identified information in any of this.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.360]   It just it and it seems like it's going to be something we're going to need.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   So Australia's designed their own terrible.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.760]   Terrible.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:48.320]   Countries that design their own tend to be much worse from a privacy perspective than
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.280]   this Apple Google thing.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   I suspect this is going to end up winning, especially since it will be on all modern
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.440]   Android and iOS devices.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.040]   Hey, that's the key.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.560]   South Korea has an app, but I think it's South Korea, but only like 12% of people
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.520]   download it. And so then you don't get enough data to that Singapore.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.280]   Singapore.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.320]   That's a 12% adoption of their contact tracing app.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.280]   12% in an authoritarian nation.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.560]   Maybe that's why.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.680]   I mean, that could be.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.880]   Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.640]   You pushed a little hard people say a little there.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:26.880]   Nope.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.480]   Because I suspect in the US, we've been pretty cooperative.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   I think this we've I'm kind of feel like we've all got a good job.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   We're in agreement.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.760]   If we're not with the White House, we're in agreement.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.160]   The interesting thing was I've seen I saw this this week.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.120]   I put up there was a paper from the UK where you see the far right and the far left
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.800]   especially in Europe are are both open up again.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.840]   It's kind of fascinating.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.080]   What's that seem like we're moving in that direction?
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.000]   Part of the reason for that is people like Elon Musk.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.200]   What was his tweet?
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.080]   Freedom now.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:14.480]   Part of the part of the reason for that is I think after free America now,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.200]   that was his tweet.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Free America now.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.320]   He's just after a while.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.440]   He wanted to get his workers back in the factory too, right?
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.480]   You know, I mean, look, he's living in a mansion with a lot of that.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   He has no there's something there's some timing thing with his
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.320]   stock.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.600]   I saw a story about that.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.560]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.680]   He's got people back to work.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   Well, I should have put it in the
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   Musk's tweet fest.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.160]   This is according to the esteemed Toronto star.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.200]   Is that esteemed?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.640]   I'm kind of a I was a globe and male guy.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.000]   The star is not.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.640]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.040]   You don't know.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.560]   I think it's deemed might be over.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.880]   Musk's tweet fest came a day after his plan to reopen Tesla's lone US vehicle
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   assembly plant looked doubtful with San Francisco Bay Area health authorities looking
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   to extend shelter in place.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.200]   It has in fact been extended here to June 1st.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.440]   Tesla has been eager to reopening after having clashed with the county and the city
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.160]   over whether it was an essential business and could remain open.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.240]   This doesn't mention anything about his stock holdings.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.720]   So this is some blue words.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   I put up on Forbes thing under other.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.400]   February raised exponential.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.640]   The Elon Musk would soon hit the first tranche of a jaw dropping pay package worth
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   almost $55 billion over a decade for any performance targets set by Tesla's board.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.160]   He could qualify for a payout of $435 million as early as late April,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.680]   although the timing is increasingly clouded by Tesla's share plunge amid coronavirus concerns.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.240]   So it's a $435 million tweet.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.400]   Maybe.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.440]   Maybe.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.240]   Don't want to be a conspiracy theorist or anything.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.440]   But he's done all right.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.400]   I think he's just kind of.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:15.280]   We have a lot of evidence that Elon is off his rocker or not.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.040]   Off his rockers quite right.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.920]   But my point was I think there is increasing pressure.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.560]   People are just getting more and more like, I can't take it.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.720]   I can't take it anymore.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.560]   And so all governments, including California, which was very aggressive,
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.480]   are starting to say, well,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.240]   but there are layers to this too though.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   I mean, I'm thinking about places where they're saying you have to go back to work.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.400]   And if you don't, you won't be eligible for anything, including
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.880]   that's their health care or you have.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.080]   So that's a problem in this country. Unlike yours, Matthew, most people in the US,
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.360]   more than half get their health insurance from their job.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:00.640]   And out of work means you have to, you know, you can, in most cases, you get cobra,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.120]   which means you basically have to cost a fortune.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.160]   Or to pay for it.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.200]   I mean, you won't lose your coverage, but you have to pay for it.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.000]   Your state says go back to the work.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   Right.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.200]   And you have to go even at risk to your health.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.680]   Right.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.480]   Because if you don't, you're, you get nothing.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:16.720]   Right.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.600]   Can you just take us over, please?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.000]   Canada?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.880]   I have to say, yeah, I'm pretty impressed with Trudeau.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.560]   He seems to be doing a nice job.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.520]   Is it good looking kid?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.720]   Nice beer.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.760]   No, I think he's done it.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.360]   I think he's done a pretty good job.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.720]   Facebook is posting a virtual graduation.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.200]   Oprah will be your commencement speaker this year.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.520]   I was just telling my daughter about that.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.440]   She was supposed to graduate.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.000]   Does that satisfy your daughter's need to walk?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.560]   I think she likes the fact that little NaaS X is going to be in it.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.280]   Like Ben.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.160]   There's a Jennifer Garner Simone Biles and Aquafina.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.200]   Joining Oprah Winfrey.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.720]   I was trying to find a Snapchat filter that would make it look like you had a
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   get on it and a cap on.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.520]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're working on it right now.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.200]   So that'll be May 15th.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.840]   I will watch this 11 a.m. Eastern.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.360]   It's #graduation2020.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.760]   Facebook and Instagram celebrate the class of 2020.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.280]   And little NaaS X will play Old Town Road because he only has them.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.520]   I have, I just imagine that college students are not going to be watching this.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.280]   So maybe this is another one of those privileged things,
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.600]   but I never really wanted to go to my high school graduation.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.120]   Right.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.600]   Did you?
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.040]   I went to my high school in a horrible red.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.080]   College I did not go to.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.000]   My mother never forgave me for it.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   College is different.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.080]   I went to college because that's a lot of work and
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.760]   the family really loves it and stuff.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.040]   I didn't graduate, so I didn't get it.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.680]   I didn't go.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.800]   Yeah, I didn't go.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.400]   I think it was the early 70s.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.560]   Actually it was a time of being obnoxious.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   My parents were out of the country, so I just took a pass.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.240]   So but there are certainly people for whom the high school graduation is a
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.120]   momentous occasion for them and their families.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.520]   Right.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.040]   College even more so.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.120]   You know, I went to my daughter's college graduation last summer and it was great.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.240]   And there were.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   Did you hear about the kids who made virtual versions of their universities in Minecraft?
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:46.320]   So they were right down to the square footage and the layout so that they could have virtual
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.200]   graduation.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   I think that's so cool.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.800]   Japanese students did it.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.240]   Cal students are doing it right now.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.640]   I think this is such a great idea.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.120]   And the thing is this generation grew up with Minecraft.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.680]   Open.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.240]   Stop, stop, stop.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.880]   Oh.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.400]   As much as I love Donald Sutherland, I don't really want to watch him do an ad for American
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.360]   Express right now.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.040]   Well, I guess I don't have a choice.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.880]   Group of Cal students is constructing the entire University of California campus in Minecraft.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.160]   See this I want to see.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.120]   I can jump ahead.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   Lockley University.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.840]   Yeah, and there's high schools in New York and other places.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.320]   Oh, it's not even that.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.440]   It's a Go Daddy ad.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.000]   Here we go.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.280]   Minecraft graduation.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.160]   Look at that.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.720]   It's pretty.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.200]   They've got that's nice.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.880]   Oh, they even built the cow ball.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.360]   There's this.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.760]   There's.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.880]   Yeah, there's.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   Blockley.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.360]   You receive block California.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.840]   Blockley.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.160]   Because these guys, that's what they do.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.000]   Man, I'm watching this generation.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.840]   They're so good at Minecraft builds.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.600]   And why not do why not create it?
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.960]   Look at that looks just like.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.320]   Well, and musicians are doing like performances in Fortnite.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.600]   Like this is basically second life.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.080]   Actually, this leads us to Siva Vaajanathan's tweets, which scared the hell out of me.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.640]   He's a professor.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.600]   He's at where's he?
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.240]   Georgetown?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.640]   Where's he?
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.920]   Yeah, University of Virginia.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.480]   Virginia.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:20.880]   That's right.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.360]   UVA.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.560]   Thomas Jefferson's University.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   He sounds like he's very worried that if there is no college in the fall,
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.800]   which is still a possibility,
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.960]   the many universities will just go out of business.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.200]   There's mostly colleges.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.760]   Colleges.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.120]   Is it state schools?
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:41.760]   Yes or no?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.120]   It's schools.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.560]   Well, we're terribly worried about our budget because, you know,
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.080]   our budget comes from Cuomo and around now we all have to love him and we do.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.400]   But he's got other priorities.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.760]   But he tends to be very tough on our budget.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.480]   And yeah.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.600]   Some universities are proposing in the face of this.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   Here's Purdue's president Daniels saying, what if we have the students come and lock the doors?
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.640]   Basically, yeah, it's very controversial letter, but he's arguing that,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.520]   well, the young people don't really have any risk and we can,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.960]   we're in a small town and so we can, you know, all but build a wall around it.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.200]   And we got to get back.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.560]   But they're not going to stay there.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.840]   They're not going to stay there.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   Of course not.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.760]   Of course not.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.720]   Well, and it's also some question where the young people are so immune.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.240]   He's, you know, the stories.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.200]   There were two things.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.680]   One is the stories about blood clotting and strokes and absolutely terrifying
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   and one younger people.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.120]   Two is it has an impact.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.240]   We don't even, we don't know the full impact yet on other or.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.520]   And the CDC, CDC said that it's there.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.960]   One of their theories was that young people are carriers.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.200]   But don't, may not contract it, but they may be asymptomatic carriers.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   The truth is we all go home to their parents.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.480]   We just don't know.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.240]   There's so much we don't know about this virus.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.360]   Young people do get it.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.080]   We just don't, you know, they do get it, of course, but the, but, and maybe they don't get it as bad,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   but still it's Kim, we don't know.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:16.720]   This is, this is a novel virus and it takes years to really understand the mechanism of these things.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.320]   And so I think we assume, oh, look, we're, we're amazing.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.760]   What science can do, it's incredible.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.520]   We should know everything by now about this virus.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.480]   We know they're just mysteries.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:24.960]   We don't know.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.480]   So.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.320]   In fact, there's been a couple of really good articles.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.600]   I think the Atlantic had one.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.880]   Just going through all the stuff we don't know.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.840]   We don't know how it kills people.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.240]   Really?
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.840]   It kills, seems to kill people in multiple ways, affecting multiple organs,
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.480]   clotting, sometimes lung.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.560]   Like we literally, there, there's more we don't know than there is that we know.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.760]   So, which is the form of journalism.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.360]   We should have all the time, Matthew.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.160]   What we don't know.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.760]   So, start with what we don't know.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.840]   Yeah, we talked about that at CDR actually.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.160]   Really?
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.360]   How, how bad journalists are at saying, I don't know.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.320]   Humans are bad at that.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.960]   Humans are terrible at that.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.000]   Yeah, humans are terrible at that.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.200]   In particular about it, but at a time like this, it's even more important for the media to say,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.800]   we don't know.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.680]   We literally do not know the answer to this question.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.160]   It's really important and we can tell you what people are saying about it,
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.840]   but we cannot give you.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.080]   And I think for a long time, the media tried to seem infallible and omniscient.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.160]   And I think that's backfiring.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.880]   Well, the other thing, Matthew, is that we're terrible at working on.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.360]   Let's do some self-hating journalist moments.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.600]   Is we don't understand science's process.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.880]   As my father said, we take the latest word as the last word.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.360]   And scientists, now that I'm reading them a hell of a lot,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.280]   because you'll see there on my lower third bit.ly/COVID Twitter list.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.960]   I'm reading 575 of them every day.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.040]   One of the great skills of a scientist and an academic is what more research do we need?
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.320]   What don't we know?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.600]   And we don't say that in journalists.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.400]   That's below our ego threshold.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.880]   I remember Dan Gilmore, I think it was, or saying that, you know, every good
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.880]   story about something complex should have a giant box that says, "Here's what we don't know."
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.160]   But so few places do that.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.760]   It's sad.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.640]   It makes sense in breaking news.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.680]   We should be doing that, right?
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.080]   No, we don't really vote over the shooter.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.640]   No, we don't know.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.120]   We're dead.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.160]   But, and in science news.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.360]   There was a case, I wrote about this last week.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.480]   I think I talked about it briefly, but there was a New York Times story that
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:51.280]   just quoted the author of a controversial paper, the Santa Clara paper, and did,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.240]   quoted no one else.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.360]   And we need some very simple basic standards.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.960]   When you have a preprint paper, you need to go to people other than the author.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.680]   We don't do that.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.720]   Yeah, I think the preprint thing has really, you know, people see it and they're like,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   "Oh, yeah, it's a scientific paper."
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.000]   And the guy who wrote it is like a scientist and has lettered after his name.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.120]   And so we should just write whatever it says in there.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.480]   Right, but the preprints, you know, I've written about this,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.560]   the scientists I've talked to about this are really grateful for the preprints.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.680]   It's changed their world immensely, but they know how to vet it.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.400]   They know how to deal with it, but they also do it.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.600]   So in the case of that New York Times story, if the Times had merely searched
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.480]   Twitter, they would have found five epidemiologists who attacked that paper.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.520]   And they didn't include it.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.560]   They didn't go to the effort.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.280]   The scientists are out there doing peer review at the speed of the internet now using Twitter.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.920]   It's amazing.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.720]   It's phenomenal.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:55.680]   Yeah, that is part of, I think, what we're struggling with is that science is happening
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.840]   in real time now in a way that it didn't use.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   So this is the president of Brown University, Christina Paxson in the New York Times today.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.680]   College campuses must reopen in the fall.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.720]   And she's also proposing the same thing.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   Brown has a fence all the way around it.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.000]   I guess you could lock the fence.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.400]   My mom is nearby in Cranston.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:28.240]   I would hate for her to have health problems because we got 5,000 kids in dorms.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:28.960]   Exactly.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.880]   Egg, zack from all over the county.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.920]   Well, Steve has tweeted too.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.720]   He said nobody goes to Brown.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.240]   You know, it's tiny.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.480]   Most students, they're in junior colleges, they're in state universities,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.800]   they're not living in dorms, they're not going to dining halls,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   they're not in a closed and controlled environment.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.320]   So what's wrong with Zoom?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.400]   What's wrong with online education?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.200]   I thought this might be the beginning of a new wave in education.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.000]   It works.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.280]   I think it works really well.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.400]   You're doing it, right?
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.840]   I'm taught in Zoom.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.160]   You know, I'm teaching older students.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.680]   I also taught, I did a class at an undergrad class, my 40 students,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.280]   and funny, undergrad is just different.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.600]   They're twitchy, twitchy because I was boring.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   But I'm teaching graduate students and it works pretty damn well.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.800]   And the problem is that there are certain things you want to do in person,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.080]   but there's a lot you could do.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.440]   It really should change.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.720]   I've been thinking for a long time that we should be changing how we use classroom time.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   We shouldn't be teaching skills in classroom.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   We should be teaching them outside the classroom and doing other things while we're in.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.760]   It's an opportunity to learn new ways, but my feel, even in a place where I am,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.120]   where we change a lot, universities don't change.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.840]   I've had long conversations with my father, as we were talking about before.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.720]   The show was a longtime college professor now retired.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   And this is well before COVID.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.320]   This is 10 years ago.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.960]   He talked a little bit about how the original idea of universities,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:13.440]   going back to Cambridge and Oxford, was scholars gathering for a gloquea.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.640]   It wasn't about students sitting in a lecture as a professor taught them.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.080]   It wasn't like a high school is with a teacher and students.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.440]   It was more collegial.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.640]   That's where that word comes from.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.080]   It was a colloquium of scholars on a topic, kind of more something,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.720]   more a little Talmudic, more like the kind of rabbinical studies,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.240]   talking about the Talmud.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:42.000]   And he thought that actually that's how the in-person part of a university should be.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.840]   And the rest, the lecture stuff, all of that stuff,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.800]   he thought even then could be online.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.920]   It doesn't need to be in person.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.720]   But there is an in-person component, but it's not the teaching part.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.440]   In fact, that's actually a philosophy in high schools.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.480]   In fact, education all over the world right now, they call it flipping,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.080]   where instead of going to school to get the lecture and then going home
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.360]   and struggling alone with your homework, you flip it.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.520]   The lectures are at home at night.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.760]   And where you go to school is to work to collaborate with your peers
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.400]   under the auspices of a teacher to understand the material, to do the homework,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.760]   do the homework at school and do the lectures at home.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.560]   I was up for a
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.880]   Deanship somewhere some time ago, didn't take it.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.680]   I decided to stay where I am or wasn't offered it either.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.720]   I backed out.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.120]   Because as I was brainstormed with myself how to think about this,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.680]   it's a little trite, what I'm about to say, but not for the first time.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.960]   But what you need is a genius bar.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.200]   You need the ability for students who are trying to learn,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.360]   who get in trouble, can go to somewhere, go to people and say,
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.880]   help me with this. And they're self-directed and they know what the goal is.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.440]   They want to get to that goal and outcome and they learn how best they can get there.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.200]   And then you help them, you provide services for them to do that.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.480]   But that doesn't mean spending 45 hours in a classroom
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.960]   all together, all at the same time at different speeds or in the same thing.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.440]   So instead of saying, as these two university presidents are,
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.320]   well, let's just figure out a way to keep doing what we've been doing all along.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.560]   Maybe there's financial constraints. It's certainly universities lose money.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.520]   It's certainly very expensive. Even these elite private schools lose money.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.840]   But maybe we can rethink what education is at this point.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.560]   My son has been online in high school.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.280]   The whole high school experience. He's a senior.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.160]   He'll graduate in December because he's so much of, he's accelerated because of his online experience.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.480]   And he loves it. He's very happy with it.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.560]   In fact, you're talking about going to the regular school for his senior year.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.640]   So he could be with his friends and socialize and stuff because that's all senior years anyway.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.000]   And he said, yeah, but then, but they're going to want me to do debate.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.520]   And I don't want to do any public speaking. He's happier, frankly, in the online school.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.560]   He's really found a way and I listen and he's talking. There's other students talking.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.880]   There's communication. This is a generation that's grown up.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.840]   Oh, God. Yeah.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.360]   Well, he plays video games. His friends go home to play video games with him.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   They're all online. They can't play next to each other. They have to go home to their computer.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.640]   And then they're all on Discord and they're talking and that's his social life.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.720]   And that's what he grew up with. I don't want to judge it. It's not what my social life looked like.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.200]   But it seems to work for him. So I don't know.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:45.600]   So what choices if he goes to college? He's going to have to go to the regular JC.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.400]   I don't think there's any online. That's one of that one. Maybe now. Maybe now.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.160]   There are going to be more options that aren't because that was one of the great Instagram accounts.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.520]   You're all just going online school now. Don't make fun of
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.960]   what's it called? Not Pacific. What Pacific?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.480]   University of Pacific. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.240]   University of Pacific, right? Brown. You're online. Harvard.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.720]   You're like everybody else. You're online.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.240]   Right. It's a great equalizer. Honestly, do you even need to go to a university? Now a days,
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.000]   you can we got to find a way to make it financially worthwhile. But you can take courses from Stanford,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.480]   MIT, Harvard. Harvard's incredible computer science course. CS50 is free online. And it's awesome.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:39.440]   It's really great. In fact, I'm trying to encourage these high schoolers to take a freshman year
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.960]   course from Harvard because it's the best computer science course out there.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   And any kid anywhere without the means, we do have to figure out how to make it work.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.160]   Harvard honestly loses money on every student. They survive through the endowment of the alumni.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   So maybe there's some way of making that work. I don't know. It's a different rock model. Harvard's
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.720]   very, very expensive. But most students, by the way, and I apologize. I swore at Harvard two weeks
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:15.680]   ago because I didn't, I followed the news instead of reading the real story. Harvard got
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:22.080]   eight million dollars. And I thought it was in this from a stimulus relief package. It was actually
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.200]   a package intended for higher education to go to students because most of Harvard students
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.080]   are on scholarship because it's so damn expensive. And it was to support those students.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.400]   And it was completely reasonable for Harvard to do that.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.840]   Students, it's a lot of money that so in the case of CUNY, because CUNY is a city university,
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.080]   and we unlike Columbia, where Matthew is, we serve the people.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:51.280]   And so the money that came was tied to students with Pell Grants, which done
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:58.720]   with us as a graduate school. No good. But CCNY, your own Pell Grants to be there, then
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.600]   yeah, it was the same intent. I think so. The money Harvard took completely appropriate,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.040]   I apologize, Harvard. I still hate you, but only at football. For different reasons.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   Only in football. No, I don't hate Harvard. Our best producer is a Harvard man, as I constantly say.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:25.840]   So, so I think, can we talk about Google requiring all advertisers to identify themselves?
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.160]   Yeah, I think that's good, don't you? Big deal. I think it's a wonderful thing.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   We were getting to the point of the Honest Ads Act, just trying to get them doing political
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.880]   advertising. Facebook was doing that for political advertising. Now to set the standard up to say
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.320]   all advertisers ought to be transparent. I think it's wonderful. It's right down slide here.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:57.120]   No, I'll give you the technological reason to celebrate this. One of the biggest security
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:04.080]   problems right now is these automated ad systems. Google, Facebook, everybody. You don't have to
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:11.680]   show up. You just can buy an ad, provide the ad collateral, which can contain malware.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.560]   And it's happened. Many very prestigious sites have served up malware because these ads are
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.880]   automate, completely automated. They're purchased automatically. Nobody reviews them. They go up
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:27.440]   on the page and boom, you got malware. So, I think it's very valuable and very important.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.000]   I don't know why they haven't done this before. You should be. You should be able to, you're buying
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.320]   an ad. We should know who bought the ad. It's an expense because they're going to have to go.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.760]   This is going to take years. They said to get all around the world. It's going to start in the US.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:46.400]   It occurs to me that there's a value in verification space.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.320]   So, now the advantage of an advertiser is if I advertise on Google, you can find me. You know
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   who I am. Those ads are better ads. When I did my over Twitter list, I think I mentioned this
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:07.280]   before. Twitter came to me and said, can you help get some of these scientists verified?
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.640]   And so, I contacted a lot of them who I thought was very good and did some other
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.800]   upset. I wasn't going to do the blue check mark. Just the blue check, yeah, or the blue stethoscope.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.640]   And so, there's a verification, right? And scientists were incredibly grateful
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:29.040]   for being verified on Twitter. It meant something because they are used to credentials.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:36.000]   And I think it's fascinating to imagine kind of a, we used to talk about namespace on the internet.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.200]   What about a verification space? Well, there are lots of reasons for that. There's also some
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.960]   fear about that because there is some need for anonymity.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.600]   For some people, whistle blowers, abuse, speculation.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.160]   No, no, no, it shouldn't be not everybody should be verified.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.680]   Right. I think it's not a requirement. I think advertisers should.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:02.960]   But for certain tasks, yeah. Here's the from the Google ad blog. This is what it would look like.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.320]   You would hover over the advertisers URL and there'd be an about this advertiser.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.200]   And it would show their name, their location. And by the way, there's a little switch that says,
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.480]   I don't want to see any more ads from this advertiser, which is interesting.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:23.520]   So I think this is absolutely a great thing. I think it will make it a safer space.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:31.840]   You know, you can't buy an ad on Twitter. We do more than verify. I mean, we get to know you.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.960]   Anybody is advertising. And none of our ads can possibly hurt you because they're just audio.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.600]   But lots of websites are running ads with flash in them and all sorts of stuff in them.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   That's potentially very dangerous. So I think this is a great idea. I hope Google
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.560]   makes not only makes this a standard for all of the Google ads, but sets the standard that other
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   companies have to adhere to. I wonder if this is going to lead to any, you know, a drop in,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:02.960]   just add buys. Why? Why? No, Google's. Well, because people might not want to do it, I guess.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.920]   If it's, yeah, but I think Matthew has got a group. Yeah, but they're probably bad ads.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   They're probably ads that also cost them effort. Yeah, so right. So yeah,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.760]   I'm just thinking I was looking at the item about Google worried that it's, you know,
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.560]   ad business is going to slow down as a result of COVID. Right. So the two of those things together
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.200]   might. It's a tough thing to do. Actually, Google's results were good this quarter,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.360]   but they did. What did they say? 30% are not going to be good next. Add sales loss. Yeah.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.240]   Microsoft's results are coming out right now. A number of companies.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.080]   I have a friend of a friend who works in the ad industry works for a large
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:50.560]   ad network that I won't name. And he said there they've been seeing 30 to 40% drops across
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.400]   and forward worldwide. Oh, I don't know. But I think it's, I think the market might have
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:02.720]   worked this in Google stock to close today up 8.74% under $7.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:09.920]   Yeah. Yeah, the stock market loves it. Although the stock market's looking for any
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:14.480]   ray of sunlight at this point. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:21.360]   And the stock I was very sure it. That's right. I wouldn't look for quite some time.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.160]   I got rid of almost all my stock because I just I'm too old to be sitting on this
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:35.440]   ride for much longer. So I locked in those losses. Yes, sir.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:46.560]   Lock them in. EFF talking about, by the way, the Apple Google API is now out in beta. And I'm,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.200]   I think in the next couple of days, you're going to get an Apple update on your iOS devices and
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.880]   an Android update on your Android device. I don't go into it no matter what, right? You can,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.560]   you don't have to use it, but it'll be there. It's well, it doesn't do anything until you
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.840]   somebody writes an app to use it. And that you do not have to download. I got a question.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:12.160]   Go ahead. If you have a Huawei phone. Just what if asking your friend,
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.680]   Han Matthew? Oh, that's interesting. Because you don't have the Google stuff on that.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:22.000]   And as I remember, I'm trying to do it. I do. It's an older one. Because I'm sort of grandpa.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.320]   All right. If you have Google services on there, you'll get it. I think I remember that that's
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.600]   how Google's pushing out this update is through the Google services, basically the Google
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:38.160]   app, the Google store API. If you are on a Huawei phone that's de-googled, I don't think you will
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   get it. Yeah, I wonder you wouldn't. You wouldn't. You get a special Chinese version.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:49.120]   So then the Chinese government can thank you. Yeah. So I would read, if you're concerned about
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:58.560]   the privacy, I would read the EFF's complaints. I don't think their complaints are specific.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:04.480]   Nobody really knows how effective these apps are. They're cautious. Most people,
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   is it appropriate to consider a cell phone to equal one cell phone, one person?
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.840]   Is that appropriate? And so things like that. But I don't think they've found any
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.800]   really big problems here. And I think Google and Apple have been very
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:30.320]   open to any criticisms that have responded. I mean, in a way, I think it was pinboard.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.560]   I don't want to try and pronounce his actual name. A change on her lousky.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:44.640]   Yeah, that's it. That's exactly how I would have said it. He said, you know, all this,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.000]   they're doing all this already. You've already agreed to all the things that they are
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.840]   targeting, effectively going to be doing. They're just using it to sell you.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.440]   In fact, this is more private than ad beacons, which has been in your phone for years.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.880]   And I think this is a sensible plan. And it's, you know, this is the right way to go forward.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.120]   We need to. And it does not. We've had this already before, but just be clear. Everybody
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.760]   in my feed is saying it will not replace the contract crassers. We need the contract crassers.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.560]   Humans. That work is necessary. Human contract. But it's going to be helpful.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.200]   And if it reduces the ping pong balls that are bouncing off of each other to a certain rate,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.640]   it helps. Yeah, you want to get the contagion rate, the R0 down below one,
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.760]   which it is in many areas. It probably is here just because we've all been sheltering in place.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   But the minute everybody goes out, it goes, whoop, right back. Can you explain something to me, Leo?
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:43.040]   Yeah. R0. What does that stand for, actually? Do you have any idea?
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:49.520]   I'm suspecting reproductive rate. But what as you know, what it means is the number of people
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.080]   who will be affected by any given person. So if it's less than one, it means that the virus
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.760]   isn't spreading. If it's more than one, it means it's spreading. And the larger the number,
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:03.600]   the faster the spread. And I think the last time I saw, I don't know, it's 2.5 for COVID-19. So
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:10.480]   every one person will on average affect two and a half other people. That's a geometric progression.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.320]   That's a very high rate if it's not controlled somehow. And I mean,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.240]   the problem is, people know what that means. It's like 12.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.040]   Meezles is very contagious. So we don't really know what the actual R0 is.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.760]   No, no, you can't find it. We don't know anything. We don't know anything.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.880]   And you know, Lisa said, "Oh, good news." You just saw it on the TV news.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.200]   Remus of the deer.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:39.360]   No, quest diagnostics is opening a lab down the street. We can go get antibody tests.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:47.040]   120 bucks. So she said, "Good, you get it. We don't need to both get it. If you have the
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   antibodies, then I probably do. And if you don't, then I probably don't." So go ahead and get it.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.520]   And there's not a, I think there's a one approved test.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.240]   No, and it's kind of meaningless. So it's a blood draw, which is one of the better tests.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.640]   You know, there's a lot of tests which are dropping.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.880]   But it's not clear what the antibodies even are.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.600]   What does it even mean?
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.320]   It doesn't.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.360]   Are you contagious?
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.000]   You may not even be impeding.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.040]   What if she said, what if it says, "Yeah, hey, good news. You had it."
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.600]   Does she then say, "Good, I can go walk around? No."
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.240]   Because we don't know.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.800]   Well, the next day, that's the thing. So you start, you know, you're going to test
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.560]   teachers in school, or you're going to test, oh, I don't know, vice presidents.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.960]   Oh my God.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.040]   Two days after you get the test is no reason you can't have become infected and cannot become...
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.920]   That's true.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.480]   A spreader.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.360]   That's true.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:43.040]   But no, that's why the antibody tests are useful. Because in theory, if it's like the flu, for
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.600]   instance, where having the flu gives you some immunity for about a year, then once you have
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.160]   the antibodies, you can say, "Okay, I'm good."
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.360]   But maybe...
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.280]   The WHO is making sure that I know the evidence yet to know.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.880]   I don't want any golden tickets handed out.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.040]   And the updated R0 is 5.7.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:03.520]   5?
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.560]   Wow.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.040]   Yeah, 5.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:05.840]   See, that's bad.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.600]   That's again, that's the...
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   Is it the numerator or the denominator that's...
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.720]   Oh, it's going to be confused. But we don't have enough tests overall.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:21.120]   Iceland is the only nearly universal enough test, and that's a small population in the
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.600]   console.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.920]   So just like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, apparently, according to Business Insider,
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.120]   is back in the saddle.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.640]   After years of solely focusing on high-impact products like Alexa,
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.600]   Amazon told... Actually, this is a New York Times article.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.200]   The Bezos told the New York Times Bezos has turned back,
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.080]   quote, "turned back to the here and now problems facing Amazon."
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:53.600]   And I just want to say, I have turned back to the here and now problems facing Twitch.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.880]   I am taking the wheel back at Twitch.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.520]   I just went out there and sold some damn dads, will you?
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.200]   Now that's a haircut I could live with.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   Jeff Bezos, who's got excellent eyebrows, though.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.640]   Excellent eyebrows.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.400]   You think they're died?
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.680]   He has a whole team of people for the idea.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.160]   I don't know. I don't know anything about Jeff Bezos.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:18.800]   No one does.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:28.080]   So he's over his divorce, he's settling down, he's going to pay attention.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.400]   That good or bad for Amazon.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.720]   If I were an Amazon stock holder, I'd say yes, right?
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.480]   We want Mr. B in charge.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.640]   They've just got to treat the employees better.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.840]   It's going to backfire.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.920]   Yeah, the optics are very bad when you're the richest man in the world.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.640]   And you're not even that when your company is growing like crazy and is vital.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.200]   Every company says, "Oh, our most valuable asset is our employees."
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.680]   We'll mean it.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.520]   Benedict Evans says, "Oh, calm down."
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.560]   Well, that's the relation to the story about.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.520]   That's his MO actually.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.080]   That's Carsten and me having a dialogue in the...
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:19.760]   I have to go back then to the Amazon scooped up data from its own sellers, Wall Street Journal,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.360]   to launch competing products.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.320]   How dare they?
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:22.720]   No!
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.160]   How dare they?
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:29.760]   So Benedict points out this happens in retail and has been happening.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.160]   Sure.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.880]   It represents.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.400]   Amazon didn't invent it.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.840]   Benedict Evans stores see what sells and then they make their own brand of it.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.800]   It's always been there.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.560]   Clearly Benedict's...
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.080]   The fact Jeff Jarvis fan, because his headline is "moral panic."
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   And then the quote up here was a big...
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.480]   Well done.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.160]   You just discovered retail.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:55.040]   There's a big retailer, grocery store company that sells what they call no frills,
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.160]   which are no name products.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.360]   We have generics here.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   Take whatever people like and then they just make a no name version.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.800]   Often it's the same product.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.440]   We have that too.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.080]   Yeah, Pete Buttigieg did some consulting for them.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:12.560]   Oh really?
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.240]   He was kind of the no name presidential candidate.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:20.720]   He was kind of generic.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.920]   No frills anyway.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.760]   No frills presidential candidate.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.800]   Let's see.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.440]   Let's take a break and we have a change log to do.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   I will allow you gentlemen to pick some stories.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.520]   I don't want to be the only arbiter of the news here.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.080]   I think I'll see what was put in here to irritate me.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   They're not paranoid.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.840]   It's all about...
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.880]   Of course Jeff Jarvis.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.160]   ...Kackling, evilly, on his deck eating his Taco Bell.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.240]   Yeah, I could see Carson.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.680]   I see Carson doing exactly that.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.520]   You know, he is a Harvard man.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.680]   Our show today brought to you by E-Roe.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.800]   Love my E-Roe.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.760]   Love my E-Roe.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.840]   We're all at home now and your home internet suddenly is looming large, isn't it, in your success?
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.280]   Wi-Fi used to be great when we only had a few devices,
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   but now that we've got dozens of IoT devices,
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.080]   we've got neighbors with super powerful routers.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:27.680]   Suddenly Wi-Fi has been less reliable.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.400]   Well now you can set up the most reliable Wi-Fi you've ever had,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.040]   the E-Roe mesh system.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.880]   You can start at $79.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.680]   That's a really great starting price and then build it as you need it.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.600]   E-Roe is a mesh system.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.440]   That means it blankets your whole home with fast reliable Wi-Fi,
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.480]   eliminating poor coverage, no dead spots, no buffering.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.080]   You have a signal everywhere.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:54.080]   The best way to think of it is Wi-Fi is like the light from a lamp.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.720]   You can't turn on a lamp next to your router and expect the light to shed
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.680]   all the way through your house.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.960]   What you need is your E-Roe base station and E-Roe beacons
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.520]   to spread the light through your home.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.120]   E-Roe sets up in minutes, plugs right into your modem or your modem router.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.880]   It has a great app.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.080]   You can manage your E-Roe.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.360]   I actually manage, I have an E-Roe at home and mom has an E-Roe.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.960]   I manage her network from here.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.960]   If there's ever a problem, I can look right and see what's going on.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.800]   The app does all sorts of wonderful things.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.600]   It lets you pause the Wi-Fi for dinner, gives you alerts if any device joins your network.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   I always know when people come into my house because I see them joining the network.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.040]   It just makes a huge improvement.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.160]   I hate that noise that I hear, I used to hear.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.360]   Here's the E-Roe app.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.920]   From time to time when my wife would say, "The Wi-Fi is down again."
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.880]   That's exactly what she's handling.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.040]   The Wi-Fi is down again, I'm poor.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.400]   Not anymore, not with E-Roe.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.680]   In fact, Lisa's working in her office.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.960]   Michael's doing his home schooling online with E-Roe.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.240]   I've got servers running in my office all on E-Roe.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.680]   Here's my download speeds.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:12.000]   But I can also, so there's a look at all the activity, including security scans.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.960]   This week alone, 225,063 security scans.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.920]   We don't want malware when you're at home.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.800]   Threat blocks, 188 threats have been blocked.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   Monday was a bad day for threats.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.080]   Oh, we were all home, that's why.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.800]   I'm not home on Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.480]   Look how much better that looks.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.200]   It must be me.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.040]   I must be doing it.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.960]   This is E-Roe Plus, which I really love.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.080]   Add blocking, yes.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.960]   3,861 adds.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.360]   And content filters, both of them through our sun.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.200]   I can look and see what he was trying to see.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.200]   If I...
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.920]   So he's got devices that are assigned to him,
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.040]   which I can pause.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.800]   In fact, I do pause at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.160]   No more gaming.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.360]   E-Roe just gives you total control.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   And as I mentioned, I can see other networks.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.760]   So I can switch from my network at home to my mom's network.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.720]   She's in Rhode Island.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.360]   And I can see what's going on with mom's network.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.800]   I can see what this always used to make me happy.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.560]   I would check her internet speed.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.080]   And it was really slow.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.880]   She's on...
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.560]   She's on fiber now.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.680]   616 megabits down, 421 megabits up.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.400]   I can see how many security scans,
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.520]   how many threats blocked,
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.880]   how many ads are blocked.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.920]   I love E-Roe.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.520]   E-Roe is Wi-Fi you deserve.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.920]   It fixes all your Wi-Fi issues.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.040]   And you can get it fixed as soon as tomorrow for as little as $79.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.440]   Get started with E-Roe right now.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.600]   Go to E-Roe.com/twit.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.640]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.120]   You'll get free overnight shipping at checkout.

[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.240]   Stop suffering with bad Wi-Fi.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.800]   Now that we're all home, we're banging on the Wi-Fi.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.880]   We watch a ton of streaming.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.120]   We were watching Ozark on Netflix last night.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.680]   Michael was playing games in his room.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.480]   It's just... it's flawless.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.280]   E-E-R-O.com/twit.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.080]   Offer code TWIT.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:12.880]   Thank you, Iro.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.760]   For making Wi-Fi live up to its promise.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.400]   All right, do your stories and then we'll do the Google change log.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.720]   I want to give Jeff time to get his finger on the drums.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   Jeff, what was the story?
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.600]   You, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.240]   What was this?
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:26.880]   There's two Jeffs.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.840]   Now it's confusing.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.720]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.720]   Somebody put one in there.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.760]   Professor Jarvis.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.640]   Yes.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.960]   Suggesting from the Yale Law Journal,
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.640]   one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.080]   Oh, I put this in here.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.880]   Oh, you see?
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   I thought this was very provocative.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.720]   Oh.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.120]   The obsolescence of advertising in the information age.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.080]   According to...
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.720]   Well, this guy, I'm sorry.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.000]   He's an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.400]   Okay.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.360]   Okay.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.320]   And then there are other people involved.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.640]   You can take the student out of Yale, but you can't take the Yale Institute.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.520]   This might be the Yale Law Review, but it is not.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.960]   So the idea...
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.080]   I love... actually, I love this.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.560]   I thought this was very provocative, and I would love to know what you guys think of this.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.160]   Here's the abstract.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.520]   The vast amount of product information available to consumers
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   through online search, right?
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.320]   We know everything.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:27.840]   Renders most advertising obsolete as a tool for conveying product information.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.720]   Advertising remains useful to firms only as a tool for persuading consumers to purchase products.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:43.360]   In fact, in the mid-20th century, courts applying the antitrust laws held such persuasive advertising
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.400]   is anti-competitive and harmful to consumers.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.560]   The FTC didn't do anything about it because back then, before the internet,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.320]   they didn't want to deprive consumers of the information value in advertising.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.280]   But he says now that advertising doesn't have to give us information anymore, thanks to the
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.960]   internet, the FTC should renew its campaign against persuasive advertising by treating all
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.040]   advertising beyond the minimum required to ensure the product information is available to
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.360]   online searchers as monopolization of violation of the Sherman Anti-Trast Act.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   That doesn't sound legal.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.320]   The legal argument is here is stretched like salt water taffy on a hot day.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.080]   Let's go through the points one by one.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.000]   First of all, isn't it the case?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.800]   In fact, this was the hope.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   I remember the Clute Train Manifesto.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.440]   Doc Searle is saying, you know, information is perfect now.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.000]   Markets are a conversation and thanks to the internet, if you want to know more about
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.080]   Eero, the ad we just did, you could find out everything.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.200]   I don't need to tell you anything about it.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.560]   You can find everything you need to know.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.160]   All you need to know is that it exists.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.200]   And you can find that out with a search.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.560]   Just search for mesh internet.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.280]   What is antitrust about that?
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.080]   So what the later argues in the paper is that cuts?
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:56.960]   Well, no, I know.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.400]   We'll get there.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.040]   We'll get there.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.320]   So I just want to know.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.760]   Do you stipulate that that's the case?
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.040]   That information is now relatively perfect.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.280]   The way I put it is advertising is failure.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.200]   If your product isn't evident, if your other customers haven't recommended it to you,
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.120]   if you don't know about it, then everything else you want first off and foremost,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.200]   because it's all free, fails.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.400]   And that's why you advertise.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:20.960]   So I apologize.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.240]   Is there anything wrong?
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.840]   And again, I'm not getting any interest yet.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.320]   We'll get there.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.120]   And I agree with you.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.240]   There's no that's no.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.600]   But anyway, is there anything wrong with persuasive advertising?
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.760]   You know, advertising for years, you know, you put the bottle of scope on your colleagues chair
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.240]   because you don't want to tell them he's got bad breath.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.120]   Advertising for years was all about four out of five doctors recommend a hearty breakfast
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.400]   or smoke, smoke, kens because there's not a cough and a pack.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.560]   Advertising for years is just about not information, but persuasion.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.480]   The hidden persuaders.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.800]   Do you think that that's problematic?
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.760]   Matthew?
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.000]   No.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   That's OK.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.560]   No.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.600]   I mean, and I don't understand how the fact that you run persuasive advertising
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.560]   can be an antitrust.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.640]   Well, I'm going to allow you.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   Well, I'm just going to try to stretch this out.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.400]   No, I'm not to stretch it out.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.920]   I think those are both good points.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.800]   I think persuasive advertising is manipulative.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.240]   I agree.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.720]   And I think I've always said we try to do our ads.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.600]   So is teaching.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.040]   So is religion.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:27.520]   No, no, no.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.640]   Don't lose.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.720]   No, no, manipulative in the sense that going back to Edgar Burnay,
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.040]   trying to use his uncle, uncle,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.200]   sigmunds of philosophies of the unconscious mind to persuade you
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.360]   that you need this product.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.120]   I think that's manipulative.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.760]   I think that information is important.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.360]   All of the ads we do, in every case, the ads we do,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.400]   we don't try to manipulate you.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:52.800]   We try it.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.480]   We just tell you, here's a product.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.040]   Here's how it works.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.480]   Here's why we think it's a good idea.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.240]   I think that's OK.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.760]   You could argue that you saying you like it
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.120]   and how much you like it is designed to be manipulative.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.000]   Persuasive it.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.800]   Because we trust you.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.360]   We love you.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.080]   OK, that's a point.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.160]   Now, that's somewhat manipulative.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:12.800]   OK.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.080]   So there's some level of persuasion, maybe that's OK.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.520]   I mean, honestly, that makes a good point.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.000]   All human behavior is manipulative.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.560]   I love manipulation.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.080]   In my mind, the best advertising they've always said is word of mouth.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.720]   In my mind, what we are doing is word of mouth advertising.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:30.960]   Yes.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.280]   Right.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.960]   It says if I'm your neighbor over the fence saying,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.560]   "Hey, this works great for me, you ought to try it."
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.400]   And we try to make that be honest.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.800]   So if it's persuasive, it's the same way I love it.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.160]   It's more expensive.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.840]   It's not a bad kind of persuasion.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:53.920]   But some ads are manipulative.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.080]   So maybe we shouldn't say persuasive, but manipulative.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.960]   Now, I don't know if the manipulative,
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.400]   that's if the manipulation gets to the point where it's
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:08.240]   untruthful, then clearly that's something that laws have some theory of.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.240]   It is a lie, not the manipulation.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:10.480]   Right.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.280]   Courts applying-- this is the line that we should probably debate.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.680]   Courts applying antitrust laws held that such persuasive advertising
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.920]   is any competitive and harmful to consumers.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.480]   I'd love to see those cases and see what the issues really--
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:30.240]   So it argued that it basically keeps out competitors,
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.520]   because you've already-- you've manipulated someone,
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.920]   this is wonderful, so no one else can enter in.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.160]   That's what makes an antitrust which makes no sense.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.240]   But I do have to say that for a long time,
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.840]   a lot of people felt that in the age of the internet,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.960]   advertising is less useful and necessary, certainly less useful.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.960]   And maybe that's why there's a backlash against advertising.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.680]   There's a lot of ad blocking going on, a lot of ad skipping going on.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.600]   I don't need to hear this.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.760]   Oh, there's a lot of terrible advertising.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.640]   Well, that's true too.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.800]   In fact, the only ads we don't skip are the most manipulative ones.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.760]   Right?
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.840]   They'll get you crying a tear.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.440]   Google's really good at those manipulative ads, or you're crying a tear.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.800]   That's manipulative.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.360]   I don't know.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.760]   I don't think the premise of this is completely far off.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.040]   Admittedly, it's shooting me in the foot to say that,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.440]   because that's the only way I make a living is throughout.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.640]   But how is it the antitrust?
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.040]   The antitrust.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.840]   The antitrust.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.520]   Yeah, that's the part of my bio.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:33.040]   Yeah, I mean, it would come down to that
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.360]   whether the courts have said you can't do persuasive ads.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   And maybe it's not antitrust, but whatever.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.480]   Is it-- so really, the title of this is the obsolescence
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.720]   of advertising in the information age.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.000]   Would you agree to that?
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.520]   Is advertising obsolete?
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.200]   Advertising as it was.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.800]   Attention-based advertising, yes.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.760]   It's obsolete.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.400]   Not trusted.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:52.720]   Yes.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.920]   You have a product that is indistinguishable from another product,
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.320]   for instance Coca-Cola versus Pepsi.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.840]   Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.480]   There's a difference.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.280]   Now I may be bicola.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.320]   And I can't--
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.880]   But I can tell you that there is a difference.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.040]   All right, well, let me think of a commodity then.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.520]   I don't know.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.760]   Farmers John Bacon versus Westfield Ham Bacon.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.640]   I don't know.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   There are commodity products out there,
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.240]   and the only distinguishing feature is there is none.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.560]   So my pork bellies are better than your pork bellies,
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.280]   because mine--
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:23.760]   Gasoline.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.520]   Gasoline's a good one.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.080]   With techrelene, it's got detergent--
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.200]   Tiger in your tank.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.480]   Tiger in your tank.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.800]   That's persuasive because there is no difference.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.840]   But don't those companies-- doesn't SO need--
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.280]   SO.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.520]   Doesn't SO need those--
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.200]   Well, that was the tiger in your tank.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:43.680]   I know.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.400]   I'll go Leo.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.200]   Doesn't SO need to do that?
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.800]   Otherwise, shallle eat their lunch.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.720]   The first reference this guy has to something
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.440]   that supports his claim about marketing
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.120]   and advertising and antitrust is from a case from the '50s.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.200]   Like '56.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.560]   OK, so maybe--
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.800]   It was moral panic in its day that advertising--
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.880]   This was the whole Vince Pac--
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.440]   Vance Packard.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.400]   Vance Packard.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.280]   Vance Pickard.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:09.840]   Vance Packard.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.400]   Yeah, Vince Waders.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.440]   Pitten Breswaders.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.400]   Subliminal advertising,
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:21.600]   which all of this moral panic stuff treats everybody but you as sheeple.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.240]   As a child.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.560]   Right?
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.000]   Everybody is vulnerable to this horrible force,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:26.640]   but not me.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.080]   I'm somehow-- I'm OK.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.200]   That's the same thing that everybody else--
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.160]   That's the same thing that nobody else--
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:30.960]   argument as well.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.760]   You can't distinguish your fake news story,
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.440]   so I have to choose for you.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.240]   Right.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.200]   Right.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.560]   I mean, some people cannot.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.320]   Let's be real.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.360]   I think it's pretty clear.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.200]   I had a conversation with someone nearby
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.000]   who believes that 5G caused COVID.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.720]   What?
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.040]   Really?
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.880]   The government is trying to--
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.200]   Oh.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.440]   --and chemtrails, like you name it.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.400]   All the hotspots.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:56.800]   So.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.840]   Like, keywords.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.200]   There are some soft brains.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.480]   Some more just like--
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.280]   Some more just like me describe--
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.120]   Let me describe just a part of this conversation.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.720]   So if you mentioned someone else, David Ick or Icky,
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.800]   or whatever his name is, this lunatic
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.240]   former footballer who has written books and been on TV,
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.160]   espousing conspiracy theories,
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.400]   who literally believes that some people are lizards.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.720]   And so I mentioned that this man's clearly mentally ill.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.960]   And this guy said--
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.680]   The guy said--
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.360]   So he said, "OK, so the lizard thing is a little weird,
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.800]   but he does make some good points."
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.240]   [laughter]
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.480]   The alien reptilian legacy.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.520]   They were aliens.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.320]   So I was on a thing today, which is very good,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.640]   which is going on still today and tomorrow.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   And it's called Reset Everything.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.800]   At ResetEverything.events.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.400]   Guy put together 24 hours of programming.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.600]   I did a thing about media.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.600]   There were things from doctors, other things.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.720]   Oh, I like it.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.360]   Really pretty interesting.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.800]   But there was a panel discussion.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.080]   And Professor I know was on it,
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.440]   and I recommended the chibi on it,
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.240]   and there were some others.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.520]   And then a guy who's all involved in crypto
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   tried to argue to me against expertise.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.720]   [laughter]
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.160]   [sighs]
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.280]   What do you say?
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:19.680]   I can't--
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.560]   I just--
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.000]   What does he have against expertise?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.440]   Well, you know, it's basically anti-institutional.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.080]   That's what we are today.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.840]   And that's why people aren't trusting science.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.640]   And they don't trust news.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.680]   They don't trust educators.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.640]   And they don't trust professors.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.760]   They don't trust the government.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.920]   And so they want to tear it down.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.960]   And that's where we are.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.680]   Yeah, the institutions haven't been great,
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.280]   and they deserve to be slapped around,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.760]   and they need to adapt, but without them entirely.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.240]   Actually, the title of your--
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.040]   What's happening?
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.080]   The title of your 6.30 AM talk, my time.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.120]   Your time.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.560]   Was in the crisis journalism must amplify expertise
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.680]   in the aftermath we must rebuild from the ashes.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.880]   Good titles.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.600]   Good titles.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.560]   You're good at titles.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.720]   So this was a good--
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.320]   I think he might have edited it.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.680]   But this is a guy named Sebastian Couture, Canadian.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.640]   He said it's much nicer than I do.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.960]   Put together, it's pretty nice.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.640]   It's still going on right now.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   I just hope if we hit the reset button,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.120]   that everything is not in career font in the future.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.440]   - From a comic sans. - Better than a comic sans.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.760]   I guess.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.520]   You know, though, I was talking to somebody
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.600]   about the sort of distrust of expertise
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.120]   and institutions, and I was saying in a way,
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.760]   I mean, that's what journalists are trained
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.080]   to be skeptical of things, right?
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.280]   To question what the government says,
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.760]   or to question what experts say.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.960]   And that's a good thing.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.840]   But it almost seems like people take it to extremes.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.000]   So we're going to--
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.120]   Question expertise, but trust expertise,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.040]   and we're not going to get rid of advertising.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.760]   As Eppin settled, we're good.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.800]   But we'd like to have haircuts.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.360]   But we do desperately need haircuts.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.640]   - A Ken some odd words. - Tweaking.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.960]   Was there any story before we get to the change log,
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.720]   Matthew, that you want us to cover?
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.600]   I did.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.960]   Well, I haven't actually looked into it that much,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.200]   but I was looking at the Facebook's new sort of--
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.240]   Chatbot, I guess, an open source.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.360]   Chatbot, Blender.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.480]   There's been Microsoft, Tae, the racist chatbot.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.280]   Turned raises in about eight hours.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.920]   Yeah, because people will game anything they can't.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.440]   So this is Blender.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.240]   It's an open domain chatbot outperforms others
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.520]   in terms of engagement.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.360]   Also feels more human.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.560]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.720]   So speaking of moral panic, Tae was pretty human.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.400]   So I don't know where we can try this.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.920]   They've released the code.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.000]   As a combination of years of research,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.800]   we've announced we've built an open source blender,
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.720]   the largest open domain chatbot.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.680]   Well, let me see if I can go--
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.880]   when they were it says we built.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.680]   Now, see, here's a Cornell scholarly article on recipes
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.000]   for building an open domain chatbot.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.080]   So I don't know if anybody's done it yet.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.800]   Here's video.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.600]   I just think they have a demo.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.240]   Interesting.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.160]   Hi, how are you today?
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:34.560]   I'm good.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.120]   How are you?
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.320]   Do you have a favorite food?
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.680]   Mine is lobster.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.440]   Doing well, my favorite food is cake.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.360]   I just bought one because I got promoted at work.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.200]   Congratulations on the promotion.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:43.840]   What kind--
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.600]   I don't know who the bot is, actually.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.520]   I think I'm doing the bot, right?
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.040]   Congratulations on the promotion.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.080]   What kind of work do you do?
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.440]   I work in software.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.480]   Oh, thanks so much.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.560]   I just want to make my parents proud.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.000]   I'm an engineer.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.920]   I'm sure they will be very proud of you.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.480]   What type of engineering do you work in?
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   I am an environmental engineer.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   What's it like to work in software?
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.520]   It can be a lot of work, but it is very rewarding.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.960]   Do you enjoy your job?
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.520]   I love it.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.920]   It's very important to protect the environment.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.880]   That's great.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.000]   Do you have any hobbies?
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.760]   I like to play tennis in my spare time.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.000]   I have to say, blender is on the spectrum.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.160]   I'm not very coordinated, so I don't play sports.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.760]   I do like to play the guitar, though.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.880]   That's awesome.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.360]   I've always wanted to learn how to play an instrument.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.200]   What kind of music do you play?
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.640]   Mostly alternative rock.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.000]   That's cool.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.840]   I like alternative rock as well.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.600]   What are your some of your favorite bands?
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.680]   I like Modest Mouse and The Smashing Pumpkins.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.360]   What is the song of the man concert?
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.960]   I love the Smashing Pumpkins.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.880]   I saw them in concert a few years ago.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.720]   What's your favorite Smashing Pumpkins song?
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.480]   Mine is today.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.080]   Today is a great song.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:50.400]   Bye.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.760]   I know.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.520]   My favorite song of theirs is searching geek USA.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.240]   Working.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:56.720]   Working.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.960]   That's an amazing track, too.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.240]   You have great taste.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.400]   Well, I'm so glad we had this conversation.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.560]   The human being didn't sound that human.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.760]   They both were awful.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.400]   They sounded particularly.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.640]   I don't want to have this conversation.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.160]   Did you see a channel member who did it?
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.840]   They got two chatbots to talk to each other.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.800]   Did you see that?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.160]   Yeah, they had like an Amazon Echo and a Google voice or something.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.040]   Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.080]   Going back and forth.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.680]   One of them said that they loved them and the other one.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.160]   It got weird quite quickly.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.560]   It got weird.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.400]   Kind of the story of this whole show.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.480]   It got weird.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.120]   So I don't know where I can play with Blender.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.760]   I wouldn't mind.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.040]   But you know, God, is it any better than Eliza was 100 years ago?
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.240]   I mean, do we even care?
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.000]   It isn't one of the things that I find interesting about it is how hard it is.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.920]   It's not just a computer.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.880]   It's complicated.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.520]   It's hard because human beings are hard.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:08.000]   Well, and we have a very highly developed sense of detecting off humans
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.880]   so that we can either run away as fast as possible or slay them.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.160]   So I think that actually, this is why it's so challenging,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.640]   is more than even making something that sounds human,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:30.560]   is fooling this biologically highly evolved sense that we have for what is normal and what is not.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.760]   Very hard.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.720]   I could see, you know, especially for people who find it difficult to talk to other human beings,
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.400]   but whatever their problems might be if we could get them working.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:47.680]   It did seem that obviously clearly we're aiming at empathy, right?
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.960]   Or reflection and empathy.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.600]   Maybe they are trying to make a Blender psychiatrist.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.040]   All right.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.400]   I think we can play the drums now.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.920]   Jeff, he is a drummer after all.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.120]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   Oh man.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.520]   Right on the money.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.960]   Boom.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.560]   Google meet video conferencing.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.240]   The stuff that the enterprise paid so much for now free for all.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.080]   You need is a Gmail account or Google account.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.320]   Obviously threatened by the incredible growth of Zoom.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:30.080]   Unfortunately, you do have to have a Google account to participate.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.720]   You can create free meetings of up to 100 people can last any amount of time,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.440]   although after September 30th restrictions may return.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.080]   But you can't just join the meeting by clicking a link as you can with Zoom.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.760]   You'll have to be logged into your Google account.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.320]   I think a lot of people are logged in and Google says we do this so that there won't be any Zoom
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.120]   bombing.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.400]   This is that thing where you have to.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.720]   Well, I saw it today for the first time.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.640]   And I was in the recent everything and it was just in the comments.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.680]   And somebody came in and they what motivates someone they put in the N word.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.400]   Like 200 times before somebody could just want the account.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.000]   What do you get?
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.280]   What was the purpose?
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:07.920]   And what do you get?
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.880]   I guess.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:09.680]   Just idiots.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.480]   I don't know.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.600]   It's always it's puzzled.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.120]   Endless puzzlement.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:15.680]   I don't know.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.360]   You all you're tempted to say, well, that's just a teenager,
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.640]   but it's not often it's a grown human with a day job and everything.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.920]   And it doesn't say anything about mankind and it doesn't really say anything about the Zoom.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.200]   It doesn't say anything about the internet.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.120]   It says something about one idiot.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.840]   Yeah, it's not even it's not even clever or interesting.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.640]   It's just dumb.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.200]   You didn't know what Alfred said.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.520]   Alfred E. Newman?
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.800]   No, Alfred the Butler.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.840]   When it Alfred the Butler.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.520]   In the Batman begins, I think.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.600]   People just want to watch the world burn.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.000]   Yes.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.920]   Perfect line.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.840]   In fact, I think I can make a meme out of that.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.360]   Well done.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:53.840]   Well done.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.480]   Some people.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.800]   Google now warns you if your search terms are going to get you great results.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:06.080]   So Google will now alert you if there aren't any good results for your search terms.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.960]   I would really like to see trigger this, but I don't know how.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.840]   It will also off because my terms are only so good.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.960]   It will also offer tips on helping you reformulate your terms.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.920]   It'll be rolling out in the US first.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.960]   I think I could find this insulting.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.560]   Well, here's the example Google gave.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.520]   Let's see what happens.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:35.840]   Minus B plus or minus square root B M.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.120]   And it did give me a result.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.760]   So maybe it hasn't rolled out yet.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.960]   That was their example.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.080]   That was the example.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.920]   Here's what it was supposed to do.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.360]   It looks like there aren't any great matches for your search.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.080]   Try using words that might appear on the page you're looking for.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.600]   For example, cake recipes.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.160]   Sure.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.560]   Somebody types minus B plus or minus square root B.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.360]   They want a cake recipe.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.320]   They want a cake recipe.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.080]   What they're looking for is a cake recipe.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:07.840]   Oh, you know what they're looking for is the answer to their homework problems is what they're looking for.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.920]   So it hasn't rolled out to me, but kids, if you're typing in homework questions,
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.400]   Google might help you if you.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.680]   If you do it just right.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.200]   Google kills.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:21.920]   Are you ready?
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.040]   I'm ready to shed a tear.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.120]   Any time I see a sentence began, Google kills.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.080]   What'll it kill next?
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.280]   What's what's what's on the Google chopping block?
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.120]   Oh, no, shoelace.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.840]   Did you ever do you know what?
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.360]   Oh, literally never heard of it.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.280]   Oh, I've never heard of it.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.000]   Never.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.680]   But I do like business.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.800]   Charlie Woods choice of this particular picture of Sundar Pichai
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   meditatively squeezing his lower lip.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.320]   And probably some sadness over having to pull the shoe.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.800]   And he's thinking to himself, what is shoelace?
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.000]   Yeah, never heard of that.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.280]   That is that is that is.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.560]   Try to remember back.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.360]   Was that back?
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.240]   Are you sick?
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:00.880]   Shoelather.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:01.920]   What shoe?
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.240]   What?
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:02.720]   What?
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.040]   This is what what could it possibly have been?
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.040]   What would a shoelace indicate?
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.320]   This is clearly what you would get if you bring people together.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.720]   Bring people together with common interests.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.440]   Yes.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:13.840]   Yes.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.920]   Like two laces on a shoe.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.200]   Oh, I got it.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:17.600]   I got it.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.920]   You're going to use your shoelace to tie your hands down
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.440]   so you don't touch your face like that.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.720]   I think this is never heard of it.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.520]   Picture you never heard of it.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.800]   If you search on the clip art sites for the word pensive,
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.440]   you get this if you, you know, it's not April 1st, is it?
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.560]   No.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:32.880]   Okay.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.680]   Okay.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.080]   No.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.200]   So this was a real thing.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.720]   Neither of you had heard of it either.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.280]   I put that in there.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.600]   Never.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.400]   Neither of you had heard of it.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:38.800]   No.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.520]   And here's the quote.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.080]   I love it.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.080]   Given the current health crisis,
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.440]   we don't feel like now is the right time to invest further
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.560]   in this project.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.160]   That no one has heard of it.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.960]   We're done.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.600]   Here's the FAQ, the shoelace deprecation FAQ.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.720]   By the way, a lot of people reading it right now.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.960]   There's a kangaroo and a wolverine and a hippo.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.840]   Yeah, it's not that.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.800]   Why is shoelace being shut down?
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.160]   Because no one knew what the hell it was.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.080]   We're proud of the work we accomplished.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.720]   Will you reboot shoelace once mandated social distancing is ended?
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:16.960]   No.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   No.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.360]   No.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:17.760]   No.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.160]   No.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:18.160]   No.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:18.640]   No.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.120]   Just go.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:19.360]   No.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.960]   May 12th, you shoelace account will be deleted.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.320]   I want to don't you?
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:24.800]   Oh, no.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:25.680]   Well, I do.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.840]   I want to know how many user accounts there were.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.320]   Is it shoelace.google.com?
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320]   No.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.640]   Can you, uh, download your account?
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.920]   You can, I think.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.120]   Oh, I feel.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.240]   And our shoelace is.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.320]   You know, I feel bad for is the poor person who really they probably this was their.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.000]   Call their baby.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.880]   This is their baby.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:46.960]   Okay.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.840]   So here's the story.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.160]   Here's the headline July 12, 2019.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.080]   Google takes another run and social networking with shoelace.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.200]   Wow.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.760]   Running away from it now.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.680]   Can I save my data?
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.440]   It's a terrible metaphor.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.480]   If you fill out a form.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.320]   The whole shoelace thing just doesn't work.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.640]   Here's the form you have to fill out a shoelace data export.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.360]   Request.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.720]   This is a joke.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.080]   This is an elaborate prank.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.000]   I can't even get to it.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.520]   On the verge story, there's a picture of a guy with two biggest smile.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.240]   Oh, here it is.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.640]   I just moved the neighborhood with my beagle mix max.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.040]   Any dog owners around want to meet up today?
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.400]   Jeff, it was for New York.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.120]   That's why New York was in the nation only for New York.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.640]   That's why no one's ever heard.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.480]   This is the, these guys are laughing.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.280]   Someone just described.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:35.920]   You got it.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.240]   What?
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.040]   Shoelace?
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:37.520]   Shoelace?
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:37.680]   What?
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.120]   What?
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.160]   Gooble said what?
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.920]   Shoelace is not a social network.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.280]   Nope.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.080]   It's a movement to celebrate the people in places that make New York City great.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.520]   And look how they're.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.600]   You have to start off with it's not a social network.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.960]   I feel like you are on the wrong.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.440]   All they really did was make a really great web page.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.520]   Fine and join activities, New York.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   If you don't want to join like first,
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.040]   was it sort of fourth square like?
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.680]   I wonder.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.200]   Hey.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.680]   Download the app.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.880]   Go ahead, Leo.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.560]   All right.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.200]   Let's do it.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:13.680]   Do it.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.720]   Let's do it.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.200]   Let's do it.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.720]   Shoelace, hang with others.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   Rediscover.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.400]   Oh, it's on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.200]   No, you know what?
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.040]   There shouldn't there be like,
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.160]   I would bet there are people.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.360]   You know how people,
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.320]   there are people collect,
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.400]   you know, old bits of technology and try to,
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.360]   you know, get them working.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   It should be some way that you can collect old apps like this.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Because this is going to just disappear.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.200]   Like it never existed.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.040]   All the bits will go back.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.120]   There'll be another one.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.080]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.560]   I'm down.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:44.960]   Another one.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.560]   Hang with others.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.760]   IRL.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.800]   That's the tag line.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.160]   Oh, all the kids say that.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.040]   Oh, so much for that.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.560]   This is like an event.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.440]   That's why it's not.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.800]   Oh, it's like actually get together.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.400]   That's why it's dead now.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.360]   Oh, well, that's not the one.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.200]   No one thinks it's like, first word.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.360]   Well, Mona, it's not like,
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.240]   first squares.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.760]   It's saying, oh, you like skating?
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.560]   I like music.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.840]   Let's all get together.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.720]   Currently trending.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.000]   Mr. Goodmark, I think.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.920]   Sign in with Google.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:16.080]   So I'm going to, oh, I don't actually have to sign in.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:16.560]   Do I?
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.720]   You know who I am.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.760]   Do you know who I am?
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.480]   It says unable to sign in anyway.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.960]   Should I say it's built by Area 120,
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.320]   which is their research thing?
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.600]   So this is an experiment.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.920]   Yeah, but a ill-timed experiment.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.560]   Because of course, no one's getting together.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.200]   So bye-bye, shoelace.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.320]   Just kind of untie that one.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.360]   Not bad.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.000]   Finally,
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.840]   finally, Waze is finally testing lane guidance for navigation.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.360]   So Elon Musk's Tesla has shipped out a thing
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.400]   that knows stop signs, red lights can drive you all the way.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.680]   Waze,
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.400]   trying to keep up,
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.120]   is going to show you
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.240]   which lane you should be.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.440]   And if you're going to exit here.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.120]   Which is handy.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:05.840]   Yeah, but don't.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.120]   Does anybody else do that?
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.120]   Stay in the second lane from the left.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.960]   Things like that.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.160]   It helps us in Hebrew.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.600]   Yeah, apparently only in Israel will you be able to use this.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.680]   I don't even know what we're looking at.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.880]   This lane guidance for Waze is starting in Israel.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   But it will work much like the navigation feature in Google
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.000]   maps, a heads up to change lanes while traveling on a multi-lane road.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:34.640]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.280]   You want that.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.040]   Yeah, that is pretty amazing how Google has left Waze in Israel and alone to develop on their own.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:41.760]   Right.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.080]   Good.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.080]   That's where they're based.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:44.880]   That's where it's based.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.920]   But they share data, right?
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.320]   Yes.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:46.560]   Yes.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.400]   Oh, yeah, they absolute you.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.520]   Yeah, okay.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.160]   They didn't at first though.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.160]   No, they didn't at first.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.840]   And the reason Waze didn't do it,
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.360]   according to a Reddit post,
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.880]   by Waze map editor, is they were worried it would be distracting.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.320]   The voice is sufficient.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.200]   They didn't want to show too much because it would...
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.800]   All right, here's a test.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.280]   Here's a test.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.160]   When you use any, both of you, when you use any of you,
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.200]   the apps, do you do voice or visual or both?
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.560]   I don't remember...
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.520]   Not a hard question.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.800]   What was it like driving?
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.480]   When you were a kid...
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.320]   Yeah, I know.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.120]   When you were a kid...
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.800]   Did you get in the car and drive places, Daddy?
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.760]   I use both, but my car's nav will show it on the screen in front of me,
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.600]   as well as the voice.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.960]   That's why I hate the voice.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.360]   Don't do the voice.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.480]   Why don't I fall only to the voice?
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.480]   I hate the voice.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.440]   Yeah, the voice is too late, usually when the voice tells you.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.240]   I need to kind of get more advanced information.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.240]   Your wife won't look at the screen.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:58.960]   She'll only listen.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.160]   Pretty much.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.640]   Matthew?
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:10.320]   So my wife and I have a thing where she turns on
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:16.080]   ways and the voice, and then also gives me other directions at the same.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.120]   Does it's fun to boss you around?
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:25.360]   Did she disagree with ways?
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.000]   Oh, yeah. Did you see the tweet from...
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.440]   I can't remember who it was, but they said,
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.280]   "We have a fun game my wife and I played during Covid.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.280]   It's called 'Why Do You Do It That Way?'
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.400]   And there are no winners."
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.520]   I'm just...
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.640]   How long have you been married?
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.040]   37 years.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.440]   I'm just glad to hear that you can be married 37 years
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.040]   and still have those conversations.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:49.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:50.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.120]   That's encouraging.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.560]   That's...
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.680]   Why do you do it that way?
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:58.080]   Early on, Lisa and I would fight over which way the silver
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.920]   where she'd go in the dishwasher with...
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.480]   ...forkatines up or handle up, right?
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.840]   Which one do it that way?
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.280]   I don't remember anymore because she won.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:10.320]   So whatever way she wanted to do it, the way we do it.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.400]   The end you use goes up, obviously.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.280]   Everybody knows that.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.480]   Yes.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.040]   That's right.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:19.200]   I was mistakenly of the end you use goes down.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.640]   Because you want to...
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.640]   When you empty it, I want to take it by the handle.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.680]   I want to take it by the handle.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:24.960]   I don't want to touch the tines.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.480]   Right.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.680]   It doesn't make that harder.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.560]   Now that we're all sanitized, I guess if the forks are up,
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.400]   if the tines are up, it washes better.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.760]   Yes.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.440]   This is a theory, but honestly,
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.800]   a wash is just fine either way.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.440]   I'm beyond it.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.560]   It doesn't make any difference.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.960]   Then the other thing we fight, and I also...
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.160]   I mean, I lost them all, but I don't like putting pots.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.240]   The toilet paper roll?
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.160]   No, no, nobody disagrees over that.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.440]   It's always got over the top.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.160]   And then there's the...
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.760]   Who thinks it goes out of the bottom?
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.560]   No one.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.000]   So, uh-huh.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.160]   So my daughter had a counter argument,
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.760]   which is very powerful.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.000]   If you have a pet, like say a cat,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.560]   if it's over the front, the top,
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.320]   then your pet can basically unroll the whole thing
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.280]   by right exact swiping it.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.720]   Whereas if it's over the back,
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.480]   it's harder for them to do that.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.680]   Very good.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.640]   Very good.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.520]   That's a good argument.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.040]   That's a good argument.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.920]   That's a good one.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.840]   Is that from experience or theory?
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.160]   Yes.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:24.560]   No, no.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.560]   Real life experience.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.000]   Oh, it's a good theory.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:28.560]   I like it.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.600]   And that, my friends, is the Google change log.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.000]   Plus a little life floor from Matthew Ingram.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.120]   I'm glad you could be here.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.240]   We miss Stacy.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.600]   She'll be back next week,
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.400]   but I'm glad Matthew you could be here.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.080]   She was a little angry with me last week.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.120]   Did you hear that?
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.000]   Uh-oh.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.840]   No, she was mad because we were looking at some sourdough starter.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:59.280]   And I said, that is a mighty fine looking starter.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.000]   And she thought I was talking about the woman who created it,
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.040]   not the starter.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.600]   Oh, geez.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.400]   And she really wanted to punch me.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.840]   But fortunately, all was explained.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.960]   It was a comma-blunder.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.440]   Okay.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.000]   Okay.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.920]   Remember that, Jeff?
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:16.880]   We were looking at it.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   It was a woman who built a Twilio
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.480]   employee, it built a lid that you put on your starter.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.960]   And it measures its humidity and expansion.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.880]   So you have always this feedback.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.280]   Wow.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.440]   And they used the cell network and everything.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.080]   It was really clever.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.040]   That would be handy.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.640]   And my daughter was making some.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.360]   Admittedly, she had some mighty fine looking starter.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.000]   I'm just saying.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.040]   I can't--
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.840]   So do you know the oldest known starter?
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.080]   No.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:42.640]   How old is it?
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.560]   Is it the Boudin starter in San Francisco?
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.440]   I'm putting it in right now.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.160]   Putting it right now.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.920]   So as old as the Boudin starter.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.720]   Your other?
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.200]   Because--
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.640]   Well, according to a local story,
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.040]   it's a classic Newcastle woman maintained.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:53.840]   I don't feel like you're not.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.640]   Oh, that's pretty old.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.600]   But I think the sourdough--
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.160]   100-20-year-old starter, but it's not the oldest.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:02.720]   That's typical of Newcastle, wherever that might be.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.040]   Is that New Jersey?
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.200]   I doubt it.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.400]   This is our trip to you.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.520]   Maybe--
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.760]   Here's an guardian story.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.720]   Rising fame.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.680]   Experts heralded Canadian woman's 120-year-old starter.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.320]   I'm going to tell you the oldest sourdough--
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320]   That was a Boudin is 160.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.120]   That's what I thought.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.720]   It is 160.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.040]   You know what?
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.960]   This guy who has a sourdough starter music, he--
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.480]   This frustrates me.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.760]   Yeah, we had that on the show.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.840]   This is an example of Google really making a mess of the news.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.400]   What do we find if I search "oldest sourdough starter"
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.040]   Lucille and a 120-year-old starter?
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.640]   Right under it, the 160-year-old starter.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.840]   But then right under that,
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.920]   man makes sourdough from a 4,500-year-old Egyptian yeast.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:54.400]   Does that count?
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.200]   Sourd--
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.120]   You made it in a traditional way, too.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.960]   It's a Egyptian sourdough.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.920]   Instead, it was a little hard.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.480]   It was a little hard.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.240]   You can, if you make sourdough,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.360]   roll it.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.080]   You can put it in a paste on a silicone
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.120]   piece of paper, roll it, flatten it,
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.800]   roll it and dry it, and it'll be just--
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.440]   It's yeast.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   It's just like any other yeast.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.360]   So that's probably what the Egyptians did.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.320]   And he made some bread from it.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.560]   Truthfully--
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.120]   The made it stuff.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:23.360]   I don't--
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.440]   Well, I discovered now what to do with sourdough discard.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.320]   I want to share this with everybody because it's--
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:30.880]   Yeah, what do you do?
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.600]   It was a life-changing revelation to me.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.080]   Okay.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.480]   Thanks to my friends at King Arthur Flower.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.920]   So anybody who's made sourdough knows
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.400]   that you have to feed it, right?
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.080]   Because it's a living organism,
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.800]   so you give it fresh flour and water every single day.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.760]   And if you think about it, that means it gets bigger,
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.520]   and you have a lot of extra sourdough every day,
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.240]   like up or two.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.960]   And for the longest time for years,
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:35:59.920]   I've been throwing it out.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.240]   Like, what do you do with this?
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.960]   Well, it turns out you do a lot of wonderful things,
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:10.080]   but there is nothing better than King Arthur Flower's
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.880]   sourdough discard crumpets.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.680]   I am going to gain a thousand pounds
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:23.440]   because this takes no time.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.760]   You take a cup of sourdough starter,
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.480]   a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of sugar,
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.680]   and the key ingredient,
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:32.640]   three-eighths of a teaspoon of baking soda.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.160]   That's what makes the little bubbles.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.600]   I had no idea.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.120]   You mix it all together,
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.520]   you heat your griddle on medium-low heat,
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.160]   you pour it out.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.080]   Now, you're better off if you've got those rings,
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:42.640]   which I got.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.480]   I actually ordered on Amazon.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.120]   I ordered little crumpet rings,
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.400]   and you pour them into the ring,
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.560]   one inch high and four inches across,
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.160]   and you cook them five minutes on one side,
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.280]   flip them, cook them three minutes
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.120]   on the other side until they're golden brown.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.920]   It's the best crumpets you've ever had in your life,
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.760]   and the problem is it makes four.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.280]   I eat them all immediately.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.440]   Oh, warm.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.600]   Oh, look.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.200]   A little clotted cream.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.160]   Oh, my God.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.080]   That's the next thing I got to make clotted cream.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.920]   Oh, what is clotted cream?
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:12.720]   How do you make clotted cream?
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.800]   You take cream and you just really thick cream.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Cook it in a double boiler for a long time.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.600]   It's not worth it.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.080]   Really?
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:18.880]   Oh.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.640]   It is worth it.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.320]   Also, to kill you, it is worth it.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.840]   Well, the crumpets are going to kill me.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.880]   The cream won't just make it go down easier.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.240]   Okay.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.480]   I made these last night.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.160]   I made these this morning.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.200]   I get a cup of sourdough and discard every single day.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.560]   It's crumpets forever.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.880]   I can't let it go to waste sourdough pretzels.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.760]   Did I see that there?
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.200]   Oh, this is good.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:45.760]   That'd be good.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.280]   By the way, this is my pick of the week.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.800]   I'm going to just give it to you right now.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.160]   King, Arthur Flowers, sourdough discard recipes.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.440]   It's a whole page.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.520]   By the way, I've made the classic sourdough waffles.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.600]   Best waffles you've ever had in your entire life.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.200]   I use sourdough cinnamon buns.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:03.680]   They're pretty good.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.560]   Sourdough cinnamon.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:05.840]   That's sourdough red.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.560]   Oh, cracker.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.480]   Chocolate cake.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.720]   Oh, by the way, I found this out from my father,
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.640]   writing orders on Instacart.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.440]   There appears to be a nationwide shortage of wheat thins.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.680]   Really?
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.520]   You could probably make sourdough wheat thins.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.240]   No, he won't please.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.960]   The reason you do sourdough start is because nobody gets yeast.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.040]   There is a shortage of yeast, but you don't need yeast.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:29.520]   That's right.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.640]   You got your own sourdough.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.880]   I didn't know.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.160]   So we tried to make it here and it didn't work that well.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.320]   And I didn't realize that you're basically
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.560]   trying to encourage yeast out of the air.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.360]   Yeah, it's coming from there.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.000]   Wherever you are.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:44.960]   There's yeast everywhere.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.480]   It's also happening everywhere.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:46.960]   It's also happening where you are.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.720]   But depending on where you are, the humidity,
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.560]   the local environment, the...
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.920]   Yeah, it's perfect here.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:54.720]   Yeah, no, we did.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.200]   You did.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.960]   There's yeast floating through the air at the time.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.880]   So it depends on where you are that it can even change the flavor.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.440]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.320]   The terroir.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.280]   The terroir.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.520]   The terroir of sourdough is very, very distinct.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.960]   Everybody has a sourdough, I expect.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.920]   I know.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.240]   That whole Instagram feed is like basically baking.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:12.720]   It's all sourdough.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.120]   Like what?
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.800]   We're going to get out of this.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.880]   The COVID don't kill you.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.400]   The cholesterol will.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.960]   COVID-19, they call it.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.040]   Oh, this is the COVID-19.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:23.920]   I got it right here.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:30.400]   Do you want to share a thing or a pick, Mr. Matthew Ingram?
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:39.200]   So this was one in the rundown, I guess, which I love for sort of a weird reason.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.400]   I love the Boston Dynamics spot.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.360]   Oh, yeah, the dog robot.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.680]   So they're trying to kind of make them useful for telemedicine, I guess.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.080]   So they...
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.160]   A little un-sullaby.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.080]   So you have this sort of frightening, headless dog thing.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:58.560]   Oh, God.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.840]   And then you have an eye pad with your coat of your face on it.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.520]   So this looks to me like something you would see in the game Half-Life.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.080]   Coming from the audience.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.000]   And this is going to the rooms of people who have fevers and deliriums.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.560]   Seriously.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.680]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.520]   I think it's a winner.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.480]   It's 100%.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.840]   I'm your doctor.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.800]   Does it make the sound?
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.280]   Let me see.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.920]   I got to hear the sound because I love the...
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.520]   Oh, see, they didn't put a video in here.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.720]   TechCrunch needs a video.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:31.600]   Anyway, I think it's definitely...
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.960]   Hello.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.160]   I'm your doctor.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.840]   I'm spot.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.520]   Lemma, come over and visit you.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:44.240]   And all you have to do is hook spot up with like a syringe,
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.840]   maybe injection mechanism, maybe some, you know.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.840]   That's what it needs.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.040]   It just needs...
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.560]   Needle.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.520]   By the way, a little sourdough tip for you, Mr. Matthew Ingram,
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.320]   rye flour.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.400]   The rye has some very nice yeasts.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.440]   If your sourdough is lagging or seems a little tired,
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.840]   a little rye flour will pick it right up.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.760]   And it doesn't change the flavor a lot.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.920]   I only make mine from hand ground, stone ground,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.720]   spelt berries.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.160]   And it's fabulous.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.440]   Everything I do is whole wheat.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.040]   I don't use that white flour.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.080]   It's all whole wheat.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:24.960]   That's why it's okay.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:28.320]   If I eat pork, it's a day.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.280]   Poor pound limit.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.720]   A day every single day for the rest of my life,
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.240]   which won't be very long.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.240]   Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:36.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.440]   A few choices here.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.160]   Let me just ask you this.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.120]   Have you seen the dog, Derby, the guy who...
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.080]   The sports commentator who does his dogs?
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:46.640]   I love it.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.840]   You see the rematch?
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.040]   No.
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:49.840]   Is there a new one?
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.600]   No, I don't think we're allowed to play this.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.400]   We're going to get in trouble.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.000]   Oh, I don't care what Carson says.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.520]   He's a Harvard man.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.120]   Let's listen and watch.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.480]   You need this out.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.160]   So into the final minute and all of
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.800]   in possession of this is where Mabel is strong.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.080]   So I should explain.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.000]   You got a black lab and a golden lab
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.920]   sitting next to each other, looking at each other.
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.880]   The black lab has an orange dog bone in its mouth.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.000]   He's in possession.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:16.640]   Sing the game.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.400]   Using that intensity, we saw it in the semi-final,
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.480]   staring at a slam-toned cloth rabbit
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.160]   for over seven and a half minutes.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.560]   And perhaps a few signs of overconfidence from arrival,
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.280]   a bit of show-boating overcast to be careful.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.560]   There's the change from the classic hold,
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.760]   still placed in the outside,
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.720]   the great technique and a glance at the youngster
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.200]   who shows little emotion, but her mind will be empty.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.480]   Twenty seconds to go now,
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.360]   all of closing in on victory and that coveted prize
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.120]   of being told she's a very good dog.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.960]   One part of control and a switch.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.760]   Now Mabel's sensing this might be a chance,
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   still waiting, still believing.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.160]   And you wonder what Olive is doing here?
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.000]   Only has to hold on going to the upright,
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.560]   though high tariff with no opposable thumbs,
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.160]   high risk at this stage.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.840]   And it's gone and Mabel takes it.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.000]   No mercy from the younger dog.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.840]   Who takes this victory just as time runs out of famous wind,
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.560]   built on patience and sheer belief.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:17.040]   And Olive only thoughts of what might have been,
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.480]   but only herself to blame.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.680]   She's given this one away and that will hurt most of all.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.960]   Oh my god, that's freaking brilliant.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:25.760]   Isn't that brilliant?
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.800]   Isn't that just great?
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.840]   Mr. Andrew Carter, C-O-T-T-E-R on the Twitter.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.040]   He has a new one up while he's waiting for a rematch.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.480]   There's a new one up on his Twitter feed of them doing
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.440]   a synchronous swimming.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.680]   But if you want to watch that one too.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.160]   This is incredible.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.200]   I have to say.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.600]   Lian eating three kilos of grass and upsetting a small child,
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.240]   but Mabel finishing so strongly here,
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.560]   taking herself off to stand in this pent upon.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.000]   Just to please herself.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.360]   It's not even that warm today.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.560]   Just standing,
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.480]   letting all the unpleasantness soak in.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.280]   This might well have shaken Olive,
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.200]   wondering now if she needs to go back and roll
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.360]   in that very poorly squirrel in the trees,
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360]   which got us shouted at a few moments ago.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.000]   But you might have to try something
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.720]   because Mabel is piling on the pressure here,
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.120]   doing nothing at all and that's the beauty of it.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.080]   Come on, I have to get.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.400]   There we are, no recognition,
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.080]   no recall whatsoever.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.240]   A stair that says I'm doing what I want,
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.080]   and I have zero respect for you.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.200]   And there might be a move by Olive,
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.440]   a response to this effort by the youngster.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.320]   Yes, there it is, joining arrival again.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.560]   Absolutely no purpose to it.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.880]   Not fetching anything, just wandering around,
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.200]   synchronised spin, a nice touch.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.080]   - I wonder.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.240]   - Now both of them wondering how to finish this off.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.160]   There's no point in shaking yet,
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.120]   you're still in the water.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.840]   There's the hot, beautifully done.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:50.480]   - Yeah.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.320]   - And there we are, shaking all over my jeans.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.400]   Even Olive enjoyed that one.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.080]   She knows that she can still take it
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.560]   by shaking over the furniture back at home.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.760]   (laughing)
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.000]   - Yeah, I'll put the apology in for a few minutes.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.440]   - Oh, so what does this guy do?
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.920]   - He's a sports, yeah, he's a sportscaster.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.600]   - Or he's just bored tears.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.960]   - Oh, but he's so good.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.520]   - Do you saw the original one?
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:12.800]   - Yes, we played the original one.
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.360]   - The original one they're eating.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.040]   - Yeah, it's really, well,
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.240]   and even before that he was doing people waiting at a bus shelter
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.720]   and he's really great.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.400]   I just, I think this is, was he a golf commentator?
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.040]   Is it cricket?
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:25.440]   What is his?
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.160]   - I think it was golf,
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:26.640]   I think it was golf,
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.240]   because he had a funny one in his feet about a Venn diagram
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.520]   of people who are here for boring golf things
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.760]   and people are here for the dogs and there's no overlap.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.520]   - Oh, there he is.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.600]   And it's not really what you'd expect him to look like.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.240]   Andrew Cotter, Mr. Andrew Cotter.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.960]   Broadcasting, hosting, writing.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:50.560]   And Andrew, you have a standing invitation to join us
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:56.320]   on the show and anytime to a play-by-play, he's in the UK.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.200]   - So two dogs, that's the number.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.480]   - That is really an example of how the world is so dramatically changed.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.240]   No sports, so we're watching dogs.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.560]   That's really great.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.680]   - What are better is doing?
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.560]   - Oh, so when I was at the daily news in New York,
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:24.560]   we had this horrible racist little cartoon, like Ching Chow was called.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.360]   - There was a lot of chimes.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.800]   - There was a whole chain of men, where it was off.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.280]   - Oh my God.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.320]   - Is it there, right?
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.360]   And it was in the sports section and we went on strike,
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:34.720]   we ran out of space and we ran out of money, so we got rid of it.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:41.760]   Oh my God, there was a problem, because the people who played the numbers used it.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.560]   They would count the hairs on Ching Chow's head.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.800]   - The thing, batteries can bet on anything.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.600]   - Exactly.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.720]   - So I suspect there are betters betting even on this show.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.240]   How long it will be, the over-under is a minute,
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.280]   - or whatever. - Or a panic.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.400]   - 48 minutes.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.000]   Will moral panic be mentioned?
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.320]   Will Gutenberg be mentioned both this week?
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.560]   Thank you, Matthew, for filling in.

[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.440]   - First me.

[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.880]   Are you working on a book right now?
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.640]   - What's you doing?
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.240]   - Well, I'm Gutenberg.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.720]   - Is it hard to work on a book when nothing's going on?
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.480]   - It's really hard because I try to get from COVID brain
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.800]   to Gutenberg brain is really impossible.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.640]   I thought, you don't Pete Dominic, you're a cross-pete Dominic?
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.280]   Wonderful guy, podcaster now, radio guy.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.640]   Comedy and he was just saying, so many people were learning how much the commute
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.320]   has been rotting their body and soul.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.400]   And I was about to tweet to him that, yeah,
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.200]   I thought that giving up my three hour plus commuter dad
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.480]   on the book written by now.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.200]   - Yeah, you think, like we have, we'd have all this time.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.320]   - No.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:48.640]   - No.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.280]   - And I'm listening to fewer books too.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.000]   - Yeah.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.760]   Most of I just sit staring into space wondering when my hair will stop growing.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.200]   And being envious of Matthew's beard.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.440]   - And very, very envious of Matthew's beard.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.920]   You don't even trim it? That's just obnoxious.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.560]   - I mean, a little bit when there's bits sticking out.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.800]   But it just does that.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.160]   - I mean, eventually it's going to get longer and longer, right?
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.040]   - Well, it's going to be, well,
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.800]   if Matthew originally put it up,
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.840]   my immediately put up a picture of David Letterman, of course.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.280]   - It's not a Letterman beard.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.640]   It's a beautiful beard.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.840]   It's shapely.
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.760]   It's got a nice tone and...
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.960]   - Letterman's really good.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:29.600]   He's got a...
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.400]   - He looks like a crazy man on the porch.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:32.960]   - Yeah.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.120]   - Virginia, yeah, sitting on the porch.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:35.840]   - Yeah.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.160]   - Beard.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.360]   - Well, that's a style of beard.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.200]   - It's a style indeed.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.000]   I don't mind not having a beard.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.720]   I'm thinking though that the Stikowski hair, I don't know.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:45.520]   We're going to work on it.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.280]   - Leopold.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.560]   - Leopold.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.200]   - It is just strictly different this week.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.280]   Yeah, it's gone over a line.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:53.920]   - Some is happening.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.480]   - Yeah.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.200]   - Some is happening.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.160]   It's gone over a line.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.280]   - I've got...
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.360]   Mine is getting very long.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.360]   - Swinny Todd hair.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:01.920]   It's great.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.960]   - It's great.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.720]   - Two on the sides and three on top.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.400]   - Two on the sides and three on top.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.040]   - Oh, the buzz of the number of the bazer.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.000]   - So that's the thing.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.400]   So if I've got the beard trimmer,
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.480]   it goes from one to 14,
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.960]   I guess millimeters or something, right?
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.480]   And if I used it, how bad could that be?
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.760]   - No, it looked great.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.360]   - I mean, it grows back, right?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.120]   - Steve Gibson's a girlfriend.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.080]   - How bad could it be?
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.640]   - Steve Gibson's girlfriend uses, I think, a zero on him.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:37.040]   No, zero would be nothing, right?
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.000]   Zero would be bald.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:38.880]   - Yeah, zero is nothing.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:39.280]   - So it's a little one or two.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.240]   It's a little bit short.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.840]   It's closely cropped.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.120]   It's very military.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:43.600]   It looks good.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.520]   He looks like a lieutenant colonel.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.480]   - Two on the sides and three on top.
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:46.720]   - Yeah.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.320]   - That's the way to go.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.600]   - Ladies and gentlemen, we do this week

[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.960]   I don't need to prove anything.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.400]   I'm just going to sit back and watch.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.080]   - You have a machine that helps you cheat.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.760]   - I have a cheating machine.
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.640]   That's exactly right.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.920]   In fact, I want to make pea soup in my cheating machine tonight.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.600]   It's very exciting for me.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.520]   It's a exciting moment.
