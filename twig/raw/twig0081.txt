[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google, the cloud,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600]   Huffington Post, WebOS.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.920]   We're going to talk about a lot of cool stuff this week.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   Joining us, as always, we're glad to have Gina Trapani
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   from smarterware.org.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.920]   Welcome, Gina.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.560]   Hello.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.320]   Good to be here.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.440]   Missing Leo, but great to be with you, Tom.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.280]   I know.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000]   Leo is going to be gone for a couple more twigs.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   Also with us, Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.120]   Good to see you again, Jeff.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.960]   Hello there.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.640]   You're in sunny Amsterdam.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.880]   I have lamps upside down in a hotel room outside Amsterdam,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.640]   trying to get enough light to make this work.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960]   I love that kind of camera.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.880]   Committed to the art, you are.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.440]   Yes.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.720]   I brought some Chipotle chips so that I could try to fit in
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.000]   in Leo's place.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.760]   Nice.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.080]   Now you have to crunch them into the mic really, really closely.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.920]   I did that just to talk about them.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.080]   That was like a bad video.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.480]   There you go.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.200]   How's it going?
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   You guys watched Glee?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   All right.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.280]   Leo.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160]   Who knew Glee episodes this week too?
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.240]   And that's all I'll say about it.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   It was a good week for gleeks.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.480]   Leo is steaming his way towards Antarctica.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.280]   Last we knew on Twitter, he was in the Falkland Islands,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.640]   taking pictures of penguins.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.240]   So there is your Leo Laport update.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.560]   He called it a Gen 2 Penguin.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040]   That's pretty funny.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.760]   Nice.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.080]   The live Gen 2 Penguin, not the live CD.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.520]   Right.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.200]   The live Penguin.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920]   So let's start off talking a little bit about the webOS
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.000]   announcement that came this morning.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.640]   HP announced three new devices for webOS.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.280]   The HP Touchpad.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   It's a 10-inch device, 9.7 inches, particularly, 1024 by 768 display.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.560]   The HP VIR is kind of a tiny phone.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.240]   I guess it would be similar to the PIXI.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.080]   Maybe it's a replacement for that.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.680]   It's 2.6-inch Touch display, 5 megapixel camera, 8 gigabytes
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.440]   of storage.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.680]   And the HP Pre-3, which is a portrait slider phone,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.400]   the successor to the Palm Pre-2, 3.6-inch screen, HD video,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160]   8 gig or 16 gig.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   So we're going to see the Pre-3 in summer,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.120]   the VIR in early spring, and the tablet not until summer.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.000]   And that's only for the Wi-Fi version.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   3G version comes later.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.720]   Gina, I know you were saying you didn't really
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.920]   pay that much attention to this announcement.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.200]   But are you sad to see that they've gotten rid of the name Palm?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.040]   It does feel like at the end of an era, doesn't it?
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.240]   Like Palm is kind of like the dawn of the PDA, which I guess
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.840]   we don't say that anymore, right?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.960]   I'm a little sad.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   I think they could have probably stuck with-- so it's now
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.120]   just the HP VIR.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   It's not the Palm VIR, the Palm Pre.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.320]   No, it's the HP VIR, the HP Pre-3, and the HP Touchpad.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.040]   Yeah, I mean, Touchpad is a great brand.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   I mean, HP is a great brand.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.440]   Manufactured, built, invented a lot of really important things.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.560]   But I did like the Palm brand.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.200]   It does feel kind of like the end of an era.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.680]   They're retiring, I think, a brand that was pretty good
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   and that you associated with handheld devices.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.520]   But you know, it was hasn't been in the game for a while.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.000]   Somewhere up in gadget heaven, Palm and Newton
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.440]   are talking to each other.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   Aww.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.520]   There they are.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   Look at them.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.080]   They're right next to DEC.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   An Algebraista.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.960]   The HP Touchpad dual core 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.840]   processor, 1.3 megapixel camera.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.000]   It looks like a sufficiently nice tablet, don't you think?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.520]   It doesn't.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.920]   You know, WebOS is a nice operating system.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.000]   There's one in my household.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.520]   It's not mine.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   It's my other house.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.520]   And I guess this kind of represents a commitment
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.120]   to WebOS, right?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.920]   I'm excited about good looking mobile operating systems,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.560]   kind of more competition.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   What is the usage rate of WebOS compared to iPhone,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.800]   Blackbait, RIM, Android at this point?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.080]   I'm not sure, but I imagine HP included this in their presentation
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.440]   today.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.400]   Market share is very small.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.680]   So I haven't looked through the entire presentation myself.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   I've only looked at the vital stats.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.120]   My guess is they didn't talk about the industry.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   Yeah, because they didn't want to show the really small sliver
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.920]   of the pie.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   Yeah, we're talking 25% for Android, 25% for Blackberry.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.640]   We're talking 2% for WebOS right now, I think.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   Yeah, it's small of a Cibbean, which is about to die.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.360]   Did we all catch the memo that the new Nokia CEO
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   wrote this week?
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.280]   The Burning Platform Memo, which is my favorite nickname
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.840]   for a memo since the peanut butter memo.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.960]   Exactly.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.640]   Exactly.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.360]   It was awe inspiring.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.760]   And you wonder how Nokia could have gone so far so fast
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.520]   and how even a new company, even though it's not new,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.920]   but a new business can go down so fast.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.200]   But then the second question is,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.280]   there's supposedly debating now between Android and Windows OS.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   I can't see how it makes any sense to pick Windows.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.120]   Can you?
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.480]   Why?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.240]   I think there's more worry that they're going to pick Android.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.280]   In fact, let's bring in Kevin Purdy we finally got on the line.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   He's joining us today as well.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   He's contributing editor at lifehacker.com
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   and the author of an Android book.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.560]   What's the name of your book again?
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.840]   The complete Android guide.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.920]   Complete Android guide, which you can find at completeandroidguide.com.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.400]   What do you think about the odds of Nokia going with Android,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.440]   which like Jeff says, in absentia
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.640]   seems to make some logical sense.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.280]   It does.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.760]   And they were so vehement, though, in denying an earlier
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.280]   rumor that they were going to use Windows Phone 7.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.200]   They were so kind of prideful on saying, oh no,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   we would never use Windows Phone 7 for our main OS.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.040]   It makes me a little skeptical, but I
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.720]   think it would be a great move whether or not they do it or not.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.800]   I mean, different--
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200]   Which would be going to Windows?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.680]   No, no.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.320]   Going to Android would be a really good idea,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.400]   because then they could--
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.560]   my friend had always-- some of my friends have always said
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.440]   that Android would become like Nokia, like the OS
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.720]   you don't even know you're using.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.480]   You could totally brand Android in a way such that it
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.680]   wasn't so apparent that you were using a Google operating
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.180]   system.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.640]   Nokia could totally brand and kind of image Android
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.720]   in its own image, but whether or not they do so
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.320]   is another matter.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   So is HP better off owning Palm, or could HP
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.880]   have gone to Android as well?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.120]   I mean, that's what I'm trying to get my--
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   or for that matter, Windows.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   They're a Windows vendor.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.400]   I'm trying to get my head around where this landscape goes.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   Tast iOS and Android.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.760]   Right, Jeff.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.560]   And I think that they must feel--
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.040]   they must have some confidence in the talent and the staff
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.080]   at Palm that they feel like they can come up with something
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.800]   new on their own.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.280]   Everybody liked WebOS when it came out.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   And I thought that was a pretty good competitor
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.280]   to the iPhone.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.880]   It never really managed to gain leverage.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.760]   I think that they must feel like they can go with a loan
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.800]   or come up with their own ecosystem.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.480]   But it feels like a pretty crowded market right now.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.080]   And in addition to the two phones and the tablet
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.040]   they announced, according to an All Things D report,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.120]   Group Executive VP Todd Bradley, personal systems
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.440]   group executive, said that introducing WebOS
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.600]   to our PC customers later this year
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.080]   will drastically expand the platform.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.840]   So they're sort of moving into the Chrome OS space as well.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.360]   Right.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.480]   That was kind of the bomb that dropped at the end, right?
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   Yeah, it was almost-- it was almost
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.920]   missable.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   It was kind of the end of--
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   At the end of--
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   At the end of two hours.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.760]   The two hour death march of an announcement.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.160]   Nobody could notice.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.440]   I mean, do we suspect a CR48 like offering from HP
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   that runs WebOS?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   Brave move.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.320]   I mean, if they could do it, because even Google hasn't really
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.520]   kind of released CR48 beyond the test group that they have.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.840]   Which even Google's not a part of.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.320]   Yes.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   Well, I--
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.600]   I haven't seen--
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.800]   I haven't seen an update.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.440]   I have one.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.360]   And I haven't seen an update at all for one.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.200]   I mean, they've done a few bug fixes,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.280]   but there hasn't been a huge jump forward.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.960]   Unless they're just holding it all back or something.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.280]   I'd love to see a vibrant ecosystem of Web only netbooks.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.880]   But it just doesn't seem to be happening right now.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.080]   We'll play with that for a second.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.680]   So if HP, who obviously puts out tons of Windows products,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.240]   it uses its own OS.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.160]   And if Nokia goes to something and doesn't go to Microsoft,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   is this bad news for Microsoft and Windows,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.440]   some various flavors?
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.880]   Well, it's bad news for the carriers.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.400]   The carriers are the most worried
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.720]   that Nokia would switch to Android, which I really
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   don't think is going to happen.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.320]   I mean, Steven E. Lopsenold Microsoft guy.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.560]   And you could over-interpret those sorts of things.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.000]   But it's going to be a big deal if they drop Symbian
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.080]   or go de-emphasize MIGO.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.800]   They're their other operating system.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.920]   I can't see them doing that to go to Android,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.880]   because that turns them into just another manufacturer.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.440]   And they built themselves on branding themselves
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   as a unified experience.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.320]   That's the Nokia experience.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.840]   But the carriers are worried if they go to Android
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.920]   that that will eliminate all the competition.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.600]   And all phones will be their Android or iOS
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   and predominantly Android.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.400]   And we get--
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.560]   That's what we're trying to--
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.160]   They have no more leverage anymore.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.200]   So why would you buy a HP/NAe Palm device?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.120]   What's the main selling point to go with the Mini OS?
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   I really couldn't tell you.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   I mean, they're even dropping Palm legacy support
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.160]   with WebOS 2.0, right?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.000]   Wow.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.760]   They made a big deal about how multitasking was really
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.120]   important for them.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.400]   They're playing on the whole slides metaphor even more.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.520]   It seems like they're selling position in my early read
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.840]   is that this is a higher performance product than iOS or Android.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   Do you buy-- anybody buy that?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.160]   Higher performance.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.280]   Those are my words, not HPs.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.840]   Until you put it on actual hardware and give it to actual people
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.520]   and they use it in their actual day.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.200]   Yeah, I want to see this thing in action
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.400]   where I can pick it up and play with it.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.560]   Because I was actually very skeptical of the BlackBerry
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   playbook until I got my hands on it at CES.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.440]   And it worked great.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.920]   And it has true multitasking and the ability
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.160]   to have a couple of things running at the same time
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.960]   and switch back and forth really fast.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   That has impressed me.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.320]   I don't think that's going to save BlackBerry on the tablet,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.480]   but I think it will at least prevent them
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.120]   from getting entirely left behind.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.880]   I want to see WebOS in person before I make any judgments
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.120]   there.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.680]   All right, I don't want to jump ahead here,
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.600]   but I'm dying to ask Gina, now that you're
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   getting some details about the first Android tablet,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   are you going to fork out in her box plus a contract?
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.280]   Yeah, what are we looking at?
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   February 24th, is the release date for the Zoom?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.280]   Well, that's the leaked Best Buy page date.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.560]   Motorola still hasn't given us an official date,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.760]   as far as I know.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.000]   Yeah, I think I got my hand on this.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.720]   But hold me out, saying she's only
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.000]   going to get the pure, blessed Android tablet.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.320]   Yeah, I have been saying that.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.880]   And I'm jones and for a tablet, I have to say.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.400]   And so to me, it was like, I had two or the first--
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.600]   Oh, I've had two?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.520]   Yeah, I'd be interested in checking out iPad 2.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.920]   So yeah, the Zoom is tempting.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   I might do it.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.360]   I might do it.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.400]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.680]   You're going to jailbreak iPad 2
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.800]   and try to run Android on it?
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.640]   Or you're just going to buy an iPad 2?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.000]   I want a tablet.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.080]   I want a good tablet, right?
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.800]   So an iPad 2 might be it, right?
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.600]   But yeah, no, the Zoom, I also want an Android tablet.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.680]   So $800?
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   That's a lot.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.160]   It's a lot.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.360]   I haven't decided yet, but very, very possible.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.000]   I registered for Google I/O in the hopes
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.600]   that there would be a tablet giveaway.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.760]   I don't know, maybe that's a good question.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.400]   Nice.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.040]   I was hoping for that in Davos this year.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.120]   Nothing.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.920]   I wonder, Murdoch, when they did the announcement of the Daily,
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.400]   they said at the end, there are tablets outside
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.880]   preloaded with the Daily.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.840]   And I asked in Twitter whether they were given away.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.320]   I've never heard an answer.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.920]   I-- there's a note here that says Google's saying,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.680]   no free loaners.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.480]   No.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.560]   I'm now in the free business.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.120]   I asked for a loaner from Google for the complete Android
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.560]   guide.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.880]   And I got a no dice.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.280]   You'd have to ask Motorola for that.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.920]   So I'm interested because that breaks from what
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.120]   I've previously experienced with asking Google for loaners.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.680]   I don't think the Zoom's coming out.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   I'm sticking to that.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.080]   Like the fact--
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.720]   $800, you have to decide whether you're paying a $300
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.200]   I love Android tax.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.080]   I mean, that's pretty--
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.680]   Now it's a good point.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.240]   It's a good point.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.320]   And everyone knows that I am cheap.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.280]   So I don't know.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:24.800]   I don't know.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.360]   It's very, very tempting, though.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.920]   They never let anyone actually use it at CES.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.640]   They only let that video play.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.440]   And they let someone--
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.640]   Sorry.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.160]   They let someone use it at the Honeycomb announcement.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.960]   When I asked for a loaner, they said, well,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.480]   you could have come out and played with it
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.560]   at the Android 3.0 event.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.280]   Even at that Android 3.0 event, even
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.800]   on the staged demonstration, the video call with CELO
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.360]   was really rough.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   And--
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.860]   Yes.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.300]   And they still haven't confirmed--
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.020]   if it was going to launch February 24,
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.340]   I feel like we'd know by now, because they ran a freaking
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.300]   Super Bowl ad for it.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Right.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.900]   And this leaked ad from Best Boy--
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.660]   Best Buy.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.660]   Best Boy.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.020]   I'm trying to hide their identity.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.140]   We don't know what company it could be somewhat
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.660]   like Best Boy.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.660]   Agreeable purchase has announced
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.980]   that they're going to have a Motorola Zoom.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.220]   Or Radio Shark.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.180]   No, this ad also says that Wi-Fi will not work until you activate
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.180]   a data plan.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.140]   And that's really sleazy.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.700]   Like, really?
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.620]   I had to.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.420]   Apple even managed to make AT&T go months to months of the iPad.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.860]   And we couldn't make Motorola agree to not even make you
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.660]   activate a data plan each.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.940]   They activate for at least one month.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.500]   But it makes you assume you can do one month and then cancel it.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.540]   But that's the throw in the month with the deal where you're
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.340]   charging that much money.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.180]   Right.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.500]   I mean, you should never just disable Wi-Fi,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.380]   because somebody didn't pay.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.500]   That's all a point of Wi-Fi.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   That's evil.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.340]   It actually takes-- well, I guess--
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.340]   I was going to say it takes the burden off your network
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.540]   to encourage people to use Wi-Fi.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.100]   But if you haven't activated a plan,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.780]   that doesn't take any burden off your network.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.380]   So I guess I don't care about that.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.820]   Yeah, the e-velometer is definitely up in the 10 and 11
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.340]   I have this one.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.700]   Vapor hardware.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.180]   Telling you, there's going to be a big announcement.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.740]   Motorola will say, hey, we've run into production problems.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.020]   It's delayed.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.740]   Are you serious?
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.460]   I made this prediction after CES,
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.940]   and now I have to stick with it.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.100]   Give it the odds.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.980]   Odds of seeing the Motorola Zoom by the end of this month,
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.900]   I will say there is a 27% chance.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.620]   Then we'll see it.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.900]   That we'll see it.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.420]   Oh.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.700]   This-- that's in the flow.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.220]   It is a short month, though.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.660]   That's true.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   I'll go all the way to the end of March
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.260]   and only raise it to like 36%.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.860]   Geez.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:06.380]   Are there any others at CES that are working behind Android--
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.540]   appropriate Android tablets that might leapfrog Zoom here?
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.140]   Well, we got the LG tablet.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.860]   Haven't heard much more about that one either, though.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.060]   Dell was rumored to be working on an Android 3.0 tablet.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.780]   They did say--
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.540]   Well, as it supposedly says that as soon as the OS is ready,
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.700]   they're going to be shipping stuff.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.540]   They showed off their Windows tablet yesterday,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.740]   and they said they will have an Android version as well
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.620]   later this year.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.140]   But that's also still later this year.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.180]   Galaxy Tab 2 haven't heard anything detailed on that.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.220]   There really aren't any Android tablets
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.940]   besides the Galaxy Tab that is already on sale that
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.660]   have solid info behind the monitor.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.260]   Hmm.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.780]   I think they're all a lie.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.620]   I don't really think that.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.900]   It's all just two computers.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.780]   Do you know what you consider the thing that it
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.020]   tabbed formerly known as BOM?
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.980]   The webOS tablet?
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.660]   The VR?
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.260]   No.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.260]   No.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.940]   No.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.980]   That was quick.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.500]   Not at all.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.580]   Just not enough usage and not enough interest for me.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.780]   And also, I'm not--
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.660]   I'm developing for Android now, so I'm kind of
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.140]   going to buy the platform that I want to develop on,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.620]   which is part of the reason why I want to get the iPad is
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.660]   that I'm working on an iOS app right now.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.220]   I don't even have an iOS device, so it makes sense
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.780]   to add one to the arsenal.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.980]   But now, the webOS isn't that interesting to me.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.580]   Although, like I said, there's one in my household.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.340]   It was a company-issued deal.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.860]   And it's pretty and it's nice and it feels good,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.180]   but it wasn't a consumer choice.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.900]   It was like, this is what my IT department supports.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.660]   Don't you love that phrase?
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.980]   Yeah, I used to hate that phrase.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.940]   That's why I like working here.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.900]   IT support-- doesn't support anything.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.900]   I just do it myself.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:52.900]   Right.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   You had everything.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900]   Pretty as whatever.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.860]   You do it all yourself.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.220]   All right, you mentioned Google I/O, Gina.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.820]   And tickets sold out in less than an hour.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.980]   Kind of sort of.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.020]   Kind of sort of.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.860]   They didn't leave.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.540]   Well, Gina can explain it a little better.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.820]   Yeah, I mean, so I got an email from Google last week
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.180]   that said, hey, you've been to Google I/O before,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.980]   so we're going to give you a chance to preregister
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.220]   for the event, which I did.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.180]   And so they basically gave everyone
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.500]   the opportunity who went to the 2010 event
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.860]   to preregister for 2011.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.700]   So then they opened up to the public on Monday morning,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.660]   and then the rest of the tickets sold out in under an hour.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.140]   So I mean, my read on this is like the 2010 event,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.900]   not only was it a great event, but you got two phones.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.380]   You got a droid and the EVO before the EVO
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.780]   had even been released.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.540]   I mean, I was talking to a student
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.940]   who went who got the student discount.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.540]   So his ticket was a couple hundred bucks.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.380]   He was basically like, my ticket is more than, you know,
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.900]   cost less than the cost of both of these phones, basically.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.740]   So the giveaways were great.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.580]   The event was great.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.540]   And so I think that a lot of people from the 2010, you know,
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.540]   2010 Google, I reregistered for 2011.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.860]   So I imagine that they filled a lot of seats, you know,
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.260]   in that preregistration period.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.020]   So I think it's great that they sold out in under an hour.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.700]   And it's a lot sooner than the earlier, the 2010 and 2009.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.700]   But it wasn't really quite just an hour, you know,
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.020]   that they filled up every seat.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.100]   May 10th and 11th in Moscone Center.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.340]   If you're wondering when it's going to be,
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.180]   Gina, you're going to be there.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.460]   Jeff, you're going to be there?
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.980]   - No, I'm going to be in the East Coast teaching.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.060]   - Okay.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.580]   - We will miss you.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.100]   - I know, I have to be much fun going on there.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.220]   - Maybe you can talk to Gina
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.060]   into giving you some of her stuff.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.980]   - I'll be there.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.660]   - Maybe I'll turn my question to the thing is,
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.140]   if I came out, I'd stand there, like,
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.940]   I'm speaking tomorrow at a conference in Amsterdam,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.940]   a media conference, and I'm the only guy speaking English.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.940]   That's the way I'd feel at Google I/O.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.200]   (laughing)
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.500]   - Those speaking situations are always bad.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.540]   I spoke in Amsterdam once,
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.780]   and I was the only person speaking English.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.780]   It made me really nervous during the introduction
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.500]   and Dutch that I couldn't understand.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.340]   So what are these things about?
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.380]   - I mean, I'd be grabbing on a good,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.820]   to Gina saying, what are they saying now?
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.460]   What does that mean?
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.500]   Translate that for me.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.940]   - And then they'll all turn against you.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.420]   And you'll notice that you are not one of them.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.100]   They drive you from their midst.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.860]   - Leo and I are gonna do some live coverage somehow.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.340]   - The bloodstream.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.900]   - But Kevin, you mentioned you're gonna be there as well.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.740]   That's cool.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.460]   - Yeah, Gina, do you think that people,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.620]   do you think that most independent developers
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.020]   sign up for this thinking like, yay free phones?
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.260]   - I mean, I didn't last year, but be honest,
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.020]   after last year, this year I did.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.100]   I was like, oh, you know,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.780]   there's probably gonna be a pretty good giveaway.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.940]   I think it's independent,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.460]   I think it developers sign up for it
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.660]   and they get it, they expense it as part of,
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.940]   you know, their kind of company development efforts.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.260]   I think there are a lot of development efforts is going on.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.380]   - If you had to justify it to say your boss,
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.420]   like Nick Denton, how would you do so?
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.700]   - I'd say, hey, you know how we keep getting complaints
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.140]   about how stuff doesn't work on Android
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.140]   'cause we don't have any Android devices around the office?
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   Like send me to this thing
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.860]   and I will come home with Android devices
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.020]   so we can test the website on.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.420]   - Snap.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.260]   That works.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.420]   (laughing)
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.900]   - And you can record it and say,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.340]   - Catch Google executives in affairs.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.180]   That's the way you get this.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.300]   - Exactly.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.140]   - Don't do it.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.220]   - The founder of Life Hacker even agrees with me
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.020]   and play that bit.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.940]   - Indeed.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.500]   - There you go.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.540]   - All right, new numbers out for search engines.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.500]   These come out rather regularly
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.980]   but usually I'm not very excited about them
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.940]   because it's usually Google either goes up or down 1%,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.620]   Bing goes up 1%, Yahoo goes down 1%,
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.100]   but they're a little more dramatic this time.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.460]   Google only dropped 2% but they did drop
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.420]   between December and January.
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.940]   They're now breaking it out as Bing powered search
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.180]   and Bing.com to include Yahoo
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.500]   as part of the entire Bing ecosystem I guess.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.540]   So Bing powered search went up 6%.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.300]   Bing.com itself actually went up 21%
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.140]   from 10.6% of the market to 12.81%
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.900]   and Yahoo search went down 4%.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.740]   - That's an alarm.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.260]   What's the anomaly there?
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.660]   - It's gotta be a typo.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.220]   Like they went from a 10.6% share in December 2010
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.220]   to a 12.81% share in January 2011.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.060]   That's not 21% is it?
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.740]   - Well, yeah, 10% when you start small.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.500]   - Oh, it's a percentage of the change
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.380]   like the 2.8.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.220]   Yeah, okay.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.540]   But still usually Bing only goes up, you know,
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   less than 1%.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.180]   They went up, oh, just around 2%,
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.340]   just a little over 2% points I should say.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.660]   - It's all that Google was the other one.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.460]   It's all that Google results feelin' they're doin'.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.300]   - That's all the copy.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.380]   - It's the only results.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.900]   - I really don't think that,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.540]   I think that thing was so overblown.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.660]   And I definitely don't think,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.140]   I don't know if you guys know this,
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.980]   but I am in week three of a month of using Bing
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.820]   as an alternative to Google.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.660]   - Really?
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.500]   - Wow.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.340]   - Tell us about that.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.140]   - It is now my default search on all my browsers.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.460]   I will still, I still allow myself to use Google
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.740]   if I need to, but when I go to my default search,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   it uses Bing, I would say 90% of the time,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.420]   I don't even notice the difference.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.340]   I'm looking for something that comes up,
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.300]   you know, I'm able to find it.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.940]   Where I do notice the difference in a big way
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.180]   are in video and news searches.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.900]   In video, it's a positive for Bing.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.620]   So when I'm looking for a particular video,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   I actually find it in Bing,
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.500]   almost never find videos in Google.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.300]   I have to like trick it into giving me the page
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.020]   that I want, like, you know,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.300]   trying to find the actual page,
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.140]   or I just go straight to a source like YouTube,
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.620]   which is Google.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.140]   In Bing, I'm able to find videos really easily.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.100]   On the other side of it,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.700]   news is horrible in Bing.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.220]   If I know I read a news story
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.060]   and I actually have the headline
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.540]   and can paste the headline in,
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.220]   I still can't find it on Bing.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.940]   - News is hard, that's why we should all use day life.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.620]   For instance, where I'm a partner,
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.980]   the news is why.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.580]   And to get the right sources
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.420]   and the right kind of,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.580]   it's a whole different kind of categorization.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.340]   You know, I have a really stupid chart
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.660]   that I show at media conferences,
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.420]   like the one tomorrow.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.980]   And I say that media used to be based,
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.700]   discovery of media was based on brands.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.540]   We went to the brands,
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.420]   and we had to buy them publication,
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   we had to go to the show.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.060]   And then search came along
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.780]   and changed that around, obviously,
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.100]   where we have to ask first.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.500]   But then to the side of that,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.660]   I put a nodule, which is algorithmic,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.180]   in that Google wasn't good at live.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.500]   Only Google News made them be good at live.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.460]   Algorithms are crappy at live and current.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.180]   Algorithms need content to ferment like wine
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.580]   before they know anything about it.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   And then the next circle up, by the way,
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.380]   obviously is human links, which is Twitter
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.980]   and Facebook and such.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.340]   But yeah, the algorithmic piece,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.580]   the ability to understand the language
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.780]   and understand the currency and the sources
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.180]   and cluster it together is, as they say, not trivial.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.460]   - I think you degraded I/O, Jeff, not trivial.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.460]   - They just say that again.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.940]   Ah, that's not trivial.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.100]   - That's not trivial.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.740]   - I need the I/O glossary
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.100]   for how to fake your way through.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.220]   That'd be a good story.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.300]   - Well, maybe you could use Google Translate.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   (laughing)
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   - I would do, we need to come up with
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.900]   common developer phrases.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.020]   I think that's not trivial as a very common,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.260]   that's my coded way of being like,
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.900]   yeah, that's not gonna happen for a while.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.300]   (laughing)
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.420]   When I'm talking about my own apps.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.300]   I don't have the link right now,
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.300]   but somebody wrote a great post that I tweeted yesterday
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.180]   for how to write a polemic book.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.900]   And the funny thing is, my two books follow the rules
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.740]   with G.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.580]   (laughing)
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.780]   One word, then at the end of the paragraph,
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.180]   you use that word, say it all comes back to this.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.340]   And then after the book's out,
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.660]   you come back and reinterpret any event
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.620]   in the world the same well.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.140]   It's of course, it's part of the same trend.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.860]   So, last time it was, it was Google understanding the world.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.580]   But for me, this time it's publicness.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.580]   So yeah, I think we can do a whole language sort for Google I/O.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.020]   I'd like that.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.860]   - We should do that.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.420]   I'm gonna start writing down our developer phrases
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.820]   as I use them and hear them.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.020]   - I would love to see a phrase cloud generated
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.180]   out of these docs.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.780]   (laughing)
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.620]   - It's a good idea.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.900]   - Well, give that phrase cloud chipotle is hot pie too.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.580]   (laughing)
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.180]   - Yeah, burritos, crush, glee, that was awesome.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.900]   - I don't think Blaine will be there though, right Gina?
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.260]   - Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.540]   - I don't think too many developers are talking about Glee.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.180]   - You can predict the next Malcolm Gladwell book
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.820]   by just looking at that cloud.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.660]   - That's right.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.500]   - There you go.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.340]   - You can have an auto-written--
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.260]   - You can use the new Gladwell book generator.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.540]   - Indeed.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.100]   - It's great.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.420]   - There's a website, I wish we had the link for it,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.180]   but it generates a Malcolm Gladwell book,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.980]   like automatically just hit refresh
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.980]   and there's another Malcolm Gladwell book.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.700]   - Well, getting back to these Google numbers really quick.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.140]   I mean, these search numbers from Experian.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.540]   - Are they significant?
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.900]   Jeff, I mean, is it finally worth looking at them?
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.740]   'Cause usually I just wanna ignore them every month
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.900]   'cause it doesn't seem like anything really too huge.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.180]   - I don't think necessarily,
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.700]   I think it could flip up.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.420]   I think what Jeff do is look at a longer-term trend
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:14.420]   and Google last, I don't know what the current market share is
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.820]   but they've been running around what 67% the US market share.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.660]   - Yeah.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.860]   - And here in Europe, in Germany,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.780]   where the Germans complain about Google constantly,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.780]   that was a bad accent, it runs about 98%, 97, 98%,
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.100]   showing that media and government are quite out of sync.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.180]   So Google already is not in a search
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.300]   and has not been in a search monopoly position
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.780]   in the US for quite some time.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:47.780]   What's the next breakpoint where it matters to Google?
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.860]   - Well, you could say 50%, yeah, sure.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.660]   It's gonna take a big a long time to get there.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.380]   Second, it's not really a search industry,
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.380]   it's an ad industry in Google's way ahead there
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.060]   and does have much higher market penetration.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.220]   They're way more than the Microsoft has.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.780]   So, from a business perspective,
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.220]   there's a lot of ego invested in those numbers
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.020]   but I don't think there's a lot of business reality yet.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.700]   Check me in a year, I can be wrong.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.060]   But yet, Google acts like they're under severe attack
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.980]   with this whole gotcha, we caught Bing
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.500]   with seven to nine results out of 100 being copied.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.900]   - So, Tom, part of that I think is that Google,
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.300]   you listen to Google in this narration talking
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.660]   not about Facebook as a competitor
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.340]   but Microsoft as a competitor.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.020]   You now see this Bing stuff.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.700]   It is in Google's interest to seem
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.420]   as if they have harky competitors, plenty.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.380]   - That's a good question.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.100]   - A competitor, Facebook as competitor,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.940]   Microsoft competitor, monopoly, schmannopoly.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.100]   - Look, we have people trying to copy our results.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.900]   We must have competitors.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.820]   - Right.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.260]   - They're also extra sensitive about spam results.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.620]   People have made a big deal about that
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.460]   for a couple of months now.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.500]   We talked about it on Twitter,
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.380]   you guys have talked about it on Twitter quite a bit.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.780]   MacCuts has a blog post up today
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.780]   comparing Google in 2000 to Google in 2011,
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.140]   really trying to show you that the results
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.220]   have improved.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.980]   They're still fighting this fun
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.140]   that Google's results are getting worse.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.700]   - Yeah, I mean, Matt isn't a PR person though.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.500]   Matt is the lead engineer and the spam team.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.300]   I think that Matt's a good guy
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.740]   and I think that he takes a lot of pride
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.260]   in the general perception about Google search results,
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.420]   especially spam results.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.020]   So it makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.140]   Actually, I think this is great that he did this post.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.700]   I think people tend to, when things are good,
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.780]   when they initially launch,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.420]   I think later people tend to say,
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.420]   well, that kind of sucks now.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.500]   It's jumped the shark when in reality,
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.540]   things have gotten better.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.900]   And I think that was Matt's point here.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.700]   - Danny Sullivan in the very first comment on Matt's post says,
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.460]   last year you effectively dropped host crowding
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.220]   by putting up more results from a website
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.420]   for some searches rather than fewer.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.060]   You know, this is an issue that drives me insane.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.300]   One result for site subdomain, you name it.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.140]   That's all I need,
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.500]   especially with the use of site links.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.580]   I simply don't understand why Google can't give me
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.500]   more variety in my results.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.060]   - Well, Kudos to Danny for having this conversation.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.100]   - First post too.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.460]   First page I just tried first.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.660]   - Just a good journalist.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.380]   - Yeah, he resisted the urge to just write first.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:36.260]   All right, let's take a quick break and thank Squarespace,
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.940]   the fast and easy way to publish a high quality or website
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.460]   or blog, I use Squarespace for a couple of different podcasts
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.940]   that I do, forecast right here on Twitch.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.500]   I use a Squarespace blog for that to keep track of everything,
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.700]   let people know when we have new episodes up,
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.500]   give people a chance to comment.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.580]   It's really easy to use.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.020]   You can make a good looking site.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.340]   I have no design sense whatsoever.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.060]   And Squarespace is a savior in that respect.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.860]   You can pick from hundreds of templates.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.900]   They have, I think they have thousands almost,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.580]   hundreds of design templates to choose from.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.460]   You can customize any design to fit your needs.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.740]   It's easy to customize things like colors
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.060]   and move blocks around.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.700]   But if you do know CSS or even want to learn a little bit
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.220]   about it, you can get underneath and customize it even more.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.180]   The service includes modules to build your website,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.820]   widgets like Flickr photo display, you can add Google Maps,
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.540]   you can have multiple people working on the site,
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.220]   doesn't cost anything extra.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.540]   They also adapt the bandwidth to your popularity.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.300]   You're just paying your one fee
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.820]   and they make sure that there was enough bandwidth there
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.740]   for your blog to be visited.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.340]   So why don't you go check them out?
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.580]   You can actually import your old site.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.100]   If you want to see how your site looks in Squarespace,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.340]   take the site you've got now.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.420]   It doesn't matter what it is,
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   type pad, movable type, blogger, WordPress,
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.540]   import it into Squarespace and try it out for free.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.340]   We're giving away a 14 day free trial
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.740]   to sign up for a free account.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.580]   No credit card needed.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.700]   Just try it out to build out your website.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.700]   Go to squarespace.com/twig@squarespace.com/twig.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.620]   Why don't I give it a shot?
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.180]   Either import your site and see what it looks like
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.300]   or just create something from scratch, play around with it.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   You got 14 days and see what you can come up with.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.180]   I think you're gonna like it.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.340]   squarespace.com/twig, we thank them for their support
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.540]   of this week in Google.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.780]   So on a rather serious note,
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.500]   I'm not sure exactly how to pronounce his name.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.740]   Is it whale, goanam?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   Does anybody know?
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.380]   - I think they're saying the video goanim.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.820]   - Goanim. - It's a whale goanim.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.660]   - Whale goanim.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.300]   He is a marketing director for Google in the Middle East.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.580]   He disappeared during the protests last week
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.700]   and earlier this week was released from prison.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.620]   He made a remark about how he had fooled his employer
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.740]   in order to go to the protest.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.700]   I found this very interesting
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   that a marketing director at a big firm like Google
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.940]   would also be a leader of the protest movement.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.860]   He was one of the administrators for the Facebook pages
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.740]   that were used to organize people.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.660]   - Which is also kind of neat too,
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:23.820]   that the tool he used was Facebook, but that's okay.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.340]   That's only a smart online person
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.620]   recognizes the appropriate tools used.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.660]   He wasn't using social tools and that's okay.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   I think we're incredibly courageous men.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.500]   I don't know if he knew what he'd say himself into
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.340]   when he did it, but the fact that he did.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.900]   And also the story that I'm dying to hear
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.340]   is what did happen to get him out,
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.180]   how the protesters made him kind of their unofficial
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.300]   those silent spokesperson to keep the spotlight on him,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.980]   was Google bringing anything to bear?
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.700]   These are things we don't know yet,
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.340]   but thank God he's out.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.100]   - Yeah, thank goodness he is out.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.780]   I mean, what a leader and from a purely kind of,
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.340]   from a company perspective, I think that he's incredible.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.180]   I think he was representing Google really well.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.700]   This was kind of like the internet,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.220]   he's calling it the internet revolution.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.140]   This revolution happened because of activity on the internet.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.500]   And that word was spread through social media.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.620]   He used Facebook, he used Twitter,
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.020]   but Google's been known to use Twitter,
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.940]   maybe not Facebook, but at least Twitter
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.380]   to organize actions.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.260]   So I think it's incredible.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.540]   I think he's been really articulate.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.220]   And when he first went missing,
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.860]   Kristobona had tweeted that he was missing
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.340]   and I'd just been thinking about him,
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.660]   worried about him for so long.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.020]   I'm so glad that he's freed and okay.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.740]   And what an incredible leader.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.020]   I would love to know what his conversations
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.700]   with his managers are like at Google.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.060]   What Google had to do with this, if anything?
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.300]   I don't know if we'll ever know.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   - Yeah, he was in prison for 12 days.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.740]   - You're like blindfolded and solitary, right?
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.620]   - Yeah, the journalists who've been in prison
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.780]   have talked about hearing horrendous torture
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.900]   in prison and other things.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.060]   It's wildly unpleasant and difficult to imagine.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.180]   And when journalists are also kidnapped
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.420]   or taken prisoner, oftentimes
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.140]   journalists organizations manage to keep their quiet.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.300]   I suspect in this case, the publicness of it
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:18.620]   was part of what helped to get him safely out.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.660]   - Yeah, we're just really glad that he is out.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.780]   He says, quote, "I'm not a hero,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.180]   "but those who are martyred are the heroes."
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.140]   He's broken to a chant of Mubarak, "Leave, leave."
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.020]   So he's not done as are most of the protesters in Egypt.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.460]   Not done with this yet.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.180]   - Let's move on to some Android news.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.420]   We talked a little bit about the Zoom earlier.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.220]   Gartner had some more numbers out.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.220]   Good news for Android OS sales grew 888% in 2010.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.140]   That's almost a useless number, isn't it?
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.340]   - 880%.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.340]   - That one's happy about that number.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.060]   - Well, yeah, I mean, with the Verizon iPhone coming out,
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.940]   a lot of people have been kind of, you know,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.420]   friends and relatives have been kind of like,
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.140]   "Ooh, what do you think about Android now?"
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.860]   And, you know, it's funny to think that like,
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.420]   you know, that it's still growing pretty big
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.700]   and it would take a large number of manufacturers,
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.620]   you know, turning their back and walking away
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.340]   to make Android just instantly disappear overnight.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.900]   But 888% is nothing to sneeze at,
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.100]   even if it is a kind of fake number almost.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:39.260]   - Gartner and ComScore both put out numbers this week.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.620]   And iOS depends on who you're reading.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.900]   Seems to be doing great, you know,
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.540]   not losing that much market share
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.060]   or gaining a little versus, you know,
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.580]   Android is obviously the big winner.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.140]   And there's no doubt that they're taking it from RIM.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.140]   - Right.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.180]   - What is the use case for having a BlackBerry now?
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.620]   Seriously guys, like what is it just hardware keyboard?
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.340]   - Or is it your company?
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.180]   Or is it your company?
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.020]   Yeah, being Canadian.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.340]   - Canadian pride, is that what you're saying, Jeff?
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.300]   - Yeah.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.020]   - Or your company just forces it on you.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.380]   What does BlackBerry have to really recommend itself these days?
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.220]   - Nobody?
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   - I'll take a stab.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.580]   - The BlackBerry Enterprise Server is loved by many
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.140]   who want to manage permissions on IT network
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.060]   or have good security and not worry
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.980]   that somebody's going to break into the phone system somehow.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.940]   So I think that's legit.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.580]   I've also heard a lot of, I've heard some developers say
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.260]   that they prefer Blackberries
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.820]   because they prefer the keyboards
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.820]   on the BlackBerry devices.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.340]   And they've got to do some terminal coding
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.380]   or whatever on their phone sometime.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.740]   - Encryption and that kind of thing too.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.380]   And generally, if your corporate overlords
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.580]   have a BlackBerry server set up,
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.060]   they're going to want to stick with that.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.500]   But every time these results come out,
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.860]   it's always Windows, Media and BlackBerry that lose out.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.460]   - But go back to earlier in the show.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.460]   It makes you wonder where the WO-S
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.460]   has whether the investment is at all worth it.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.020]   - If they have a shot in hell.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.100]   (laughs)
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.300]   - Good question.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.100]   - And certainly speaks to,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.100]   that's the great thing about the Nokia story.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.180]   Nokia owned the world and on the Bernie platform,
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.740]   they used to eOeL that,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   and then said, how long has the iOS been out?
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.900]   How long has Android been out?
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.380]   Where are we?
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.180]   And it's lost.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.580]   - Nokia's share of the smartphone market
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:43.080]   dropped 6.7% from 2009 to 2010.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.500]   - Two one.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.460]   - They went end users,
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.980]   phone sales to end users reached 461.3 million units.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.780]   A 7.5% drop.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.860]   That's for their entire phone sales.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.340]   And then smartphones dropped 6.7%.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.540]   I don't have the total number there though.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.900]   - And smartphone is always, of course,
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.820]   a kind of fluid definition of a phone that runs apps
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.220]   or something like that, but still.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   - But the super smartphone, now that we know what it is.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.060]   - Right.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.140]   - A super phone.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.900]   - Yeah, I mean, it's easy to pick on WebOS
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.260]   because they're the underdog.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.420]   They're very small numbers.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.780]   How could they possibly make an in-road?
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.380]   But a lot of people made those arguments about Apple
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.260]   when they first came into the phone market.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.220]   Not everyone, but a lot of people said,
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.060]   well, what is Apple?
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.900]   No, how are they gonna break in
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.300]   against the dominance of Symbian and Blackberry
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.540]   and Windows Mobile?
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.340]   And that market has turned on its head.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.540]   So I guess what you're saying, Jeff, to me,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.980]   it sounds like it's hard to identify what that advantage is.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.620]   WebOS is a fine operating system.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.420]   Conceivably, it works great,
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.700]   but what makes you choose it?
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.900]   - Over a few minutes. - Over a few minutes.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.500]   - Yeah, no, that's a really good point.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.060]   BOS is probably still one of the best operating systems
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.660]   I've ever used, but nobody used it.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.020]   - Right, so I mean to go back to that discussion,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.460]   but that's what this is fascinating to me
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.180]   is that the momentum seems so strong,
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.060]   the cost of entry or re-entry into this
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.340]   is now so spectacularly high.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.980]   How do you compete with free?
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:25.940]   How do you compete with a network of manufacturers?
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.940]   It just seems like if you're RIM and Nokia and HP,
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:36.460]   - I think it depends on deep pockets
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.820]   and being able to get developers involved.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.500]   Apple has managed to be able to get developers involved
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.300]   because the demographics of the iPhone
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.500]   are such that people like to buy apps on it.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.700]   They already had iTunes set up
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.300]   and people who own iPhones really
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.700]   and don't mind paying $1.99 for an app.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.940]   Android is backed by a company with huge pockets,
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.740]   huge, huge, huge pockets.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.500]   That could, whether or not they make money
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.460]   on the system itself is almost like a secondary mission
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.420]   to getting people on the web and searching through Google.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.980]   If RIM or HP had a long enough game plan,
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.020]   long-term enough game plan,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.780]   I think that they could somehow entice developers
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.980]   but it's the third party developers in a large way
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.780]   that you have to get excited about.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.620]   - So you're right, you're right.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.940]   Really critical point is that the OS in mobile
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.700]   is not the end game whatsoever.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.780]   It's obviously just a tool on the way
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.580]   for the case of Apple, it's to sell hardware
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.580]   for the case of Google.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.180]   It's more signals to enable more relevance
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.260]   in search content and advertising.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.940]   And it's a fight that Google needs to fight
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.460]   to fight Facebook, which is a better signal generator,
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.540]   I like that phrase, for our lives.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.300]   Then, and so you're right, it's not about the OS at all.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.300]   It's about the how it feeds the Uber business strategy
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.460]   and neither RIM nor certainly HP really necessarily has that.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.780]   Although to say that Apple does make money on iPhones,
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.020]   much if you look at that, Apple makes tons of money
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.420]   on iPhones as opposed to most other manufacturers.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.500]   - I would agree though, so say it is,
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.860]   hardware is the real business model for Apple
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.780]   and sales and other products, so that works.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:26.180]   They have enough justification that they will invest
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.740]   in that OS because it pays off in other ways.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.580]   - Sure.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.980]   - And for consumers, people bought the iPhone
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.260]   because they didn't want to carry on a phone
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.620]   in their iPod anymore.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.820]   I mean, Apple had millions of iPods out
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.020]   in the market to begin with, so it made sense for people.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.700]   And then with Google, it was like,
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.420]   I want a phone that's going to give me the web
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.020]   without a gatekeeper, full web access,
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.460]   being able to search easily.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.420]   What is the compelling, from a consumer perspective,
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.420]   what's the compelling reason to buy another phone
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.660]   at this point?
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.500]   - Really would have to be cheap or amazing battery life
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.820]   or they'd have to instantly come up with great apps
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.180]   that everybody wanted.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.260]   The better than Angry Birds Angry Birds,
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.100]   which would be pretty hard at this point.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:08.940]   - Yeah.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.500]   - What could possibly be better than Angry Birds, Kevin?
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.060]   - I don't know.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.660]   - Happy Birds, agitated moles.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.660]   (laughing)
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.980]   - Did you guys see?
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.100]   - Did you guys see the guy that dressed up as kids
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.900]   as the Angry Birds and then took a photograph?
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.820]   I think it's on laughing squid, it's very, very cute.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.460]   - No, but I saw Funny or Die did a real life Angry Birds
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.580]   where they built a catapult.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.420]   - Oh, nice.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.140]   - And actually, and it had like big red rubber balls
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.020]   with the bird faces painted on them
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.660]   and then set up the stuff, right?
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.020]   The wood pieces and everything
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.540]   and put little pigs in there.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.380]   - Sweet.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.420]   - The thing is they actually were able to knock it
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.900]   entirely down every time.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.020]   Those structures are way less stable in real life
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.660]   than they are in the game.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.020]   - I think that debating the physics of Angry Birds
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.700]   definitely goes into the coders like, you know,
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.100]   phrase, phrase book.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.940]   (laughing)
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.780]   For sure.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.620]   - Window.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.460]   - Right.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.340]   - Windows Phone 7, which is a really good phone.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.980]   If you just, if you lived in a soundproof bubble
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.660]   and had never read any news in the last five years,
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.980]   Windows Phone 7 is a really easy phone to use.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.460]   My wife has one and it's pretty nice.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.300]   It's really big buttons and really big widgets,
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.820]   live updates, very nice.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.620]   But even Microsoft with all the cache that they have
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.900]   was not able to get everyone they wanted as a launch partner.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.600]   They weren't able to get, I believe, I'm sorry.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.320]   They were not able to get Pandora on board right away,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.980]   which is kind of a big deal these days.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.780]   I mean, that's almost like a gold standard for smartphones.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.460]   And there are all these new gold standards that exist
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.420]   every time a new phone or a new mobile device comes along.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.720]   You have to have Netflix.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.880]   You have to have Pandora.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.100]   You have to have, you know, really good Twitter
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.060]   and Facebook apps.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.400]   And it's a pretty big, you know, fence to get over.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.060]   If you're gonna come out with a brand new thing,
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.780]   HP and Palm and RIM would have to have really good apps
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.060]   in all those categories just to even like,
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.880]   you know, garner the tech press's attention.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.600]   - That's where something like Alien Dalvik by Miri
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.080]   it becomes really interesting.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.880]   I'm not sure how well this is going to work,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.080]   but apparently a mobile world Congress in Barcelona,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.720]   they're going to announce Alien Dalvik
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.560]   as a piece of software that will allow Android applications
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.220]   to run on non-Android phones.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.460]   Is this as wonderful as it sounds?
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.680]   - I read a little bit about it today.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.340]   It sounded pretty interesting, but it seems more like
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.520]   an unofficial hack really than something that, you know,
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.740]   that, you know, MassMart merchants would wanna have Android
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.540]   running on their devices unofficially or, you know.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.980]   - Yeah, it's essentially like virtualization.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.540]   So the same way you'd run, say, you know,
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.900]   Internet Explorer on a Mac by virtualizing it in parallels
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:57.220]   or VMware, this Alien Dalvik and Miri it is a virtualization
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.080]   company would run, say, on MIGO
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.880]   and be able to run all Android apps on MIGO.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.900]   - It depends entirely on how well this works
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.760]   and my initial reaction is like,
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.000]   I wouldn't wanna do this because it would probably
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.560]   be slow and weird, but that's just sort of my experience
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.000]   with virtualization in general.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.600]   I mean, I think, you know, Android likes its memory
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.660]   and processor and I just think putting that,
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.200]   Dalvik is the job of runtime that Android runs its,
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   you know, all Android, Android's operating system
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.280]   and apps are all Java, Dalvik is the runtime.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.520]   So this Alien Dalvik is just, we're putting that runtime
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.660]   on top of these other phones.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.560]   Yeah, I don't know, this seems like kind of a niche side
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.120]   project for like super nerds.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.240]   I don't know that this is gonna be a consumer thing,
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.160]   but I could be wrong.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.440]   - Would you want it to work as a developer?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.320]   Would you want your Android apps to be on every operating
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.400]   system and conceivably run everywhere?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.840]   - In theory, but in practice as a developer,
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.120]   I want the app to work quickly and smoothly
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.840]   without any sort of hiccups or memory problems
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.680]   or force close dialogues.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.360]   And I don't know, it depends on how well this works.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.960]   It's hard for me to believe that this virtualization software
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.040]   that will work fast enough and well enough
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.160]   on, you know, non-Android phones to work well,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.960]   but I shouldn't say that until I try it.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.880]   But sure, I mean, as a developer, I want my app to be
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.320]   everywhere that it can be.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.680]   I hope that my app is good enough that someone would want
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.440]   to install virtualization software to run my app.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   That would be nice.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   I just don't know how realistic that is.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   - We've got some app news.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.320]   Google Translate was updated.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.440]   Now this was updated not just for Android,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.680]   but also hits the app store as well.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.760]   - For the iPhone, yes.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.840]   - Yeah, I'm sorry, when I said app store,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.200]   that was very vague.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.960]   I mean, it hits the iTunes app store.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.200]   It was previously available as a website.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.600]   It would just go as it can get the HTML5 version.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:06.200]   - Does Google, are they able to gain an advantage
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.840]   by doing this where they have something available
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.800]   in Android for a while and then roll it out to iOS?
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.720]   So they're like, "Hey, we're platform agnostic,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.560]   but you give a little edge to Android every time.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.640]   Does that build up?"
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.600]   - I really don't know anybody of my casual Android
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.720]   using friends who want to ask them why they got it droid.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.120]   They're like, "Ooh, Google goggles."
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.080]   'Cause that's why, 'cause that was an amazing,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.160]   I mean, a lot of Google's first run apps for Android
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.240]   are kind of Ounifte apps and they're not necessarily,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.480]   must have, except for Google navigation,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.520]   which I must say is, continues to be
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.360]   kind of a huge selling point for Android.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.840]   But I really, most of the apps that go Android exclusive
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.920]   at first are just kind of neat things.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.680]   I don't really see them doing the kind of power play
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.440]   like they did with the original droid
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.560]   and a driving navigation.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.080]   So I can't imagine, but I would love to see the numbers.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.040]   If they did pull in on why people look out their phone.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.280]   - I love the idea of Google Translate though.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.800]   Oh, Eugene?
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.600]   - Yeah, Google Translate is an awesome app.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.240]   I think it's great, it's on the iPhone.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.480]   I mean, I think it's interesting
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.000]   and I don't have numbers to back this up.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.040]   But my impression is that most third party
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.040]   first run mobile apps show up on the iPhone first, right?
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.320]   So iPhone users generally get third party apps first.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.920]   I think that Google releasing internal Google apps
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.560]   on Android first.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   I mean, certainly they want to attract attention
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.360]   to their own platform first.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.000]   There's also that pesky approval process
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.640]   that they have to wait for Apple,
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.880]   if they submit their app to Apple.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.280]   But I think there's also just this like,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.760]   hey, look, you can get cool Google technology
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.360]   on your Android phone.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.840]   And like, this is one of the things that you get
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.800]   when you get Android.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.120]   - Here's my brain fart of the day.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.080]   And I was gone because Swisscom
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.280]   the hotel room charges me a freaking fortune
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.400]   and eight hours in advance.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.840]   They cut me off anyway.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.000]   - But you digress.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.840]   - Yeah.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:01.480]   You almost, I started fantasizing about a single use product
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.640]   just for translate for travelers, right?
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.280]   It's the Star Trek device
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.200]   that as the flip camera proved the viability of light video.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.840]   And now we don't need it because we've got our phones
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.680]   and so on and so forth.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   But I almost wonder whether Android could power
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.440]   a very simple single use to buy a Slack got
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.760]   is to say Google.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.160]   The problem is you get connectivity,
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.960]   but if you did a deal with the connectivity
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.040]   was only gonna do occasional translations,
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.080]   it was really minor usage.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.600]   You almost wonder whether you could build a device like that.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.000]   I know it's kind of silly because how often you really use
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.320]   and how often you really travel.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.120]   If you need to talk to your servants
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.040]   and you don't speak their language,
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.680]   maybe use them more often.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.840]   But just in terms of thinking about how these OSs
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.320]   could be used in different ways to power different things.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.440]   - It's a wider question, isn't it?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.680]   Of in this world where we're getting multi-use devices
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.720]   in multiple form factors.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.200]   Which I remember reading about in Scientific American
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.800]   in the 90s and the MIT folks at the time were saying,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.680]   "This is the way it's gonna be.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.080]   "You're just gonna have a big device at home
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.840]   "that sits on a cabinet.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.720]   "Then you're gonna have a smaller one at your desktop
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   "and then you're gonna have a little or one
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.680]   "for moving around like a tablet.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.440]   "Then you're gonna have a block
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.000]   "and they're all gonna do everything."
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.160]   That's pretty much what we've got.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.320]   That's what's happening.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.160]   But the question is, is there still room
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.560]   for single purpose devices?
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.840]   What was the name of the Twitter peak came out?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.120]   Like everyone just mocked it.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.040]   Because all it did was show Twitter
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.760]   and it didn't even show all 140 characters in a line
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.280]   until you clicked through.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.920]   That's obviously the worst example of it.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.320]   But you bring up a really interesting example, Jeff,
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.120]   which is that's something practical.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.080]   If I'm sitting in Sky Mall on my plane
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.120]   and Hamaker Schlemmer sells a universal translator
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.200]   for $400 that I can buy and carry with me
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.000]   on my business trips and will translate everything
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.120]   everyone says in vice versa, that would sound attractive.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.240]   - Yeah, that's, I mean, probably it's not big enough
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.400]   for the vice, but it just, I think we're thinking too narrowly
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.040]   about the use of these OS's.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.800]   And the only thing I've seen that breaks out at all
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.680]   was the, I mentioned it three times now,
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.560]   the Android ski goggles, you know,
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.520]   see the map in your line of sight.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.360]   Okay, cool.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.080]   But I think that when you're connected,
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.640]   there are devices that are gonna work
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.840]   on a very simple level.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.240]   And the problem right now is the phone models
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.400]   don't support this.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.880]   But certainly the hardware could and the OS could.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   - But what? - And Android's the one to do it.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.680]   - I guess it would, would I choose
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   a single purpose device like that,
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.520]   whether it's the translator or not.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.960]   If I could also get that app and just have it on my phone
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.080]   and carry one less thing.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.160]   - Were you still by cameras?
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.940]   - I don't.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.200]   But yeah, lots of people do.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.760]   Now it's a good point.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.440]   - I've given up the idea that I'm gonna carry
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.080]   a separate camera, it's my camera phone.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.160]   But I'm not a photographer.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.240]   - Yeah, see that's it.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.600]   - That's the difference.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.040]   - No camera, sorry.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.880]   Next is one.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.360]   Works for me.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.400]   - Yeah, this, I guess you could call this the scoble problem.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.680]   - Which scoble problem are you referring to?
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.600]   - I think you're referring to a scoble problem.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.120]   - I was referring to.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.040]   - Scoble will always carry lots of cameras,
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.160]   but that's scoble.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   - Right, well, and maybe that's it, right?
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.240]   Which is we'll want these separate devices
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   when we're really enthusiastic about whatever it is they do.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.720]   And want the extra performance that can be squeezed out
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.120]   of the device being specialized and optimized for it,
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.400]   like a DSLR camera.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.040]   I don't think you'll ever see a phone
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:49.080]   that will also will work as a DSLR camera.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:54.080]   The form factors alone just don't compare.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.840]   So yeah, I think that's where something like Android
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.880]   does have a huge possibility to become an embedded operating.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.080]   What are the operating systems in DSLRs?
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.400]   - I know a lot of the point and shoots work
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.760]   on embedded Linux of various flavors.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.600]   - Really?
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.840]   - Which you can have.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.200]   - I can't.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.280]   I don't know.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.240]   Maybe that's a business model for somebody coming up
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.320]   with a really awesome third party firmware for cameras
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.160]   that lets you do crazy things like automatic tagging
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.600]   and geotagging and stuff like that.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.440]   - I don't know.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   - Trademark this group.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.120]   (laughs)
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:34.960]   - Indeed.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   - All right, AT&T is trying to really say they've believed
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.480]   in Android.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.160]   They have lagged behind of the major forecare ears
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.600]   in the United States.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.520]   Chief marketing officer David Christopher says of Android,
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.000]   they create highly functional, highly capable smartphones
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.040]   that run really well with our network
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.160]   and they're rededicating themselves,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.840]   starting with the Atrix.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.400]   Atrix is their big example.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.600]   They say we got involved very early in the development
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.200]   of that product with Motorola and Google.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.680]   And they say they don't want to do a lot of work
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.160]   to customize Android anymore.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.720]   So are we finally going to see decent?
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.800]   Is the Atrix the change for AT&T, the C change,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.400]   do you think, Gina?
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.160]   - I thought it was the Verizon iPhone.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.760]   That was the C change for AT&T.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.640]   (laughs)
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.480]   - I think that's the C go in the other way though.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.000]   - Yes, yes.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.080]   Yeah, the Atrix was cool.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.320]   You guys, I wasn't at CES,
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   but you guys all sort of was one of your top picks, right?
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.880]   For one of the coolest gadget that you saw at CES.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.920]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.440]   - Yeah, I mean, I think this is, you know,
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.040]   this only makes sense for AT&T and it's long overdue.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.160]   And I don't think that it's a coincidence
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.320]   that it has to, this sort of story is running around the time
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.080]   that the Verizon iPhone got released.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.240]   - We don't think we have to control every element
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.400]   of the smartphone at all.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.600]   Finally.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.960]   - 'Cause that was the biggest problem, wasn't it Kevin?
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.600]   They kept customizing Android in a way that made it awful.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   - If I'm not mistaken, AT&T has the worst track record
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.000]   when it comes to upgrading their Android phones to.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.120]   I think literally at some point it was 0%.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.560]   Like every phone and every device
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.000]   that had been delivered on AT&T's network
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.960]   had never been upgraded.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.160]   My boss at Life Hacker, Adam Pass,
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.960]   she has nothing but quietly couch hatred
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.880]   for his galaxy, S on AT&T.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.440]   I mean, for a long time, iPhone was all that really,
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.240]   it seemed like AT&T necessarily really wanted
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.160]   to support and upgrade and they have a long ways to go.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.760]   But, you know, kudos to them for rededicating themselves.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.160]   - All right, let's take a quick break.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.680]   Thank our other sponsor for this week in Google today's
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.040]   mail route.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.960]   Mail route protects businesses of every size
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.400]   and individuals from spam and viruses.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.000]   If you offer your own email,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.360]   you operate your own email and your own domain name server,
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.560]   you wanna check this out.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.320]   It is a way to revive what might be
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.040]   an otherwise unusable domain name email address.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.160]   I've done it myself.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.040]   It absolutely works.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.920]   Tom Johnson helped write the software
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.440]   that Microsoft acquired and turned into FrontBridge,
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.160]   which is packaged with Microsoft Exchange Hosted Services.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.280]   And he then turned to killing spam
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.040]   and he seems to have done it.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.160]   I don't get any false positives.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.000]   I've checked the vault a few times,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.960]   nothing in there that shouldn't have been in there,
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.000]   and I don't get any spam in my inbox
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.320]   that I use mail route to filter.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.240]   In fact, I need to put it on all my addresses
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.440]   because it's just amazing how it makes your inbox usable again.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.720]   You can try it out for free at mail route.info
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.560]   and as a Twitter listener, you'll get 10% off
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.840]   the life of your account.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.720]   So there's no reason not to give it a shot.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.360]   If you or someone you love can edit an MX record,
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.680]   you can live without spam.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.960]   Give it a shot, mail route.info.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.240]   It's $2 per user per month for 10 users.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.480]   If you're a small business or $30 per user per year
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.800]   for single users and we thank them
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.040]   for their support of this week in Google.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.200]   So who watched the Super Bowl?
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.080]   - Yeah, Calvin, you watched it.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.960]   - Wow, really?
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.680]   - Peripherally, I was getting rid of the Glee Party.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.520]   - Oh, ha!
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.720]   But not even for the commercials?
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.320]   - I got a man in the living room to watch the commercials.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.480]   The Darth Vader commercial, very cute.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.600]   - When you know they're all gonna be on YouTube the next day,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.440]   who really needs to watch the Super Bowl for the commercials?
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.280]   - It's true.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.120]   - You know, that was the thing, right?
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.080]   I missed the first half almost.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.680]   I sadly caught the halftime show,
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.480]   but I missed a lot of the commercials,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   but it wasn't a big deal because I could go
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.560]   and watch them afterwards.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.040]   Although apparently this is the highest rated television show
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.440]   of all time, it beat last year's Super Bowl.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.560]   - Yeah, I'm kind of a dad in reverse.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.920]   I've only ever watched the Wolf of Ads
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.280]   and then to have something talk about my son, Jake,
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.160]   who ended up learning football around me,
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.080]   so he's teaching me football now.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.680]   I actually kind of enjoyed it.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.520]   - Yeah?
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.440]   - Yeah, I did.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.280]   I did.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.280]   I decided to become a Jets fan and root for them
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.920]   and got into watching the games to my surprise.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.760]   I'm discovering my hormones late in life.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.960]   How did that affect your desire to see Super Bowl ads?
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.320]   - I didn't have to wake up to watch the ads.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.760]   - Right, didn't have to rouse yourself.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.080]   - Yeah.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.720]   - The big one was the Zoom.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.920]   Well, the big one in the TechSphere was the Zoom ad,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.160]   which was a kind of almost tired at this point,
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.720]   you know, kind of 1984 Apple-ish ad.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.560]   You know, don't be like the others, get the Zoom tablet.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.080]   - We were talking about this on Tech News today.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.160]   It was sort of tired and old for us
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.880]   that are enthusiasts of technology,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.640]   but it was incomprehensible for anyone
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.440]   who didn't know what it was about.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.680]   - Right, if you didn't get the reference,
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.120]   it was just kind of crazy.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.800]   - Were there white earbuds involved?
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   That was sort of an over--
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.040]   - Yes, that was the only funny thing
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.840]   was the white earbuds, but--
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.680]   - It's like, you know, I'm sitting there.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   I actually heard stories of other people
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.320]   who were in big groups watching the Super Bowl
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.560]   and were then explaining like,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.760]   well, you see it's a metaphor for Apple,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.680]   had a Super Bowl ad, 1984,
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.600]   and now Apple's kind of become, never mind.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.920]   - Right, we need a dollar--
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.240]   - Which is a pretty bad--
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.160]   - Flash the text to like,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.520]   it's a huge amount of subtext to throw out
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.680]   for people who are watching this
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.360]   in a loud living room or a crowded bar, you know?
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.800]   Like, oh look, I catch a cultural reference on the screen.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.880]   - You know, I still don't get it,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.120]   but when can I buy the product?
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.880]   We don't know how much it's gonna be.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.960]   We don't know.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.880]   - But I'm changing.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.680]   There was also the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play ad
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.320]   with the freaky thumbs being sewn on to the Android doll.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.680]   - That's like nightmares.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.520]   - Yeah.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.080]   - Did you see that guys?
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.440]   - I have not seen this one.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.280]   - Oh, you--
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.440]   - Is it yet another scary Android ad?
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.360]   - Yeah, it's thumbs are being implanted
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.280]   onto the little Android green man,
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.360]   and it's really nightmare stuff.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.760]   It's freaky.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.320]   - Oh yes, I'm watching it now, indeed.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.800]   - Yeah, so it's all back, Ali, Dark, scary.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.120]   Exactly what you're saying.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.680]   - All the Android ads are like this.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.240]   What is up with that?
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.800]   The raining robot.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.040]   - Oh my goodness, it's really--
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   - Well, because putting thumbs on an Android doll
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.320]   is illegal in most countries,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320]   so you have to go to a back Ali to do it.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.800]   - Wow.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.760]   - It's just two.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.640]   - I have no idea, like why are they in a--
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.960]   Why is it dark and dirty?
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.880]   Why are they in a back Ali?
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.160]   - You know, and it makes me wonder too,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.720]   there's gotta be some control over the Android brand.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.480]   Who's in charge of the brand at Google
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.440]   that allows that to happen?
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.400]   - It's also awesome for Asian culture to apply,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.920]   like you have to send an Android to a, you know,
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.960]   Vietnam or Thailand to get thumbs onto it,
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.800]   'cause they only do black market thumb
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   at index and design.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.640]   - Yeah, right.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.480]   - That's awesome.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   - That's really where, that's really
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   what is hitting me the most,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.440]   is like, why couldn't he just go to a nice clean hospital?
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.440]   I know, it's awesome.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.280]   - I get his thumbs.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.080]   - But the walls are white and the nurses are pretty.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   - Yeah.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.400]   - White, white, that means Apple, no.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.720]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.560]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.800]   - Android is the dirty underground.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.720]   And the question is, you know,
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.880]   Sony Ericsson Play is the PlayStation phone,
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.280]   but they're not branding it that way.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.400]   They're branding it as Android.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.520]   - Right, which, you know,
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.120]   Android does have a good amount of games now
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:33.960]   that are pretty cool,
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.040]   but whether people like Jeff was just saying,
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.800]   you know, do people need a dedicated Android game device
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.880]   if they have a phone?
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.640]   - I don't know.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.480]   - Yeah, I don't know either.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.160]   I think some, it's weird to me,
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   the people who really would want that
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.360]   are probably people who'd rather have
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.520]   the next generation PlayStation.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.040]   Play a portable PSP.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.880]   - Right, yeah.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.360]   - And then carry a separate phone,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.400]   but I guess there could be a cross-section in there
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.480]   like we were talking about earlier,
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.400]   who just don't wanna carry more than one device.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.480]   - Right, the casual gamers, right,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.720]   aren't gonna get the dedicated device,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.680]   and if they do, it's gonna be the next guest here.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.240]   - We all just said we gave up cameras.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.360]   - Yeah, exactly. - What a phone.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.160]   - Yeah, that's, no, it's a really good point, Jeff.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.800]   And what did you, I have to ask,
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.600]   what did you think of the Groupon ads?
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.160]   - Gave me another reason not to like them,
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.400]   and I've already got some.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.960]   - Now, if you haven't seen the Groupon ads,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.640]   they would start as if they were some kind of
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.080]   public service announcement or an awareness-raising
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.000]   charity type thing, there was one about the oppression
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.160]   of the people in Tibet, one about destruction
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.960]   of the rainforest, but then they would change
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.600]   halfway through and be about getting a discount.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.840]   So the one about the oppression of the Tibetan people
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.960]   turned into a discount on Tibetan food
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.560]   at your local Tibetan restaurant.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.640]   - Tibetan curry noodles.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.880]   - Tibetan curry noodles, that's right.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.200]   And then the one about the rainforest turned into
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.280]   like getting a Brazilian wax or something
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.720]   because not all forests are bad.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.240]   - Yeah. - Or down all forests are good.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.320]   - I didn't know those were Christopher Gats either.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.600]   So now his track record has diminished slightly.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.120]   - Well, now, with the way Groupon,
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.760]   let me see if this washes with any of you.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.080]   The way Groupon tried to defend this was,
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.840]   we actually didn't say anything bad about these causes.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.400]   Saying go get Tibetan noodles does not,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.520]   in any way diminish, you know,
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.440]   trying to work for the plight of Tibetans.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.680]   It doesn't make fun of them.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.080]   And saying, you know, getting a bikini wax
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.080]   doesn't have any effect on the Amazonian rainforest.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.840]   And in fact, we raised awareness about issues
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.920]   that wouldn't have been talked about in a Super Bowl
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.680]   where it is apparently okay to advocate, you know,
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.520]   violence and sexism in all of your ads.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.400]   We're getting in trouble for this.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.680]   - And so we're making fun of their customers really.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.360]   They're making fun of what you guys talk about
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.080]   on Twitter all the time, which is that, you know,
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.640]   Groupon has a lot of salons and spas and, you know,
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.240]   niche restaurants and they're saying, you know,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.680]   haha, you're more likely to get a Brazilian wax
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.480]   than to care about the rainforest in Brazil.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.040]   But then on the website, they actually--
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.720]   - Which kind of exploits the cause.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.560]   - Right.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.400]   - It does.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.200]   - And the website actually has fundraising links
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.640]   for those causes, but whatever,
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.400]   when you're watching the Super Bowl and you're like,
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.480]   hey, look, there's Timothy, you haven't making fun of Tibet.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.720]   It doesn't really, you know,
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.240]   it doesn't really register that well.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.000]   It's not a really easy thing to explain in 30 seconds.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.440]   The deep level of satire they were aiming for.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.360]   - It should have come with a manual.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.680]   - Right.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.520]   - A reader's guy.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.760]   - What does this ad was supposed to mean?
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   Or go to Groupon.com/heads.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.120]   - A viewer's guide to the Groupon commercials.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.280]   - Now, how about Joan Rivers?
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.080]   Speaking of offensive things that turned out
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.040]   and turned it around, I think that Joan Rivers,
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.160]   GoDaddy was brilliant,
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.280]   even though we don't like GoDaddy on the show.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.360]   (laughing)
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.320]   - Go, Jeff.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.240]   - I use GoDaddy.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.000]   I'll come out of the closet.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.680]   But a lot of registrars had, you know,
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.760]   promotions ready to go like that moment,
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.920]   like, you know, drop GoDaddy, you know, leaving gg.com.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.960]   (laughing)
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.240]   Like, ready to go, like Namecheap,
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.080]   I think was one of them.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.240]   You know, they all have their promotions ready to go
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.360]   for like, hey, go Daddy, go ahead and sign up with us.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.960]   - They were anticipating the fourth year
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.000]   of offensive ads.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.640]   Like, you didn't like to go to Addy ad,
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.560]   like, switch to us.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.360]   I mean, that's, you know,
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.560]   that says something about the commercial.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.840]   - I didn't see the Joan Rivers one.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.120]   I saw the other one where they imply
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.920]   that two models are gonna walk naked onto the set,
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.640]   but then they say, go to the website
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.280]   to see the part, couldn't show on TV.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.120]   And I never did.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.480]   - Oh, that was tough.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.160]   And that was typical.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.000]   That's what I expected Adam.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.840]   What was the Joan Rivers ad?
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.120]   - Just you see, you're getting ready to see the body.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.080]   You're seeing the whole thing.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:38.920]   You're seeing the legs.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.800]   And then finally the lights go on and it's Joan Rivers
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:45.800]   with padding sufficient to float an airline.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.060]   - See, now that's the same concept as Groupon.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.480]   - No, it's different because they were making
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.320]   fun of themselves.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.120]   - That's the rest you want to think Joan Rivers is a cause.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.200]   - That's the most expensive.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.040]   - She could be.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.240]   - In some ways maybe she is, but you're right.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.520]   - There was a living social ad that was like,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.000]   living social changed my life and it starts out with this guy.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.760]   And then you can see him like, go get a manny petty
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.960]   and go admire these shoes and go get a makeup job done.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.880]   In the end, he's like a total transvestite.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.760]   Like completely, he's like,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.880]   "It changed my life."
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.360]   And he kind of like sashays by,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   I like that a lot better than, I mean,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.120]   I don't know how many like manly football watching guys
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.600]   thought it was better, but I like that a lot better
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.280]   than the Groupon take for sure.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.840]   - And then Salesforce was there
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.760]   with their social networking tool for enterprise.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.240]   - Starring the black eyed peas.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.080]   They're very confusing.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.520]   - But it really made me feel like it was 1999 again.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.680]   Just seeing kind of a cheesy dot com ad.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.240]   There were a lot of tech ads in the Super Bowl this year.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   - It says something about this one.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.760]   - It says something about the wide doing its buyback program.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.520]   - All right, with Beiber, Justin Beiber and Aussie Osborne,
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.400]   which funnily enough, I actually knew that ad was coming
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.560]   for that product and after the ad was over,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.600]   I had to stop and think to remember what it was for.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.800]   I didn't think they did a good job
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.240]   of explaining the buyback program, but it was very funny.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.720]   - It's a complicated program.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.680]   - Right, because you have to pay in advance
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.960]   to be able to sell your device back later.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.560]   - What?
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.880]   - Yeah.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.720]   - How many process?
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.560]   - Oh, best buy.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.000]   - It's like buying insurance.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.560]   It's like, oh, you know, if you give us
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.200]   a little extra money now, then you'll be able to trade this
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.200]   in for the new phone, laptop, tablet, whatever,
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.400]   when it comes out.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.120]   - Can you ever trust the people who are trying to sell you
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.520]   $120 cables?
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.360]   - No.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   - Like, can you ever really say,
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.840]   oh, they must have a program based on merit and--
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.320]   - The only thing about this one is the price is all set
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.160]   going in.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.360]   It's like the warranty stuff that stores sell you,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.760]   you know, as a rule doesn't work.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.240]   In this case, I think the price is too high,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.800]   but you use, you know, you can sell it on your own on,
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.200]   on eBay, which we all promised you and don't do.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.080]   We can use our wonderful advertiser here on Twig.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.160]   Remind me of the name real quick,
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.000]   - Giselle.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:54.840]   - Giselle.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.240]   - Thank you, Giselle.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.280]   And now, obviously it's a work well in a frigzel,
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.360]   the best buy is getting into it.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.120]   You pay $59.99 upfront.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.600]   If you buy a $1,000 thing in six months,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.520]   they'll buy it back from here for $500 and that's guaranteed.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.320]   They're going down from 50% over six months down
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.160]   to 20% over two years.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.000]   Those prices are high.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.240]   Yes.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.000]   But the interesting thing is now,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.760]   to me, with a bigger deal here is Giselle proved a market.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.400]   They proved this middleman for second use
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.960]   to be able to trade in and get the new cool thing market.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   - Yeah, I know it goes best.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.080]   - As a big best buy shopper,
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.080]   I would not trust them on any of this stuff though.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.120]   It's probably not worth it.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.480]   You can easily go to Giselle or there's a couple
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.160]   other Giselle competitors out there
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.720]   that do the same sort of thing and get more money
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.040]   than you could get by having to pay in advance.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   That's just, I go to a place like Best Buy
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.280]   because it's convenient because I don't want to have
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.400]   to wait for it to come in the mail.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.240]   - Right.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.320]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.280]   - All right, real quickly, Google got new office buildings
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.720]   down in LA.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.360]   Frank Geary designed office building.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.560]   They're apparently a travel destination.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.480]   If you look in travel books,
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.040]   they're building with giant binocular shaped facade
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.000]   a fixture in Venice, California near the beach.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.400]   This was announced exactly the same day
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.480]   as Facebook announced their new corporate headquarters.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.440]   They're moving into the old Sun campus in Menlo Park,
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.600]   often referred to as Sun Quinton
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.200]   because of its architecture.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.040]   (laughing)
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.880]   - Nice.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.200]   - But everybody's getting big, everybody's expanding.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.000]   I don't know if there's much--
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.840]   - Fitch mancy digs.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.600]   - Yeah, I don't know if there's more to say about that.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.360]   Yeah, we're getting close to wrapping up
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.760]   so let's get into the tips.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.400]   Kevin, do you have one to pass along to us today?
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.760]   - I do, and this was actually the source
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.600]   of a little back and forth on a Google group
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.360]   I saw recently.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:00.120]   The email app for Android, so not the Gmail app,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.280]   but the standard email if you were using your email
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.400]   through a corporate server or exchange or something like that.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.600]   Maybe GINA has a nicer way of putting it,
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.840]   but it kind of sucks.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.120]   The email app is not that great,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.760]   or at least a lot of users have a lot of complaints about it.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.840]   And it's gotten a little better over the few Android versions,
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.480]   but to a lot of people it's not powerful enough,
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.080]   it's nowhere close to as good as the Gmail app.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.800]   So search the Android market for K9 mail,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.840]   like you would say, like a dog, K9 and then mail,
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.000]   and that is an app that continues to be pretty amazing
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.120]   in terms of supporting lots of different features,
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   giving you all kinds of IMAP folder control.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.640]   Basically, if you don't like the email app on Android,
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.400]   you're going to love K9 mail.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.040]   There were the really interesting discussion recently,
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.320]   or at least I saw it recently about
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   whether or not it was gonna get merged into the email app,
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.320]   and because they're both open source projects and whatnot.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.360]   And Google has said that they're not going to just
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.480]   kind of wholesale import this kind of interesting fork
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.520]   of their email app.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:15.280]   But if there's a feature that's missing from Android,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.960]   from the email app, and it's probably in K9 mail.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.920]   So search the Android market for K9 mail, grab it,
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.640]   and you'll have a lot more control
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   and much more ease of use for your non-gmail email on Android.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.720]   - These are my favorite moments in Twig
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.240]   when before you're even finished talking,
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.600]   I'm off searching and downloading.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.720]   - Oh, and now you can grab it from the Android market.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.040]   You can go to the web browser right now,
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.880]   and fling it to your device,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.720]   which is such an amazing thing for bloggers in particular
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.040]   to be able to point people to actual web pages.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.440]   - And it's amazing, permalinks, taps, it's crazy.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.880]   - Oh, oh, oh, I know.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.680]   Yeah, that's a huge innovation.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.120]   It's letter K number nine, right?
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.920]   - Right, exactly. - And then mail.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   - All right, Gina, what do you got for us this week?
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.360]   - Cool, my tip is also for folks getting their email
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.920]   on their phone, this is actually for Gmail users.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.440]   The web-based version of Gmail,
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.520]   which you're probably using if you use an iPhone,
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.160]   if you're not using the built-in mail app.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.480]   Now has priority inbox support.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.680]   So if you've been using mail app, mail that app,
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.720]   do you use mail that app on your iPhone, Tom?
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.560]   - No, I don't.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.600]   I just use the built-in--
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.200]   - Like the built-in mail client.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.000]   - Yeah, yeah, I use IMAP.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.160]   - IMAP, mm-hmm.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.840]   If you use the web-based version of Gmail
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.800]   and you have enabled priority inbox in your Gmail inbox,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.880]   it now, you can now have access to the priority inbox.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.320]   - That's pretty nifty.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.440]   - Messages, yeah, so the important messages,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.360]   the messages that Google things are important.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.720]   - All the messages that aren't from PR people.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.280]   - Right, exactly, exactly.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.480]   So when you first go to Gmail in your web browser,
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.360]   on your phone, you go to your regular inbox,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.440]   but if you tap on the menu button and go back,
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.240]   you can see that priority inbox will show up,
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.720]   so you can see, you know, you can say,
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.160]   just show me all the email marked as important and unread,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.160]   which might be a little easier
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.120]   when you're working on a small screen.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.600]   - That's cool, you know, I just, I have the mail app
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.920]   and I have all my accounts.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.240]   I have a Yahoo and a Gmail and a couple others.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.080]   And so I just like to read it all in one place,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.240]   but you know, I would like to take advantage
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.200]   of priority inbox, that's pretty, that's pretty attractive.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.440]   - Cool.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.800]   - All right, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, we have a number today.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.800]   - Relate sheet.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.160]   - Relate, is it okay?
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.960]   It's related to the big story of the week though.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.360]   - Yeah, it's 315, which is $350 million,
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.440]   which is the price that AOL, of course,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.600]   is paying for Huffington Post.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.720]   Much, much, much talk about that this week,
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.240]   it happened on Monday.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.200]   I weighed in, I think it's a smart move.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.080]   I think that if you saw the PowerPoint
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.160]   that was leaked last week to Business Insider
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.960]   about AOL's content strategy,
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   it may look quite like a mechanistic animal farm
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.720]   and really kind of show there isn't a content strategy.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.200]   Tim Armstrong's view is to be a gigantic content company,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.320]   so we can be a bit gigantic ad company.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.880]   Ariana, I think, brings humanity to that.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.000]   She's been brilliant about getting people
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.920]   to want to use a platform.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.640]   Yes, I'm a controversy to do it for free,
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.960]   but nobody puts a gun to their head
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.840]   and she provides some value for that.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.520]   I cross post things at Huffington Post
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.480]   because I get seen.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.800]   And she has the value of aggregation
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.600]   and she understands the value of links and social.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.680]   Importantly, I think that Jonah Peretti,
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.720]   who was the head of technology at Huffington Post
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.800]   from the start, was getting no attention at the beginning,
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.000]   but then people were coming back around saying,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.320]   "Don't forget the value that Jonah added to Huffington Post
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.760]   "to make it really easy to create incredible new applications
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.160]   "and new metrics to make Huffington Post work."
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.600]   So Ariana's gonna take charge,
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.320]   not just of Huffington Post,
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.280]   but also of all of the content at AOL,
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.440]   including, yes, even Michael Arrington.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.280]   - And Gajan and Tekron, right?
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.600]   - Josh Topolsky and Michael Arrington report
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.560]   to Ariana Huffington.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.400]   We're sure about this.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.320]   She's not just being brought in as a head of editorial,
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.280]   but she's out of the reporting chain.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.320]   - She's vice president in charge of all things content.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.600]   So that'll be fun to watch.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.880]   I'm about Gary to never really ask
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.720]   whether she was gonna go to four hour staff meetings
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.800]   like he's had to go to.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.800]   Nick Denton said that they gave out too early.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   Others said the price was too high.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.280]   We'll see where this goes.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.240]   But the interesting thing to me was in this,
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.720]   that I asked Monday,
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.320]   I've long asked, why didn't any publisher
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.440]   start Huffington Post?
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.760]   Why didn't the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, BBC,
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.720]   the only company in the world that came close
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.720]   was starting, the Guardian starting to come in as free.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.960]   But more as a statement about the relationship with the public
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.440]   rather than as a business.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.240]   And I think the reason is because
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.960]   Huffington Post was just too populist.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.480]   It gave too much respect to us, the people,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.560]   and big media companies to this day
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.360]   can't quite swallow that.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.760]   Whereas AOL is looking for a content strategy,
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.120]   and there's Ariana.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.880]   And I think that,
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.560]   the final thing to say about this is that
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.400]   when she started, when Ariana sat down with the keyboard,
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.600]   lots of people laughed, including me.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.800]   I was wrong.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.480]   She built an incredible company.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.520]   And so now they're being paid $350 million for that.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.760]   So I think it's well worth watching where that goes.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.280]   Now the next question becomes, of course, immediately,
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.960]   who's next?
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.000]   Henry Blodgett was laughing on Twitter today
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.400]   that Andrew Ross Sorkin was asking him about the rumors
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.160]   that business insiders in play and Henry say,
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.080]   what am I supposed to say?
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.120]   And Andrew's saying, well, usually you should say
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.840]   that I don't comment on rumors.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.560]   And there's talk of maybe gawkers up for sale.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.600]   And of course, I think the rumor we should start right now,
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.680]   here and now, before your very eyes,
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.800]   that Twits isn't playing.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   It's huge.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.640]   That's true.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.480]   - Sure. - That's not on playing
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.400]   with penguins.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.800]   He's negotiating with gigantic money out there.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.040]   - Well, Leo's out of the country.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.960]   - Do that or why don't we just sell it off underneath him?
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.800]   - Yeah.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.560]   - He gets back and he has a new boss.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.640]   - Lisa?
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.560]   - Did you do that?
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.940]   - She signs the checks.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:12.600]   No, I, wow, can you imagine?
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.280]   I can't.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.040]   Actually, I can and it frightens me.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.840]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.160]   - But I don't think Leo would go to work for a big media company
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.320]   'cause he's so disdainful.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.400]   - That's why he's here.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.400]   - Yeah. - So them wrong.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.280]   - Yeah. - And why they'd be here.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.120]   But it is interesting to ask.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.760]   I mean, so that's why the New York Times, CNN at all,
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.560]   never would have bought Huffington Post either.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.640]   - What about something like a revision three
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.920]   or a next new networks or, you know?
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.760]   - Well, that's the question.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.120]   And so where do these kinds of companies go
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.880]   and is there a roll up for the likes of Twits?
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.080]   I love talking about this behind Leo's back
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.680]   and we'll see what he says when he gets back.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   But I think that what it says is, importantly,
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.720]   that these new media ventures,
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.880]   such as the ones that Ariana and Leo have started
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.360]   have real value.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.200]   - You know, that--
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.920]   - That they are truly new and that matters.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.920]   - That memo that you were referring to earlier from AOL
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.920]   was scarily familiar to me.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.280]   And it's what happens when you have an editorial company
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.320]   that is no longer run by the editors.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.160]   Or that, not even no longer run,
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.480]   but where the editors no longer have a voice.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.120]   And I believe what Tim Armstrong is doing
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.360]   is trying to bring in strong editorial voices
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.040]   to counter what he sees happening in his own company.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.000]   Because you could be the CEO of a company
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.920]   who believes strongly in content
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.720]   and yet not be able to influence
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   the people who work for you far enough that way.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.480]   And so you need to balance out the equation.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.560]   Because if they followed that,
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.200]   I mean, I know I've talked to some people
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.840]   who are really into SEO and into marketing.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.360]   They thought that memo was brilliant.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.680]   That's exactly what, you know, it's like,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.080]   no, there's huge imbalances in that
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.760]   regarding the quality of content
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.320]   and things that are going to end up narrowing
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.360]   and blowing off your audience.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.120]   The only question I have about Ariana Huffington is,
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   will she be too divisive internally?
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.160]   Because she has a public persona of being a partisan
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.760]   and having a particular political point of view.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.720]   And now she's going to be in charge of, you know,
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.680]   a gadget blog, but tech crunch more, I think,
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.880]   to the point that I could,
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.160]   you can see a lot of headbudding there,
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.520]   which would be less productive.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.280]   - Let me put it this way, Tom.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:33.120]   I think that Ariana could charm even Michael Arrington.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.680]   - Wow, okay. - Yes, it's true.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.520]   - Fair enough.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.320]   All right, let's finish up real quick.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.680]   I've got a tool for you.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.560]   I have just recently switched over to Chrome
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.120]   as my primary browser.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.280]   One of the things that I miss from Firefox, thank you,
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.760]   is no script.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.400]   I am a huge fan of no script.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.600]   And when I say primary browser, I mean that.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.120]   Like I still use Firefox and Opera and Safari,
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.640]   you know, in varying amounts,
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.440]   but Chrome has become my go-to.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   And so I found not script at chrome.google.com/extensions.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.800]   You can just do a search for not scripts and Chrome,
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.560]   and you should find it.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:17.960]   Not script allows you to take control of the scripts
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.360]   in a very no script like way.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.080]   There's a few limitations in the way Chrome handles its API
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.320]   that don't allow it to do exactly what no script does.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.560]   And they're actually very good in the documentation
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.320]   of laying out what it is that they don't do
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.760]   and what workarounds you could have.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.600]   For instance, you can turn off Java,
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.560]   you can turn off Java scripting in Chrome
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:43.560]   and then allow not script to whitelist stuff.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.160]   It's a little more, it's a little less convenient
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.000]   than no script.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.680]   It also doesn't provide some of the clickjacking
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.840]   protection that no script does.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.520]   But hey, it's the best thing I've found.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.120]   And the only real disadvantage of it is you have to set up
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.200]   a password for it in a user file yourself.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.600]   You have to go use a text editor.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.880]   Not that big a deal, just again, not very convenient.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.960]   But once you got it up and running,
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.400]   it just gives you a little pyramid up in the address bar
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.240]   that you can click on
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.080]   and you can approve scripts temporarily,
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.560]   you can approve scripts forever for certain sites.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.120]   It comes with a whitelist preloaded
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.560]   so that things like google.com are already there
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.200]   and you can edit that whitelist yourself.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.200]   So it's better to me than any kind of like naked running
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.600]   on the internet that you would have to do otherwise.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.280]   So I recommend it.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.120]   - Naked running.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.080]   - That's what I feel like when I'm just allowing
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.600]   any script to execute.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.440]   - Yeah.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.920]   - That's the kind of thing I would say.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   (laughs)
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.800]   - Well, you're in Amsterdam though.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.120]   (laughs)
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.200]   - There's lots of naked running in Amsterdam.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.480]   - I'm in bicycle riding.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.320]   - Yeah.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.160]   - I actually rode a bicycle to lunch and to dinner
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.000]   because there's no cabs in this weird hotel I'm in.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.360]   Out in the middle of nowhere in the suburbs of Amsterdam.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   So there I am looking rather like a scene
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.360]   out of the Wicked Witch of the West.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.200]   (laughs)
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.960]   - But they've got an entire garage full of bikes though
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.280]   and at the hotel, right?
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:12.960]   - Yes.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.880]   - In Amsterdam's bike city.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.120]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:15.960]   - They're so unique though.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.800]   That's the question.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.640]   - Too cold.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.280]   - It's always the question.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.920]   Not this heavy here.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.760]   All right.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.960]   Thanks everybody for being on the show.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.280]   Kevin Purdy, let folks know about your book
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.440]   and where they can find your work on Life Hacker.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.280]   - Okay.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.880]   Well, at Life Hacker.com, which has a brand-spaking
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.080]   new design that you may or may not have heard about.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.320]   And at the complete Android guide,
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   which is completeandroidguide.com,
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.640]   which is a how-to guide for Android
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.560]   and is getting updated now to include things
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.640]   like K9 Mail.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.160]   - Gina Trepani. - Kevin.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.000]   - Yeah.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.280]   - Wait, you can tell us,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.760]   what do you think of the design?
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.440]   - I like writing for Life Hacker.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.080]   (laughs)
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:58.920]   - You know what?
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.440]   I'll tell you, Jeff, I like the new design.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.280]   - Well done.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.360]   - I'm a big fan of Life Hacker and I09.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.200]   And you know what?
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.880]   You can scroll down in that right side forever.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.120]   If you wanna see the headlines of things,
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.640]   it works fine for me.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.480]   I don't know why.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.440]   (laughs)
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.640]   Sorry, Kevin, I enjoyed that.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.720]   Thank you.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.560]   - That was great.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.720]   - I enjoy entering text in the CMS.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.480]   (laughs)
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.800]   - Now that we've,
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.400]   now that we've endangered Kevin's job,
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.600]   Gina, how are things going at smartaware.org?
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.080]   - Things are growing great.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.520]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.400]   Yeah, yeah, it's one of our,
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.720]   that org or on Twitter.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.960]   And you should buy my app.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.480]   It's search for to do text, Android Market.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.200]   That's my awkward plug.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.080]   - I am also a big fan of ThinkUp.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.920]   I use that. - Yay!
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.160]   - I run it as well,
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   especially now that I can just run it
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.760]   with the auto updates through the RSS.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.760]   It's great.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.600]   - Woo!
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.280]   - Take a look at ThinkUp as well, folks.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.600]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you for staying up
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.840]   and being with us in your wonderfully lit hotel room.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.920]   - It's like being interrogated.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.800]   I can't wait to put this back on.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.560]   - You don't know the lengths this man went to
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.920]   to even be able to appear in some kind of light.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.920]   So we thank him for that.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.400]   Of course, buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   And let people know where else they can find you on the net.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.240]   - That's pretty much it.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.960]   Working on the book, Public Parts,
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.520]   the first manuscript edits going on
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.360]   with the editor right now.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.800]   So we're getting there out this year.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.640]   - Woo!
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.040]   Congratulation.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.880]   That's great.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.720]   - Well, I'm not there yet, but, I mean, you know,
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.040]   we're getting that far as to where they have congratulations.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.400]   - That's amazing.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.320]   - No small shakes.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.200]   - Yeah.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.480]   - Leo Report will be out for one more this week in Google.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.680]   So I'll be back next week hosting with Jeff and Gina.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.320]   And then we'll be back in two weeks.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.080]   Thanks everybody for watching or listening.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.640]   We'll see you next time.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:59.980]   .
