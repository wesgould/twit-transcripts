[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.520]   This is Twig, this week in Google.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.360]   Episode 58, recorded September 1, 2010, Professor 2.0.

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's time for Twig, the show that covers the latest from Google
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.520]   and the cloud, Gina Trapani, is in the cloud.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   See, she's floating along, a little puffy little cloud.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.920]   What up?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.160]   What up, Gina?
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.920]   Gina is the blogger at smarterware.org,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   creator of Life Hacker.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.280]   And she writes and works--
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120]   it's not just writes anymore for Fast Company.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.840]   Does video for Fast Company?
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   My first video came out today.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   Yay!
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.080]   Yeah, fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240]   It's not Leo's, but it's the first episode.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.040]   Check it out.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.400]   Fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'm typing it right now, slash worksmart.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.320]   And is worksmart the name of your show?
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.400]   Yeah, it's the name of the series.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.960]   With Gina Trapani.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   There she is.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.600]   A weekly productivity Q&A.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.360]   Hey, is that how it works?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   Well, TV ad.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.440]   Is there?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah, look at that.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.160]   It's the smart meeting notes.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.720]   It's the top post is the new video.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.320]   Oh, that's an ad, not an ad, that's a post.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, that's a post.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.160]   Kind of does look like an ad, though.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.760]   I don't blame you.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.720]   It sure did.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.440]   Apple TV transformed, given market killing price of $99.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.080]   What they left out here is Google
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.200]   breathes a sigh of relief, in my opinion.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.280]   And Amazon, too.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   And Amazon, too.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.120]   And Roku and a lot of people, Samsung, a lot of people
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.000]   in this business of television, internet television,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.520]   and apps, I think must have watched with trepidation
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.320]   as Apple entered the market.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   And in this case, Apple, I think,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.800]   chose to be a pretty conservative.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.960]   What's the one thing you think that they should have done?
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.160]   Could have done to be--
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.920]   You bought one, so they must have done something right, Jeff.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.880]   The price.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.800]   $99.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.320]   You bought it just because it was cheap.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.240]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.400]   So before I've already gotten crap from people,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.600]   you could spare me people.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.960]   I've already gotten lots of Twitter jokes
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.120]   about how I'm going to re-box it.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880]   Which is what you did with the iPad.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.680]   So the idea is Apple TV was always--
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.840]   Apple says a hobby.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.360]   They said they announced this with a slide that said,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.280]   "Oh, one more thing."
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.080]   And thing was crossed out and said, "Hobby."
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.840]   So they're clearly not attempting
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   to take over the world here.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.040]   But they reinvented Apple TV, taking out any storage,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.640]   putting the A4 chip in it, making it much smaller,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.120]   no fan, no power brick, silent.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.320]   And because it doesn't have any storage,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.160]   it's a streaming device only.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   They announced 99 cent television show rentals.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.760]   Rentals not purchases.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.240]   They said no more purchases.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.680]   Because where would you put it?
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.560]   And since they don't have cloud storage yet,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.600]   you can't store it with Apple.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.720]   So 99 cents.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.520]   And you have to rent it for two days.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.240]   Movies will be $2.99 to $4.99, depending on how new they are.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'll tell you where I think they went, Ron Jeff.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.520]   I think they had a huge opportunity,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.400]   given that it is obviously an iOS device running an A4 chip,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   to put apps on it.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.120]   I really, really thought they were going to basically
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480]   do an iPhone with an HDMI connector,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.360]   and perhaps an iPhone remote control, an iPad remote
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.720]   controller, even the Magic Trackpad.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   But sized for that screen.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.880]   And apps, apps would have been huge.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   It would have given companies like Fox and NBC and ABC
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.920]   a chance to make their own app to go right to the users.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.360]   Netflix would have been an automatic,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   because Netflix is already on the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.360]   And Google TV is going to be Chrome based, right?
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.080]   Well, it's Android based, right?
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   Android based.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.880]   So it will have apps.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.560]   Google-- well, we guess so.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.640]   That's what they demoed, right?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.560]   And so Google now suddenly can steal a march on them.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.480]   We talked about a lot on Mac break weekly,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.680]   and the consensus was Apple was conservative here,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   and probably felt like Google would fumble it.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.480]   So they weren't too worried.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.160]   But I think this was Apple's last chance
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.840]   to make a preemptive move.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.280]   They could have gone in there so strong,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.560]   given how many apps there are out there,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.440]   how many partnerships they have with apps,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.400]   that would have just not Google out of the box.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.520]   Tina, what do you think?
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   You didn't buy one, did you?
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.400]   I did not buy one, but they did nail the price point.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.000]   I mean, the price point on all the things
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   that they announced today was really very, very tempting.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.480]   It does seem like they had to refresh Apple TV
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   to have something to compete with Google TV, which
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.320]   is due out for the holiday season, right?
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   So I mean, we were probably looking at November, December,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   right?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.800]   I'm not sure if Google gave a release date.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.640]   They didn't.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.120]   They didn't.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   They didn't.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.240]   But man, it's sexy, it's small, it's gorgeous.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480]   I can totally understand why Jeff bought it.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   I already have one of these.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.200]   This is a Roku box.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.600]   Actually, you do too, because we see you.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   You do too, thanks to you.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.640]   And it does all of the things--
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.040]   we get Netflix on it.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.760]   We can get Amazon rentals, as well as purchases.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.400]   It's got an app store that puts Twitch on there, Pandora,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.720]   all your slideshows.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.160]   It really has the functionality.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.800]   In fact, it has the functionality plus of the Apple TV.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.720]   It's just a little bit bigger, but not much.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.520]   I could still hold it in the palm of my hand.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   Why, Gina, would you buy--
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   or actually, I should ask you, Jeff, why would you buy that
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.120]   when you've already got this?
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   I'm going to blame you and my wife asks to buy this.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.160]   Well, I'm on this week at Google.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.600]   I have to notice this.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.840]   OK, so this is the problem with all of us.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   I mean, we buy these things because it's our job.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   But if you were--
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.760]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.720]   Here's somebody in Twitter, a German correspondent
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.360]   named, we give him his credit, Carsten Lem, who says,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.120]   you know, it made a gadget-- an impulse buy.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yeah, because it's 99 bucks.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.960]   And an unbox, right.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.720]   Why don't people buy Roku boxes?
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.600]   They're 89 bucks.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.240]   They just don't have the brand.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   Your Mac break show was that it also
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.240]   syncs with my world in iTunes.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   That's powerful.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.640]   By the way, that's another thing Apple announced.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   It kind of relates to us.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.640]   They announced a social network called Ping
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.800]   that's built into iTunes.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.920]   It's music sharing, music discovery, artists.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.320]   It has a Twitter model where you could follow people
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.160]   or you can be more public.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.040]   But you could have a completely private feed if you want.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.400]   Again, I thought, lack encourage,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.240]   I thought it was an opportunity to preempt a Google Me
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.040]   and perhaps steal a march on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   It certainly puts my space out of business
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.720]   because now if you're an artist, I don't know.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.920]   Do independent artists get to create accounts on there?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   I don't know.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.320]   If you're an artist, it seems to me that's an opportunity.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.160]   That's a really good point.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   Go ahead.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   But can you get to Ping in the browser?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.800]   I mean, you have to use iTunes.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   Have to use iTunes.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   That is just such a bad idea.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.400]   It's very retro.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.760]   Yeah, I mean, the idea of connecting to my Facebook account
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.520]   and iTunes just makes me want to hurl.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.760]   I'm just like double twist me.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.200]   Please, I can't deal with that idea.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   It feels like just another reason why I don't want to use iTunes
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240]   and why would you build a whole nother web browser?
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.520]   You know, I mean, suddenly you're browsing web content
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.880]   and iTunes.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.720]   I don't know.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.160]   I mean, I think this is going to work for a lot of people
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.880]   who are just super invested in their iTunes library.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.480]   And I think there are a lot of people that are
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.560]   after having, you know, five or six iPods over the years.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.480]   But yeah, I mean, if you can't get to Ping in the web browser,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.600]   it's like useless.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.680]   I feel like more of the more the fact
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.000]   that you can't get it through Facebook.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.680]   Well, that's all.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.920]   They were not clear about that.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.440]   Just make a Facebook app for this.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.880]   There are, you know, competitive music taste apps in Facebook.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.400]   People are also invested in.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   This is really Apple.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.120]   This is 100% Apple.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   So Apple.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.720]   Waldgarden, our way or the highway, you do it within our universe.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.200]   They certainly make money at this.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   I don't think it's it promotes, you know, anything that you
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.480]   and I think is any good.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   It's not about the link economy.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   It's not it's not open.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.040]   It's proprietary.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.200]   I think the social is not social.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.400]   It's not social really.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.120]   It's social within a limited social.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.760]   You know, this is as social as a, as a, you know,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.400]   an 80s disco, I guess.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.200]   But, but Apple has the velvet velvet rope,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.080]   the Waldgarden, whatever you want to say.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.160]   And I think that's, you know, the issue for both Google and Apple
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.120]   is that they're just not social companies.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.760]   Apple's a design company and Google's a tech company
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.080]   and Facebook is a social company.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.520]   Right.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   That's why Facebook wins over and over and over again.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.080]   They understand.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.760]   I don't know if I said this when I was up there in the cottage
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.080]   if I did stop me, Leo.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.320]   But when I talked to Zuckerberg when I interviewed him
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   about the idea that he was creating a data for data economy
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.560]   and he said, no, you're you're the wrong framing.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.360]   It's an interaction for interaction.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.640]   The reason people do this stuff is to interact with other people.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.280]   It's not to get information and things like that.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.400]   And so he's, you know, he's just always looking at it
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.080]   in a social frame.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   And Apple can't and Google can't.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.920]   Interesting, very interesting.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.320]   Did, did Steve look particularly mean sad and muted
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.680]   when he was discussing the social stuff and then kind of perk up
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.920]   when he talked about that?
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.080]   That's what my friends were like, Steve seemed morose.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   He hates social networking.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.320]   It's like he had to do it.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   Because he had to do it.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   No, he had to do it.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   I could very well be.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.760]   He knows the game bloggers.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.320]   It could very well have been demanded by the labels
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.840]   because of course the big winners on this are artists and labels
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   who are going to create artist pages, sell more records.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's and I'm sure the labels were saying, look, iTunes is going
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.840]   to get out of date if you don't put some social in it pretty damn quick.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.720]   So I think it's it may well be just the labels made him this.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.040]   That's how Steve acts when the labels make him do something morose.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.320]   What was the last time Apple did social in back to the days when way,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.520]   way, way back when what was there?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.760]   What was their portal and access service?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.160]   Oh, what was the name?
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.640]   Was mobile me social at all?
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.080]   Never.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   No, no, they had a service way back when they had their own basically
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.120]   access service, which I was a member and they even they had like a picture
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.080]   of a town and you move it around.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.000]   Was their own AOL?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.080]   And it was a big flaw.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.600]   Chatero.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.120]   Chatero.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   We'll tell you a minute.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.560]   Chatero.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.040]   We'll tell us E world.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Is that it?
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.040]   It was a little remembered.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   Clearly made an impression.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.680]   I wonder if there's a it was that there last and only time to do social.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   As far as I know.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.400]   So so so Apple has.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.960]   If you if you Google Google Apple E world, of course, you get the images
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   for all time.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.680]   Right, Apple didn't couldn't jump off the cliff.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:23.920]   They couldn't quite bring themselves to to go after Facebook or go after Google.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.960]   Does Google now have an opportunity with Google TV and can they make it happen?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.680]   Can they execute?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.560]   I think they have an opportunity, but I think there's a lot of reasonable questions
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.760]   about whether they can execute on that opportunity.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   There's the E world.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   Tell the cue.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.080]   I remember that very well.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.400]   And it's that it's that Mac system seven look.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.800]   What year was this?
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.440]   I was a long time ago.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.440]   You know what?
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   She probably wasn't born.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.640]   That's so friggin pressing 1985.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   Gina.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   Come on.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   Okay.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   You were three years old.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   And then he.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   Okay.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   And tell you old lady.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.040]   Oh, that age was probably programming for it.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.920]   I was starting to learn basic at 10.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.280]   I was on my PC junior.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.120]   I didn't have a Mac when I was a kid.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.080]   So once again, does Google now have an opportunity?
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.640]   You know, there's even there are even people out there who say, oh, is it 90 says 94 and
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   96?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.200]   It was the early 90s.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   Yeah, it was before browser.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   Apple link.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.560]   Apple link was 85.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.880]   So so E world was 94 to 96.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   Okay.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Thank you.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.280]   Sadly, timed with the launch of the commercial browser in October.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   Right.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   Something happened called the Internet.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   Mosaic.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   Mosaic.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   People didn't really want to browser anymore.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.560]   You know, I mean, Google made deals with making deals with hardware manufacturers.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.720]   That's, you know, maybe one advantage.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.120]   But that's there are those who say there are those who say this isn't ever going to
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.840]   happen that Google that will never be able to get this to happen that that Google TV
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   is pie in the sky.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.160]   You think we'll actually see a device.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.680]   Really, it's when you get down to it in the end, if you can bring Android or Chrome to
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.640]   the TV, that's the goal, because through that you get the role of entertainment.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   You get the web.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.680]   And if you can do it in a decent, uh, structure and put a business model behind it, then it's
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   not, it's not as if it's that hard.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   It's that it's hard.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   You know what's hard?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   User interface is hard.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.840]   Apple knows it and does it and this good at it.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.240]   Well, you look at that new nano and I mean, oh my God, that's gorgeous postage stamp
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.080]   size screen.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.120]   They, they know they're the only people who could do it.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.600]   I wouldn't expect you to be able to do it.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   It's two problems.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.480]   You know, I think it's, it's UI and it's the last inch.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.200]   Yeah, the last inch is tough too.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   Right.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.640]   The connection to the internet to the TV is still elusive.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.240]   But let's say Google makes a box roughly the same size, stuff, same price.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.880]   It would be a logic tech, I guess, is the manufacturer that you hook up by HDMI.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.640]   It's running Android.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.480]   You control it from an Android phone.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.120]   This is by the way, it's that it's not even the last inch.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   It's the last six feet because you got the inch, which is the hockey puck to the TV.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.600]   It's how do you get to the hockey puck?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.040]   How do you control that?
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.320]   You have to have an Android phone.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.680]   Well, that's not a very good solution.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.720]   Do you, what do you have?
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.800]   A wireless keyboard and mouse.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.440]   That's really an awful solution.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   Web TV time.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.000]   We've been there before.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.600]   Maybe I'm wrong, you don't want the browser.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   No.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   You just want TV.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   I just got a new Sony TV.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   Remember I was speaking to Sony?
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   They didn't pay me.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.480]   I got a TV instead.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   And it has the connection.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   It's not bad.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   I take it.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   And my wife's not happy because we didn't need another TV.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   We're going to pay taxes on it now.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   But that's not the story.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   It's a great TV.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   I'm happy.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.160]   So 52 inches.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.160]   It's really nice.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   That's nice.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   Great picture.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   And it has apps, doesn't it?
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   It has ethernet and has apps.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.040]   But you know, why can't get us on it?
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   No.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.400]   We're on the popcorn hour and the Yahoo TV.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.880]   Does Pandora, is Pandora on it?
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   Is Netflix on it?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   It didn't look.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   Netflix must be on it, right?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.840]   But the problem is that we're heading towards something far worse than Betamax.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.320]   The bulketization here.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   Right.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.120]   That people start doing deals and you can get it on this box and not that box.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.640]   That's going to be killing for the explosion of TV.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.840]   And it's in the interest of both the cable companies and the TV networks for this to
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.240]   say, "balcanize" as long as possible.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.040]   At least the cable companies for sure.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   Yes.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.200]   If I'm a content creator, or I own a lot of content like the networks do, I'd love to
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.040]   just intermediate the cable companies.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.280]   I think so at some point, but they also get a guaranteed monetization from those cable
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.760]   companies.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.440]   They own cable channels that are subsidized, ridiculous because we don't want them.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.720]   We have to pay for them.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   Steven Levitan, the creator of Modern Family, has been out there rather truglet-dite-ish,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.480]   complaining about being on Hulu even.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   Oh, really?
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   I can't stand.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   I love the show and I can't stand him for it.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   You know, I want to--
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   He's old school.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   Barry.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.840]   He's been around the TV world a long time.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.320]   I wouldn't expect him to have that modern point of view even though the show's modern
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   family.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.360]   My prediction for Google TV is that it's going to be kind of the nerd's choice of
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   media center.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   It's going to be super hackable.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.120]   You're going to be able to install an app and get your bit torrent feeds set up instantly.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.920]   And you're going to be able to watch, you know, any--
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   So we're nowhere.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.760]   We're basically no advantage at all.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.760]   This is probably what happened.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.440]   Apple took a look, thought about it, said, "There's no hurry.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.920]   We can continue on as we have.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.680]   Let's just slowly enter this market and do it right rather than rush and try to beat
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.880]   Google at the game because Google isn't going to get promoted.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   Wow, that was right.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.640]   Well, it is iOS.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   It is an A4.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   They could-- remember, the iPhone didn't come out with apps at first.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   They could.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   Okay.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   All right.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.680]   Next year, they could-- next month, they could-- the firmware upgrade put more on it.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.400]   They probably-- I have a feeling that there was a little time pressure from Apple's point
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.600]   of view because the deals weren't falling into place for content.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.160]   You know, they got Disney and barely got Fox through Rupert Murdoch.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.760]   It was apparently a tough negotiation.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.600]   So I think that they felt like, "Well, we don't have the deals in place.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   There's no hurry."
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   Google's going to flop.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.360]   Google's going to fumble this.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.320]   We don't have to worry.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.680]   Roku is our competition.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.880]   Ah, take your time.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.880]   That's probably what happened.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   All right.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.040]   Enough about Apple.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.680]   Who cares?
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.800]   Apparently, Google's got a big problem with a brain drain.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.120]   According to an article in TechCrunch, people are leaving Google for a little bit of time.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.960]   For Facebook-- it's not the only company, by the way, losing people to Facebook.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.720]   I think as it happens, always in Silicon Valley, there's an ebb and flow depending on whose
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.080]   stock is perceived as being more valuable.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.560]   Of course, Facebook's not public yet, but if they're offering big options in an IPO down
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.000]   the road, that might be much more valuable than the Google stock, which is already pretty
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   high.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.880]   And the TechCrunch post gives the example of somebody who was offered a huge raise and
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.480]   a $500,000 stain bonus and still left.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   That's because Facebook has Zuckerbucks.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.480]   Those are valuable.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.920]   1 million Zuckerbucks.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.480]   All the wood chips you can burn.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   Yeah, baby.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   Look at that.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.480]   Actually, he looks pretty good on a dollar bill.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   That's what that aluminum--
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.880]   Well, in relation to that, there's a story up there that Facebook is going to sell gift
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.840]   cards for virtual currency at Target.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   Target.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.160]   Not for anything real.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   But Facebook--
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.560]   Facebook bucks.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.080]   Buy this card with this made up currency to buy made up things.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   You know how well that's going to do now?
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   It's not Zingadolors, right?
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   So what could--
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   Facebook stopped selling the virtual goods, so what is it that Facebook sells now?
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   But don't they start--
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   They used to have you could buy a fake-- an image of a gift basket for a buck.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   And a Gina, congratulations on your birthday.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.760]   And I give you an image, and it costs me real money.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   But I think they stopped giving you that.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.200]   But I know that it cost you real money, so it touches me even more.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   Oh, it's--
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   That's what it is.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.640]   It's the Zuckerbucks account.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.440]   Social games are going to be played by free.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   So--
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   Oh, so it is Zinga.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   Zinga?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.640]   You can go to 7/11, you know, and get Zingadolors right now.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   Oh, you can now?
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   Really?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.920]   They even have Farmville-- they have like a Farmville coffee cup.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.640]   They have all this crap.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.440]   Zinga's way ahead of Facebook on this one.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   And you know what?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.040]   It pains me to admit it, but I think that this is brilliant because think about-- okay,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.160]   your mom-- let's say your mom-- I know somebody whose mom plays Farmville all the time.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.560]   Not my mom, but another person whose mom plays Farmville all the time.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.240]   She would love a gift card says, "Look, you could buy a pony."
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.760]   It costs me $10.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.880]   Makes her happy.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   It's brilliant.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.800]   And the truth is, what is the production cost of a virtual pony?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Zero.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.280]   It's all profit.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   Yep.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   This is a bigger scam than the state lottery.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It really is.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.280]   This is the fall of the Roman Empire, folks.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.360]   Just think if we actually-- I saw an article-- I didn't put it in our feed, but there was
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.480]   an article on Wired about how much time people actually spend in these virtual games and
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.080]   I think that one of the games-- I think it's the one I play.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.680]   We rule something like 2.2 billion hours of farming.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   If people actually farmed for 2.2 billion hours, we'd be in great shape.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.480]   If they did anything real for 2.2 billion hours, we'd have some real asset.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.680]   You know, we'd do a real surplus.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.280]   I comfort myself with thoughts of Wikipedia and open source projects when I think about
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   that.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   Sure.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.040]   Like, there are some people who, you know, it means lots of ways to spend your time.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.680]   Some people do it gaming, which is just entertainment and other people do it editing Wikipedia.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   Gaming dig.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   That's the point of play shorties.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   Well, I know.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.400]   I think the cognitive surplus, we got to wonder a little bit.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   Maybe there ain't such a cognitive surplus.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   Clay says--
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.120]   One that's a question of how we choose to use it.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.360]   Yes, we have a surplus, but we choose to use it by in fake cows.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   Yep.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.600]   What a world, what a world.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   I finally--
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.080]   Sue Gardner for Wikimedia-- the chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.440]   And they just finished a year-long strategy effort, which is a--
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   Frightening to think of.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.480]   You got to headache thinking about Wikipedia and collaborating on strategy.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.640]   But it seems to have worked pretty well.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.800]   A thousand Wikipedia and 26,000 pages.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.000]   Some very good ideas there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.400]   And they want to increase the diversity of people contributing in a place like the
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   US.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.440]   And they want to increase the reach in places like India.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.000]   And it's really fascinating to see the value that's created, the value of Facebook's been
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.800]   estimated at $5 billion.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Wow.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.960]   They say that by calculating just the time put in editing-- I've said this before in the
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   show, but never used the figure.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.280]   No, I can.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.360]   That they ascribe a low per hour labor of value to the edits.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.520]   And it adds up to $700 million a year of effort.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.000]   Oh, isn't that amazing?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It's incredible.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   That's Clay's point.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.400]   That's where the creativity and the cognitive surplus go.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:45.280]   I also saw Beth Novick, who's the head of the Obama Transparent Government Initiative.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.600]   And was talking about how you can harness that kind of effort for government.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.560]   And her example, which I liked, was that the Social Security site needs to be translated
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.520]   into languages and probably needs to be translated in English too.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.360]   That's something that we could do out here.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.480]   You could use Wikipedia, Wiki software, and we could just take these to functions on and
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   do them.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.400]   And you wonder, what does it need to make that happen?
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   Well, this is kind of-- yeah, the government 2.0 special we did last Friday.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.280]   You need a community catalyst, right?
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.640]   You need someone who's create that platform and then a good leader that kind of bring people
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.840]   in and track people.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.240]   Right now, the open source software that I developed, ThinkUp, which the White House
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.920]   uses, our community is just on fire, the mailing list actually has been rocking today.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   We're having this great discussion about.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.040]   But so much has happened and so many people have contributed in it.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.200]   It's so cool to see folks just volunteer their time because they're interested and they want
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.800]   to use this thing and they have great ideas.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.520]   And when you put people kind of with the same interests and smarts and experience in a room,
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   it's amazing what happens.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.840]   I mean, I've been doing this for years.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.800]   My whole career has been based on crowdsourcing.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.080]   Life hacker was just me and the wheel with a bunch of people just pushing me with tips
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.160]   and comments and links.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.880]   So I've been doing this for a long time, but I'm still amazed at the magic that can happen
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.760]   when you get the right people together to collaborate.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.320]   So it's just a matter of creating that platform and then having the leader, having the Linus
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.400]   Torvolds to kind of inspire people and to shepherd them along and give them the virtual
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.640]   cookie and encouragement and all that.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.080]   The community management I think is the real skill.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.600]   I think we can accept that people are always going to waste time.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   That's normal.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.760]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.080]   People have to have leisure, but what's great.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.840]   I think Apple fanboys are saying we're doing that right now.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.400]   That's great.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.160]   That you can also put the same energies into something else.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   Maybe both.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.320]   Maybe you spend some time in Farmville and sometime on an open source project.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.720]   I think it's the same kind of thing.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.360]   The tools are there to get that done.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.880]   People are always going to waste time, but there is an opportunity now to do this kind
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.760]   of thing and I think that's great.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:56.000]   The partner article, the article that we were just talking about about the brain drain is
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.720]   from the San Francisco Chronicles website, the SFGate Facebook, working hard to avoid
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.400]   Google's fate.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.440]   Interesting idea.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.200]   The premise of which is that despite the fact that Google does very, very well, all
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:18.800]   of its money, 95% of it comes off of search and search growth revenue is very slowing.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.560]   You're not going to have the kind of growth.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   By the way, the stock market loves growth and the multiples of growth.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.640]   They don't care if you're profitable.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.280]   You got to grow and grow fast, which is why Google's stock price is starting to tank,
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.080]   why Google's losing talent to Facebook.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.560]   The ex-Googlers, according to this article, I don't should give credit to Nicholas Carlson.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.000]   Actually, it's from the Business Insider, Gates republishing it.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.620]   Nicholas Carlson running the Business Insider says, "The ex-Googlers running Facebook starting
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.880]   with COO Sheryl Sandberg are determined to avoid turning Facebook into a one-trick pony,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.960]   relying on a single revenue stream."
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   Among things that they're doing are search ads, the like buttons give them a hierarchy
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.840]   of web pages, much like page rank, but also Facebook credits in games, which you could
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.400]   sell in Target.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.560]   Pay with Facebook on third-party commerce sites, a PayPal play.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.560]   Amazon's done that quite well.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   Google's doing that.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.300]   I see Google check out on a lot of sites.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:26.260]   Local coupons with the places feature, it's kind of like Groupon, where you can have coupons
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.860]   that are tied to your location.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.580]   Brand advertising, of course, you're going to sell display ads.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:37.460]   By the way, those ads are doing quite well for Facebook.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.840]   Off Facebook, brand advertising, because people use Facebook Connect to log in, you could
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.180]   tie in that way too and make some money there too.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   Interesting article.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   It does make a lot of sense.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.180]   Facebook has a lot of ways to go.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.180]   Do you think Google's in trouble?
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.360]   Do you think Google needs to?
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.060]   They certainly are obviously looking for additional revenue streams.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.900]   When you did your research for the book, what would Google do, Jeff?
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.860]   Was this thinking going on inside Google?
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.220]   I don't really know.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.540]   The questions they asked me after the book came out were more about their PR, but those
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.300]   are PR people, which I think is an issue.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   It is an issue.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   Facebook?
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.820]   I think that Eric Schmidt has said, "We get 90-some percent of our revenue from advertising.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.900]   We love advertising, period."
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.220]   He also says the board is pushing for more diversity of revenue streams and they don't
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.340]   really have it.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.980]   I would never write them off.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:39.860]   I think that their big strategy is mobile going forward and there's a lot of growth
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.420]   to be had there.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:48.740]   The problem is that in each one of these new media, the revenue goes down.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.140]   Mobile's not a good advertising platform.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.300]   It'll be better.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   It's much better with maps.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.700]   I'm using the voice control of maps and things like that.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.500]   I think there's a lot of potential there, but that's very hard to sell.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.060]   You need to scale that, which is hard and expensive.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.620]   There's growth there, but it's hard growth.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.300]   I think the problem that Google has always said, which Schmidt has said, this is what
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.380]   I said, what has been said to me, is the problem is the company becomes too big.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:25.020]   I think that Wave and, sorry, Gina, and Buzz, and these efforts are the problem of size.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.300]   Well, you don't know where to ... It's difficult.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.620]   You want to have diversity and a lot of ideas and try a lot of things out, but if you do
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.580]   that, it's hard to throw all your weight behind it.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:41.340]   We see this happen with Google, are tossed out, tossed to the wind and with no support,
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.980]   and they just ... They're just like Wave.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.220]   I heard that the Wave team was structured.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.660]   Wave was more like an acquisition than it was internal project.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.020]   I think that Lars and his team, Non-Sydney, were treated like a separate startup, separate
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.140]   from the main company, and that they had certain goals to meet within a year, and they just
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   didn't need them.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   Oh, interesting.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.140]   Oh, interesting.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.780]   I think they were a little bit ... The understanding was that if they didn't meet their goals,
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.460]   then they just weren't going to get the ... It just wasn't going to keep going.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.740]   I think Wave was structured a little differently, especially just location.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.380]   They were on the other side of the world, and I definitely got a sense that there was
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.700]   some disconnection with the rest of the company when I talked to the Wave team at I/O.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:29.260]   I think that was a special situation, but I think this ... Android versus Chrome OS and
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.180]   Buzz and a lot of other products that started up and didn't go anywhere side-wicking all
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.740]   these little things here and there that we all forgot about do indicate that there's
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.340]   definitely fracturing, fragmenting.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.580]   They damaged Google a little bit, because you don't get the network effect.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.660]   You don't get people jumping on board unless you feel ... Google does a Google Me, and
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:53.820]   I have to say this as a Google fanboy, at this point, I'm going to stand back and watch.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.500]   A lot of people feel that way.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:04.180]   The irony is that they were the brilliant ones at the beta and at labs.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.180]   I don't know what it is.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.100]   They just got cocky or something, and it changed the structure so that no, we have to release
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.380]   Buzz as a done product without the beta.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.100]   If Google just said, "Hey, we're trying some stuff out.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.580]   It may work, it may not," we all get that.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.660]   Things don't make it out of labs.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.660]   Okay.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:28.180]   Google, I think, does hurt themselves when they say, "We're behind this and they're not."
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.180]   You listen to Dodgeball, Dennis Crowley.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.940]   It was obviously an unpleasant experience.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.540]   He had the same across the world problem.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.300]   He was in New York.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.500]   They could have had Four Square.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:44.060]   They could have had a real jump on Facebook and a real jump on Apple and local.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.220]   They blew it.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.620]   That's to me one of the worst mistakes they've made.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.900]   They obviously don't know how to acquire companies.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.300]   Gina, I think you've got a point about that and I think these two are parallel stories,
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.660]   then.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.900]   One monetization path, YouTube, may be starting pay-per-view movies.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.940]   This rumor from Financial Times says that Google will launch the service first in the
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.860]   United States but is in talks with studios worldwide.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:18.260]   That's what Apple's doing, isn't it, with their new iTunes streaming store.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:24.420]   It was interesting, Steve's speech today, there were a couple of shots at Google.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:30.740]   Shot one early on was Steve said, "Well, somebody's mentioning how many activations
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.740]   they have a day.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.740]   Did you know we have 230,000 activations a day?"
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.460]   That doesn't include upgrades, which those other guys are counting.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.100]   We have no idea where these numbers come from or anything, but he was very clear that we're
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.620]   growing faster than Android if you include all iOS devices."
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.820]   That was clearly a shot at Google.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.580]   He mentioned YouTube several times as being cheesy.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.340]   He didn't say, "We've got YouTube on the Apple TV," but earlier he said, "People want
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.980]   Hollywood content.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   They want--
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   Amateur hour.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.980]   Amateur hour was the phrase.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.980]   Amateur hour.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.620]   I wonder if he's ever watched some of the great web video that goes on.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.260]   I wonder if he's ever watched the killer.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.460]   That pisses me off because he's the one who enabled amateur hour.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.660]   It's his tools that we use to make this amateur crap.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   Exactly.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.340]   It's our fault that we make it all.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.340]   Good point.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.860]   That's a very good point.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.140]   He did the same thing with podcasting.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.380]   He really deprecated podcasting before Apple put podcasting into iTunes.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.580]   He said basically the same thing.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.580]   It was amateur hour.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.420]   Amateur hour is definitely the most offensive thing that was said in the whole time.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   That came to YouTube.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   And that came to YouTube.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   Big stuff.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.020]   Steve, you wouldn't be selling Final Cut.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.060]   You'd be selling a lot fewer copies of it.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.060]   So Google--
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.260]   I like to Jeff starts grinding.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.540]   I know I do too.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.100]   I like that face he makes out of here.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.180]   I haven't even had any Cabernet yet.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.060]   You just wait.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:02.460]   So I think we are-- we're continuing with this Apple versus Google thing.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   Steve was not as aggressive about it as Google was at Google I/O.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.580]   But it's clear that they still see each other as a budding heads over some things.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:19.460]   And this YouTube as a streaming paid service is an interesting play against Apple.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.060]   Is Facebook going to enter this phrase?
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.060]   Interesting.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   They could, right?
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.660]   Of all-- I'll tell you, of all the people who know how to scale, Facebook seems the best
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.220]   at this.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.420]   It's unbelievable the amount of traffic they serve with relatively few slow downs or
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.420]   pick-ups.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.500]   Was it your point-- somebody made a smart point.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.740]   Of course, I assume all smart points are for one of you that I heard recently that the
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:48.460]   reason that Facebook-- one of the great keys to Facebook's growth and success was that
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.860]   it could meet her in scaling because it first was only Harvard, only Ivy League, only college.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   Right.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.020]   That wasn't me, but you're absolutely right.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.380]   Yep.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.180]   And so they were able to scale bit by bit.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:09.460]   And by the way, it had a secondary benefit, created demand because, oh, I want to get
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460]   in there.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.460]   It's very exclusive.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.740]   You go from the exclusive, more exclusive to less exclusive, you create demand all along
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   the way.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.860]   It's too late now.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.500]   Everybody's got it.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   And Gmail did that, right?
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.140]   They were invited for a long time.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140]   Yes.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   Very smart.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.620]   The point about having all these products kind of throwing stuff up against the wall and
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.620]   see what sticks.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.340]   And we have to remember that Gmail was a 20% project, right?
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.820]   So with every 20% project, there's a possibility that it'll become Gmail, right, which is such
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.980]   a successful product.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.300]   So successful, they keep adding stuff to it, right?
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.260]   So that's a good reason you can kind of understand it a little bit.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.540]   But you know, for at least one success, you know, you're going to find failures.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.540]   Sorry about that.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.940]   No, I think you're very, very right.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.300]   I think that-- but isn't there a bit of a difference though in the way that they launched
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   Gmail?
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.300]   Oh, let's see what we think of this.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   It's a beta.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   We'll not let you in.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.540]   You know, we're trying this out versus how they launched Wave and Buzz.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.540]   Definitely.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   That's a problem.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.340]   Yeah, Gmail was way more finished when it launched, even an invitational in a beta than
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.340]   Wave.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.340]   All the Gmail was obvious what it was.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   Exactly.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.980]   It was more finished yet more humble.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   Right.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.980]   Say perfect combination.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.220]   Finished and humble.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   Yes.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.260]   Versus unfinished and overweening.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.900]   And I think you have to say that about Wave.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.500]   When you say we're going to replace email.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.820]   And then people try-- that's a big mistake marketing-wise.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.820]   They aimed you high.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.820]   They aimed you high.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.820]   That was Wave's problem.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.820]   They just aimed you high.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:40.100]   Too high, too much too fast with nothing that actually, you know, didn't work the way
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   it needed to work.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   You know what?
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:49.180]   I have to say one thing that this whole conversation encourages me is this stuff is really hard.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:55.580]   And that's good because it means no one company, not Microsoft, not IBM, not Apple, not Google,
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.020]   can just march in and say, or Facebook can march in and say, we got it, we'll take it
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.380]   from here and dominate forever.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.220]   They can do it for a while.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.860]   But this stuff is really hard.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.660]   And at some point somebody's smarter and faster and better and is going to come along
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.780]   and you're going to have to step aside.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.900]   What's happening is it's happening faster and faster.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.260]   I'll tell you, three years ago, it seemed like, well Google, there's no way anybody could
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.500]   ever beat Google because they have the index.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.020]   You know, and it's true, nobody could beat them at search.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.260]   It's just that search isn't the end game.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.260]   There is no game.
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.180]   There's the next thing in the next thing in the next.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.860]   Are you using Facebook places guys?
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.860]   I am.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   I had to re up.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   I know.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   Embarrassingly enough.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.060]   It's like me buying an iPad.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   Did you?
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.060]   No.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.060]   My wife.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.740]   Oh, what was one of my students in my entrepreneurial journals and class has a business going to be basically
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.700]   the iPad and so I tried to the problem and said, well, you know, I've been waiting for
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.020]   the thing that makes me have to eat, grow and get it.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.220]   She said, you are not getting it.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.940]   You wish that money on the read stocking fee.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.020]   You are not doing it.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   Well, Jeff and I did the thing, the YouTube I give up on this thing, which is always a
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.220]   mistake because it never goes away.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.260]   So yeah, no, I actually was places that got me back on Facebook because I really needed
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.860]   to understand the privacy implications.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.900]   I had a dummy account that I had created last month just to see what the default privacy
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.900]   settings were.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.260]   And then I realized that I can't do places unless I have friends because I have to see
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.820]   what the check ins look like.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.180]   I have to see how people check me.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.140]   And so yeah, I'm basically back on.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.060]   Oh, Gina, are you a leader of four square fan?
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.220]   Are you using places?
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.580]   I'm not using Facebook places.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.460]   I don't trust Facebook enough to with my location data.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.260]   I'm still using four square and I really, really like it.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.500]   And there's just something about four square.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   I know it's this kind of plucky New York company.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.980]   And I don't know.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.940]   I have this trust in them because I just think that they're good at it.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.020]   But now I disabled it day one.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.580]   I was like, I'm turning this off right now.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.220]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.340]   You know, if you check in with four square or scavenger or a lot of other places, you
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   could tie it to Facebook.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.340]   So it doesn't really matter.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.460]   You can still check in if you choose.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.980]   This is the interesting thing about places.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:15.180]   So here I'm checking in a Twit cottage, but these are other people at Twit cottage who
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.500]   are Facebook friends of mine.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.380]   I can add them to the check in.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.380]   Oh boy.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.140]   So, you know, I could tag the friends who are with me and check them in.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.900]   Now they have to set a privacy setting that says you can't do that.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.580]   And you have to set that, right?
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.580]   That's not the default.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.460]   Well, you know, this is the other thing with Facebook.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.020]   It's not clear what the default is.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.020]   It's not clear what the default is.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.580]   I could check all these people.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.900]   You know, anybody don't want to in any time, but I will check in the people that that I
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.500]   know are here.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.740]   My CEO, Lisa Kensel and Tom Merritt.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.740]   I know he's here.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.740]   Good thing is they work for you.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.740]   So what are they going to say?
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   Yeah, they can't stop.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.740]   Hey, go ahead.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.620]   Try a good blame.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.780]   And actually I should uncheck Darren Kitchen.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.060]   He's not here today.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:04.020]   And then when I'm done, it's now going to check me in with those two people.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:10.500]   And if they haven't said anything about it, I've just announced to the world that they're
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.500]   here, which is kind of that's kind of an interesting.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   For what it's worth, I don't use Google attitude either.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   So.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.740]   It's worth latitude.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:28.140]   If you look at my Google chat status message, it's got my exact location all the time as
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.980]   I travel around.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.460]   People always know where I am.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460]   And that's kind of the default.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.460]   You don't really get anything bad.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.380]   The Zuckerberg said to me that the problem with latitude is you don't get anything back
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   for that.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   You don't.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.380]   Right.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.380]   But I mean, come on.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.380]   What do I get back for four square places?
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.300]   I get, you know, if I check into my health club, it says you get a free three day guest
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.300]   pass.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   That's true.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.300]   All your daughter get when it comes to college and seeing friends.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   Well there you go.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.300]   And latitude does this.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.140]   I can go to maps and I can see who's nearby on latitude if they're my latitude friends.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.100]   So you get that from latitude.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.020]   In fact, it's kind of a nice way.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.380]   Everybody's got, you know, Google maps.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.380]   It's kind of cool.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.380]   If you turn on the latitude background.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.580]   You get who's near you.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.580]   You get who's near you.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.580]   I haven't seen that.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   Yeah, that's kind of nice.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.580]   Yeah, that which Facebook oddly doesn't do.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.580]   Okay.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.860]   So yeah, the coupons and so forth, you don't get from latitude, but you get the location
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   information.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.220]   By the way, yes, I can make latitude citywide, which I do.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.580]   I don't, I don't tell you my home address.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.500]   Leo, what happened to Buzz?
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.860]   I feel bad because I really like Buzz and I like the Buzz team and they're very cooperative,
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.860]   but I'm scared.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   I got bit by Buzz.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.420]   So if this happened during Twitter on Sunday, it was very weird.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.180]   I had Buzz connected to dig.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.500]   Ben Rose was sitting across from me when this happened.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:54.180]   I had Buzz connected to dig so that, you know, the new dig, and by the way, this turns out
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.020]   to be one of the things people at dig hate, the diggers hate, the new dig lets publishers
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.220]   pump feeds in there.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.740]   So Mashable pumps every story, just as they do, by the way, at Buzz.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.340]   I, when Kevin asked me to be part of the beta, they said, what feeds do you want to pump
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   in?
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.500]   I said, well, I'll put in the, all the Twitch shows, my Buzz feed and my delicious feed.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.740]   And then now that it went public, people said, Leah spamming as with all these links, though
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.740]   I took everything off and just delicious.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:24.580]   But for a while, everything I buzzed was pumped into dig as a dug item.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.420]   But it was one way.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.220]   Sunday, now dig four has all sorts of bugs and problems.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:35.260]   They put a new whole new system up and it's really messy and breaks a lot and so forth.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:42.380]   And somehow Sunday, my dig RSS feed changed from stuff that I've dug to everything on
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.420]   the front page, hundreds of stories I've never even seen about Paris Hilton and all sorts
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.740]   of crap, nothing that I ever dug or saw or anything.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:56.140]   And this is what I think had to have been a Google Buzz bug established a reverse direction
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.780]   connection into Buzz.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.260]   Oh.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:05.020]   So suddenly hundreds of stories that I had nothing to do with from the front page of
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.460]   dig or pumped into buzz.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.980]   And I have buzz can tweet turned on.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.420]   So then from buzz it pumped into anybody who saw my Twitter feed and I'm all of a sudden
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.620]   getting these tweets like nuclear reaction was it was a meltdown.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.620]   It was.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.180]   This is the total meltdown.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.500]   I don't know how I missed this.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.460]   I guess I was on Twitter this weekend.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.900]   Did you clean out your Twitter feed?
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   So what happens?
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.500]   I get started getting on the air doing twins.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   So I couldn't have done this by the way.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.580]   I have an alibi and Kevin's sitting right there.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.340]   So I said, okay, what have I?
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.460]   And so I went into buzz and I immediately turned off.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.020]   I said, well, how did it get pumped to become my connected site?
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.540]   So I turned that off.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.260]   It turned it back and saved it and turned it back on again.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.260]   So buzz something.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.860]   There's a bug in buzz that allowed a third party to change the settings that I had given
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   buzz.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.940]   That's a big bug.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.940]   That's a big bug.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.780]   Have you talked to buzz the buzz folks about that?
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.780]   No, I just quit.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.780]   No.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.860]   Because it was the second big bug in literally three days.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:10.980]   And I was like, okay, I'll wait till you figure this out because I don't really need buzz.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.980]   And so I went on Twitter.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   I said, I'm really sorry.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   I don't know what happened.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.580]   I deleted all those messages.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.820]   I went into buzz.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:21.020]   Now, if you go to buzz and you say disconnect buzz, it says warning, you're going to delete
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.660]   your Google profile, your Google account and all your buzzes.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.620]   I said, no, no, I don't want to do that.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.220]   I mean, they really scared me.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.700]   They said, oh, you really wanted to delete your Google account.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.420]   So you have to go in and there's a different setting which says, oh, just.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.100]   I don't want to see buzz in my Gmail.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.420]   And then I went into buzz manually and took out all the connections.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.580]   So there's nothing coming into buzz.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.860]   I also went to dig, took out all the connections there.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.780]   I mean, I do, I mean, this was a mess.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.780]   Wow.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.780]   This is fascinating.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.780]   This is the danger.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.460]   One hand, I want these things to connect, right?
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.860]   I want my Apple social and my Facebook social and my four square social to connect.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.260]   But this is the nightmare.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.260]   Right.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.220]   I mean, look, I don't like auto publishing, but it just made sense that buzz should go
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.220]   to Twitter.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.220]   If I'm going to spend all my time in buzz that should go to Twitter so that people can
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.020]   see what I'm talking about.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.780]   And it made sense briefly for buzz to go into dig.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.420]   I did realize that's really not the aesthetic of dig.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.260]   Dig is kind of you curate.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.820]   So I do have delicious going to dig because those are articles that I pick.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.300]   So there would be articles I would dig except I don't want to both delicious and dig.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.460]   And that's that's why you connect accounts, right?
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.420]   Same kind of content, but you don't want to have to do it twice.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.060]   So it seems like that's okay to me.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.700]   Look, I'm not gone from buzz forever if they figure this out.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   They figure it out.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.420]   But you know what the side effect of this is?
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.500]   And I have to think other people have the same reaction is I'm going to be very suspicious
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.180]   of a Google me because geez, I don't want to have that happen again.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.060]   So between the privacy issues, they had the beginning of buzz.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.140]   The buzz deleted me bug that happened to me.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:58.660]   And now the buzz making connections to third party sites I didn't approve of.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.660]   Do you blame me?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.900]   No, it's understandable.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.900]   It's understandable.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.300]   If people say you're such a drama queen Leo.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.540]   I guess I am.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.540]   Except that broadcasting is your business.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.980]   These are the tools that you're using to do it.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.540]   I was watching my Twitter follower count physically go down.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.660]   I lost hundreds and hundreds of followers.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:26.660]   If you were Comcast or Best Buy and this happened, you'd suffer real economic damage.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   Well, I certainly suffered reputation damage.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.660]   I can't tell you how many tweets I've got.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.660]   You're nice and cuddly people like you.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.180]   A lot of people went from liking me to not liking me.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.180]   That's really what hurt.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.660]   I got a lot of tweets saying, Leo, you jerk, you spamming us.
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.660]   What a nitty.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.180]   I got a lot of a preparation.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.460]   And that actually was what finally did it because I don't like people not like me.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.300]   It hurts my feeling.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.220]   So you need to be more like Steve Jobs.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.780]   Well, you know, it goes with the game, of course.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.100]   I get hate mail every day.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.300]   It's not that you're not going to hate mail.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.380]   But I just didn't want it wasn't something I did.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.140]   I don't mind getting hate mail for things I do.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.020]   But in this case, I had no control over it.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.380]   I was a victim.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.140]   So anyway, that's what that's all about.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.460]   And I apologize to members of the Buzz team because they've been very nice.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.940]   I like them and I like Buzz.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.260]   I wish there were something I could use.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.900]   You were the greatest booster.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.460]   Oh, now you make me feel terrible.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.020]   No, don't, Leo, don't feel bad.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.860]   I completely understand now.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.860]   That's pretty.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.860]   At the time it felt bad.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.860]   That's bad.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.180]   And like the whole read write thing where like something's writing back to something.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.180]   That shouldn't happen.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.020]   That's not scary stuff.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.260]   And if that could happen, I mean, you know, what if it discovered my porn accounts?
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.260]   I mean, deep trouble.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.260]   Exactly.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.260]   Exactly.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.180]   So Google bought social deck.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:55.820]   And this is a company from Canada, Waterloo, Ontario, that is the maker of social games
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.380]   for mobile phones.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.860]   They've bought, they're doing, they're on an acquisition tear, aren't they?
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:07.260]   They bought, they got this company, was it Angstro?
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.700]   That it looks like they really were trying to get the guy behind Angstro.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.260]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.180]   Am I, let me see if I can find that article.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:24.700]   There was another article in there about their new focus on acquisitions.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:30.380]   So what, can we put this together and make some sort of coherent narrative around this?
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.220]   Is this all about building Google me?
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.020]   Is this the way to do social socials games?
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.740]   I can't imagine that Google's not exactly a game brand.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:47.540]   It's always a difficult because you don't know if they're buying the brains and not
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.700]   the intellectual property.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.180]   Yeah, Angstro on the 30th.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.820]   So that was a couple of days ago and social deck.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   I thought word was that social deck was about social gaming for their mobile.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.740]   So like being able to game via Android.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.540]   Are they going to do what Apple's doing with their own game center?
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.580]   Yeah, I thought that was one of the articles that we linked in the front feed.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.580]   Yeah, that is.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.580]   That's it.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:21.460]   And then Angstro, I did find the article, Angstro looks very much like a Google me.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:28.020]   It's a Dr. Rohit car, a software engineer with two decades of technical and standards
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:33.900]   experience at MCI, the worldwide Web Consortium.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.580]   No now, commerce net.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:43.220]   And it was actually Yahoo's in-house incubator.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.460]   This may be about the talent.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:50.420]   Yeah, this was certainly a talent buy.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:56.620]   In fact, he wrote an article in December that's called for a tech crunch called privacy theater
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.820]   why social networks only pretend to protect you.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   Ooh.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.460]   That sounds very salacious.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.740]   So they're clearly building a brain trust of something.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.820]   Now maybe it's just, you know, and they got Max Lechten from Slide.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.020]   I have to think this is all around Google me.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.900]   This paid content had a piece in which they quote analyst, Sun Deep Agarwal saying that
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.740]   the purchases are more defensive and they will chart there, which ones are offensive
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.300]   and defensive.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:36.580]   And arguing that they're aiming and not only increasing their own revenue, but it hurting
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580]   competitors.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.580]   That's why it's.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   That makes sense.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.420]   And if you've got a brain drain and there's a brain out there, you get it.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:47.100]   You don't waste time letting brains go.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.860]   Well, the big Google story and we're going to get to it in just a moment, of course,
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.500]   and we're glad to know that Gina actually has this is the new priority inbox.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.500]   Gina.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.540]   And we're so mad at you, Gina, that you have it.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:03.900]   I finally just got the voice chat, you know, the phone calls inside the Google chat.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.380]   So we'll talk about priority inbox in just a second before we do though.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:12.620]   I want to mention our friends at Citrix who do go to meeting the best way to meet online,
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:18.140]   go to meeting builds on that great Citrix backbone and remote access to let you hold
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.020]   meetings anywhere in the world with up to 15 attendees.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.820]   You can show them what's on your computer.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.020]   They can take control show you what's on their computer.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   It is both a time saver and a meeting galvanizer.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.980]   I mean, after all, let's face a conference calls, which are really pretty much how people
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.660]   do these things are boring and it's very difficult to keep them on track, keep them productive.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.380]   As soon as you've got visuals, which you have with go to meeting, everybody's on the same
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.540]   page.
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.540]   They could see your screen.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.700]   They follow along with you.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.540]   They're more focused, more interested, more engaged.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.700]   And that means you're more productive.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.700]   You save time.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.820]   There's even an iPad app, which I think is so fantastic for sales presentations, product
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:59.260]   demos, training sessions, collaboration, weekly update calls, just about any kind of
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   conference call you're making now.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   It'd be so much.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.580]   Just imagine how much better it would be with go to meeting.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.740]   Well, you don't have to imagine you could try it free right now for 30 days, 30 days, unlimited
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:14.540]   meetings, as many meetings as you want, as long as you want, go to go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.540]   That's all you have to do.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.980]   And you can sign up for 30 days absolutely free.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.740]   I think you're going to like it though.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.740]   So I should warn you, don't try this unless you're willing to buy it because you are going
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   to get hooked.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.460]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.060]   We thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.780]   So Google has been busy with the rollouts.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.060]   You know, first this free phones, I think we talked about that last week.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.500]   And finally I got it.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.660]   Jeff, do you have it yet?
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.660]   The free phone.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   All my apps account.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.660]   I have it only in my regular TV account.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.780]   Yeah, you won't get it in your apps account, right?
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.780]   Jeanette?
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   No.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.780]   No, you will actually.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.780]   I do have it.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:50.780]   You have it in your apps?
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.780]   I have it in my apps account.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.620]   There is a setting in your apps account, Jeff.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.620]   I think I tweeted it.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.820]   You have to opt in to pre-release features early.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:03.300]   So if you check that box and say I want new stuff early, then you'll get stuff faster.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.340]   I don't know what the overall schedule for the Google Apps roll app, but I definitely
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.380]   have a call phone in my apps account right now.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.660]   That's great because initially they said that we're not going to, it's not enterprise
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.740]   ready, we're not going to put it in apps.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.740]   So that's good.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   You just have to say I know it's not enterprise.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.540]   Do you have any idea where?
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.540]   You do that?
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.540]   It's kind of buried in this.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   You have to go into manage this domain and let's see if I can find this.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.260]   It's kind of buried in one of these.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.300]   All right, I don't mean to take a raise time with this.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.140]   Well, no, I bet you there are people out there who didn't know this.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.140]   I didn't know it.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   I'm about to do it myself.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:39.420]   So we go to manage this domain and then I believe it's domain settings.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.620]   And then if you scroll down, it says automatically add new services and they become available.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.780]   Check that box.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.100]   And then there's a check box that reads enable pre-release features.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.940]   Certain features launched to consumer users are held back by default from Google Apps
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.060]   until they're more mature.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.940]   If you select this option, these pre-release features will be enabled for your users.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.980]   How did you find that, Gina?
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.980]   She's good.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   She's good.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980]   She's good.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   She's a Chilean miner's out.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.420]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   It's kind of buried.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.420]   It is kind of buried.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:14.220]   But listen, I am deeply interested in getting my Gmail features and my default account.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.220]   Do you get buzzed that way too?
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.220]   No.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.220]   Buzz is not an apps.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.220]   Okay.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.220]   It is not an app.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   And I've tried it.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.740]   And you know, the quality is very good.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.500]   It's free calls to anywhere in the US and Canada.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.620]   They say at least through the end of the year, my prediction is they'll keep doing that forever.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.300]   I don't see why they, I mean, it probably doesn't cost them very much.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:36.780]   And it's certainly a great way to get people to start using Gmail and Google chat.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.540]   So now priority inbox.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.940]   And I wish there were a button I could push to make that happen because I'm excited about
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.940]   it.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   Gina, would you describe what this thing does?
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.700]   This is a really cool feature.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:51.820]   When you turn on priority inbox, you get a new inbox in the call priority inbox in the
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.220]   left sidebar.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.420]   Priority inbox looks at your email activity, the people who you email and chat with the
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:02.100]   most and then makes decisions about what are the more important emails.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.020]   So, you know, if Leo emails me, it's going to automatically get marked as important and
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.180]   goes in a priority inbox.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:13.980]   So it introduces these two kind of new labels, not important and important and important stuff
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.980]   goes in a priority inbox.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.740]   So it's like the spam filter except the opposite, you know, bubbles up the emails that are most
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.740]   important.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.340]   So you can mark, you can train it too.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:26.420]   So in fact, just now I'm looking at my priority inbox and I had a message from meetup.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.420]   It's not important, right?
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.780]   So I, you know, check that and said not important and then from there on in, it'll know not
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:35.140]   to put, you know, meet up emails in my priority inbox.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:39.340]   I really like this a lot because it really lets you look at your inbox and instead of
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.940]   just being reverse chronological, you can see here's email from people who I communicate
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:48.100]   with, which is obviously going to be something, you know, that's important.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.140]   And here's the rest of the, you know, the bacon as they call it instead of spam.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.700]   How well does it work?
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.580]   It works pretty well.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.100]   Mine's definitely needed some training.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.460]   So I got it yesterday morning and I've been kind of training thing, training it as it
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.460]   goes.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.020]   It's very satisfying, by the way, to mark messages as not important, especially people
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.460]   you don't like very much.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.660]   You are not important.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.820]   Not important.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.380]   And then, you know, marking things as important.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.540]   So I'm hoping that if the learning, you know, mechanism is good, it's going to be really
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.540]   good.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:20.940]   What strikes me about priority inbox is that this is a really good reason to check your
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.460]   Gmail in the web browser, right?
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.620]   Because these are special labels.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.860]   They don't show up in your, you know, client or on your phone, not yet.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   That's not good.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.860]   This is a really good play.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.700]   Like this is Google saying the web browser is the best place to check your Gmail.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.820]   And I got to tell you, it really is.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.820]   So so I'm digging it.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.140]   I still, you know, your journey is still out.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.580]   It's only been two days, but I've been busy kind of training marking things important
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.580]   and not important.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.580]   And so far I've been really liking it.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.180]   I can't wait to get it.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.980]   Is there any way to force it?
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   Not button you can press.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   Not that I know.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   I'm going to go at the camera.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   I'm going to work that.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:55.980]   I have to say that.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.980]   John's way.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:08.420]   This feature is actually really similar to multiple inboxes, which is a Gmail Labs feature, which
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.780]   just adds a few different lists of messages into your, like a few different inboxes and
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.940]   then you configure each one.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.580]   You say, I want all my starred messages that are on red to appear here.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.380]   So this is just kind of like helping it along, but just adding it as a spam filter, but the
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.700]   other way around an important filter.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.380]   And it's kind of the same technology, I guess, in a way.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.900]   I mean, if you know what spam is and you know what's not spam.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.660]   I would imagine.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.300]   And I think that it probably works really well for folks who use Gmail, you know, don't
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   just forward.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.340]   I think that Gmail needs to know who you actually email.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:44.100]   You know, I think it looks at your sent mail and your chat logs to determine that important.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.900]   So I don't know how well it'll work for you, Leo.
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.140]   I'll be interested to know.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.420]   I can't wait to try it.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.220]   You know, I don't get most of my mail in Gmail, so it's not a great test.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:56.860]   I wish I'm starting to think, you know, we finally got to move the corporate email to
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.980]   Google Apps and I'm starting to think maybe I should get off fast mail, which is a pretty
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   great Gmail.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.380]   Yeah, it is pretty great.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.340]   I'd be interested to see if it was enough for you, Leo, because I'm sure that you do
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.820]   stuff with your email that none of us even want to imagine in our worst moment.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:18.220]   Well, I'll tell you mostly, I use fast mail supports a scripting language called Civ
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.740]   that I use for some pretty heavy processing.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.900]   It's in crazy filters.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.940]   Yeah, it's more than just filters.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.620]   It's all sorts of processing.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:32.140]   You can do things like, well, if it's got more than three CCs and my name is repeated
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:36.820]   more than once, but it comes from one of my, you can do all sorts of clauses.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   That's really nice.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.140]   Yeah, I'm writing those formula.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.780]   Yeah, but I do more than just spam.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.740]   I mean, I'm doing all sorts of folder filtering and things like that.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.340]   I can, you know, it's a good experiment.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.900]   It would be interesting.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:57.380]   A little nerve-wracking, but I might well try it.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:01.260]   You know, this is last summer I got in trouble for saying this to off, but I haven't said
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.860]   it in months.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:08.020]   This approaches Marissa Myers hyper personal news stream.
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:13.260]   And if Google can watch what you read an email and then I can also watch other things
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.780]   you do, that's that should have been buzz.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.260]   What you search for and other things, it can prioritize a lot of life.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.260]   Right.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.860]   And save time as scary as that sounds.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.020]   It saves you time in the end.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.980]   If I answered email from someone who I want to get back to quickly, you know, that otherwise
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.660]   would have just flowed down into my inbox.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.180]   You know, it's neat.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:40.980]   I mean, it's really the first time in years we've seen a new, a new take on email.
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.940]   I mean, you know, email is pretty basic.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.940]   Wave aside.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:44.940]   Wave aside.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.940]   It's a pretty basic functionality.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.780]   And this is a good idea.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.780]   Oh, it's huge.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.780]   It is.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.940]   And Google has the technology to do this, right?
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:56.700]   I mean, if they have all your activity and they have these, you know, sort of awesome
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.620]   engines to classify spam and to rank search results.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:04.340]   I mean, if it's as good as it search results, then, you know, it's going to, it's a really
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.340]   good, it's a really good feature.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.300]   And again, it's going to get people back into the web browser with Gmail.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.140]   I don't think that people, I think that most people love it.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.140]   No, I think so.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:17.220]   I imagine that it will soon be in the cultural market.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.540]   What you just said a bit ago.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.780]   Hey, hey, lay off or I'm going to not important you.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.140]   You are not important.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.460]   Oh, sorry.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.460]   My Gmail mark.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.660]   It was not important.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.660]   It was wrong.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.660]   Did it make a mistake?
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.580]   Oh, I got caught my fan filter.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:36.380]   It was the new caught my fan filter.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   Exactly.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   All right.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.540]   Well, I can't wait to get it.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.820]   It sounds like a really interesting update.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   All right.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:52.940]   Let us, I think go to our wrap this thing up with our tool number and tip of the week
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:58.540]   starting with Gina Trapani from smarter word.org and her tool of the week.
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.140]   I tool the week or my tip of the week.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   Tip of the week.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   I'm a tool.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   You're a tip.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.260]   This one's for aspirational programmers.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.820]   I get people asking me all the time.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.540]   Like, you know, I want to learn how to code and I don't know where to start.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.660]   I think probably most of the people listening to the show are pretty savvy and I've kind
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.180]   of probably played with code a little bit at least.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.180]   But and this was new to me.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.500]   I'm not sure how long it's been around, but it was due to me.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   Google code university.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.060]   If you go to code.google.com/edu, it's got all these free courses on kind of like Googly
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:33.100]   languages and when I say Googly languages, I mean like Python, Java, Go, HTML5, C++.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.020]   And it's a bunch of like free courses and they're geared toward relative beginners.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.260]   So if you're, you know, an auto-dedact, a type that can kind of pick up a book and learn
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:45.700]   something, there's some good, some good syllabi, excuse me here, my Latin teacher with smacme
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.500]   syllabi here and some good tutorials to work through.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:55.020]   Get you to that, get you to that Hello world and some of the more Google friendly languages.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.220]   It seems a little spotty in terms of its coverage.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.900]   I mean, it's you're not going to get thorough coverage, you know, then gender Java, it's
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.620]   got the Java memory model and effective static race detection.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.460]   Yeah, but if you're interested in effective static race detection, you are set, man.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.220]   But if you click on like Android and the in the in the, in the sidebar, on the courses,
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.620]   you click on Android, there's some Android application development, that's that Java
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.620]   for Python.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.700]   And if you know, there's web programming, so you have some Ajax and some Asian.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   Oh, this is great.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700]   Oh, this is really great.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.940]   So yeah, there's some good, there's some good stuff here.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.620]   It's not all hosted at Google.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.620]   Some of it is hosted at all.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.260]   This is Cal Poly, for instance.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.940]   And here's one from North Carolina State.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.940]   So HTML5Rocks.com.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.940]   Wow.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940]   This is great.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.940]   Right.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.780]   So it's a good resource for folks who are just interested in maybe working through a tutorial
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.780]   or two and getting there, they're programming chops.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:50.700]   The CPECSC409 special topics on software engineering at Cal Poly.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.260]   I love it that universities are starting to put this stuff online.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.260]   I think that's just, I mean, amazing.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260]   Oh, good.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.740]   On the way to, I can't remember.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.140]   Did both of you get into the App Inventor?
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   I did.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   Oh, you did?
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   I didn't.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.140]   You did the Hello World.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   That's right.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   Gina, you didn't.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   I did not.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   Well, that's, we thought it was a long time ago.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.780]   I just got in last week.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.780]   I think they're just going out now.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   Have you Hello World yet?
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   No.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.460]   TechCrunch got it like right away, but we, we little minions.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   That's it.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.460]   The shine was gone for Leo.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.460]   He's like, whatever.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460]   Hello this.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.460]   Hello.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.460]   Hello.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.460]   Hello right here.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.460]   No, I'm going to do it.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.460]   I just haven't gotten around to it.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.660]   But see, I'm also playing with, with, with real Android development, but it's so I don't
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.660]   know if I want to kind of start doing something that's that simple, but it's a great idea for
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.900]   Google to do that.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.900]   Absolutely.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.380]   Absolutely.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:45.220]   Your number of the week, well, by the way, we should just repeat that sites.google, I
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:52.420]   mean, sorry, code.google.com/edu for the Google University.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.900]   Your number of the week, Mr. J.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.060]   I'll try to.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:00.900]   Trender says that during the Apple announcement, there were as many as 6,000 tweets a minute.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.900]   Wow.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.820]   Topic of various topics.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:15.540]   And then the other one I love is I just got this today that 61% of Iceland is on Facebook.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.540]   That's it.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.540]   61% of Iceland.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.140]   I was surprised it's not more actually.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.580]   It's that or fishing, you know.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.580]   Oh, no.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:26.140]   Yeah, those Icelanders, when the sun comes out, the clothes go off.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.860]   They're very, they like to make hay while the sun shines.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:34.620]   So I'm not surprised they're actually fairly active on Facebook.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.420]   They're hooking up.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   I like that.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.420]   They're hooking up.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.420]   These plans from the one sun comes out.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.380]   When you get long winners, the hookups become so important.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.300]   It gives, it gives, it gives good people one.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.300]   I have a couple of tools.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.940]   There's a fellow in the chat room been asking over and over again.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.660]   And I realize that we haven't talked much about it.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.500]   You know, if you do get to Froyo and a lot of people are in Froyo now, the incredible,
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   just got Froyo.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.660]   Droy, Droy 2 have Froyo, you know, Android operating system 2.2.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.300]   The way task killers work has changed.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.860]   And in fact, I think it was Google's intent that you not need a task killer in 2.2, that
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.660]   it should just work automatically.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.180]   And they certainly put a lot of underpinnings under there to make, you know, programs that
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.420]   are done go away, not use up resources and so forth.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.460]   It does, you know, occasionally happen.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:28.340]   But yeah, most of the task killers no longer, it's not that they crash or maybe, you know,
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.700]   don't apparently work, but they really aren't doing anything.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.580]   What I've done is I've switched from a task killer, and I mentioned this before, but this
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:43.500]   would be a timely time to re mention it to something called Watchdog, which is probably
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.820]   better for Froyo use.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.700]   What it does is it monitors CPU usage.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.780]   So I have a little widget, the Watchdog widget here, but I'll launch Watchdog.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   And what it's doing is it will warn you, it will actually give you an alert and you have
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.540]   a variety of ways of having that, receiving that alert.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:05.480]   If somebody starts to hog the CPU and you can get, you see, I got an alert from a click
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.140]   set application that it was up to 80% CPU usage, you can set the threshold.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.660]   And then this is like top genar, anybody who's used a Unix command line, basically you're
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:21.020]   going to get top here, which will show CPU usage, memory usage, and so forth.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:25.220]   And you can individually kill runaway apps, which is probably all you need to do.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.180]   And the creator of Watchdog, the reason I know this has written a fairly long explanation
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:36.300]   of why task killers don't work as well in under 2.2 and why you might want to use a
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   program like this.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300]   This actually is a great program.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.300]   It's called Watchdog.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.380]   I think it's a buck, two bucks in the store.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.100]   But here's my free pick.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.100]   This is my actual tool.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.580]   No, it's not Facebook.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.900]   It's this, very cool.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.540]   It's called Awesome Drop.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:57.940]   Now I've just launched Awesome Drop and it says, get your pin at labs.dashwire.com.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:04.300]   So let me just quickly type in labs.dashwire.com.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.140]   This does require, I think, 2.0 or later.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.620]   And when I go to labs.dashwire.com, there's a pin.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.260]   You might say, well, what the heck is that all about?
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.660]   Well, I'm going to enter that pin now into my Android device.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.260]   This is a Droid X.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.780]   It's connecting.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.000]   Now it's connected to what?
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.980]   To my browser.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:33.060]   And this browser, I can drag and drop files from my desktop to the browser.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.300]   Let me just, let me get a file here.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.300]   That is brilliant.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.300]   That's awesome.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.540]   Because you always forget your freaking USB cable, right?
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.940]   Yeah, I don't need it.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.580]   And you don't want to keep it.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:07:05.860]   It goes over 3G or, you don't even have to be on the same network for this to work.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.060]   It goes over the internet.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.940]   Now it's using the HTML5 drag and drop feature.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.900]   So you really pretty much have to use it with Chrome.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.340]   I guess it might work with Safari.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.340]   But hey, who doesn't use Chrome here?
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.900]   So that is a really slick program.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.260]   It's called Awesome Drop.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.900]   It's absolutely free.
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.300]   It's on the marketplace if you want to get it.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.420]   A-W-E-S-O-M-E Drop.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.420]   DROP.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.420]   By Dashwire.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:38.020]   And I think that's a pretty darn slick demonstration of what HTML5 can do.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.500]   Drag and drop to your browser and then to your phone.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.820]   Works over Wi-Fi and 3G.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.980]   And as you see, it works fast and it's easy to use.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.980]   Very cool.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980]   We should mention that Arcade Fire thing speaking of--
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:49.980]   Oh, you want to do that?
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.260]   Should we do it real quickly?
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.260]   Tell me about this.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260]   What is it?
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.780]   It's a Chrome experiment.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.340]   It's basically an arcade fire song and music video.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   It's in your browser.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.540]   It pops all kinds of different windows and it's customized.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:06.220]   So the whole concept of the video is that it's someone running to your child at home.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:09.220]   It's kind of going-- remembering your childhood, if I understand this correctly.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:13.660]   So when you go to the site, it asks you for the address of the place where you grew up,
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.220]   which is kind of a personal question to be asked by a website you don't really know.
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.220]   But if you do it--
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.220]   Make up a street.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220]   Make up a city.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.380]   Yeah, make up an address.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:24.900]   And then you hit go and it creates this really cool music video with like-- and do this in
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900]   Chrome.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:30.700]   It pops up all different windows with like really neat animations and video.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.460]   And it's somebody kind of running through the streets using Google Maps going to your
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   address.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.700]   It's really even the font is animated.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.620]   Yeah, don't touch the windows though because the first time I ran this, I started rearranged
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.620]   the windows.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.580]   You know how you just jump in and it's like, wait a minute, that's wrong.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.980]   And that screws it up.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.860]   So don't mess with the windows.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:48.860]   Let it do it.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.540]   Now there's one error here if you ask me.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.500]   I can't believe HTML5 doesn't allow you to get rid of the title bar and the URL window
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.500]   on a window.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   But maybe--
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.500]   Yeah, it's got to.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   It's crazy.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.420]   But maybe Java Script will do that.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.300]   So maybe they decided to leave that in.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.220]   But you see it's going to pop up new browser.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.140]   It's like when you go to one of those porn storm sites.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.180]   It's the second time I've mentioned porn on this show.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.620]   Really, I'm not a sick prisoner.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620]   It's purely research.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   It's purely for research.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.260]   But there's that little window at the bottom right hand corner where you can pause
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.260]   and mute it.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.220]   So you've actually-- I mean, it's kind of a new way to do video and multi-window.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.220]   It's really interesting.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.220]   It's neat.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.700]   It's playing the arcade fire song now.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.380]   But in a little bit, it'll start pulling up images.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.380]   I put Petaluma in as my hometown.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.780]   It'll pull up Street View images.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.740]   And that will tie into the lyrics of the song.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.740]   There it is.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.740]   There's Petaluma.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.980]   And you see the birds flying across.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.940]   And you even see a dot where the guy is running.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.940]   So it's kind of an interesting--
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.940]   I didn't see that.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.100]   It's kind of an interesting use of HTML5.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.100]   It's an experiment.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.100]   Let's put it that way.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.100]   Yeah, it's eye candy.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.100]   But it's fun eye candy.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   Yeah, pretty neat.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.020]   Gina Trapani is eye candy.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:58.140]   We know that absolutely from smarterware.org.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.940]   She's also writing and working for Fast Company.com.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.240]   You can see her new series on Fast Company.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.460]   It's fastcompany.com/worksmarter.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   Work smart.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.460]   Work smart.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.460]   Yep.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.460]   No er.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.140]   And then, Leo will be on video on an upcoming week.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.500]   Yes, you'll see me someday soon.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.480]   Jeff Jarvis is the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.820]   He also blogs at BuzzMachine.com.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:25.580]   And is a professor of journalism at the City University
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   of New York.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.740]   You were looking for-- I saw a tweet.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.060]   You said you had-- but you were looking for another grad student?
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.300]   Or what was that all about?
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.740]   I teach entrepreneurial journalism.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.500]   And if there's someone in New York, especially unemployed
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.420]   journalist but others, I have a little bit of space in the class.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.420]   Oh, nay.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:40.900]   So email.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.740]   You can go to my blog, BuzzMachine.com,
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.660]   and see the description of the course.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.700]   And I'll accept a few people based on the mix of the course.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.220]   Wow.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.980]   I've never heard of a professor advertising on Twitter.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.220]   That's a first.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.980]   Of course, it would be Jeff that would do that.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.340]   Jeff is professor 2.0.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.820]   He's professor 2.0, ladies and gentlemen.
