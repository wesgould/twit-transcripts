[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   And my very wonderful co-panelist at South by Southwest last week have all the geeks left town Stacey.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Oh no, they're still here. Well, most of the geeks have left and now we're up to music.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   So now it's the LA producers. No film kind of goes throughout the whole thing.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   Oh, okay. Yeah, well, I'll tell you some stuff that I wish I had gotten tickets to it.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   I'll tell you that in a second. First, let's say hi to Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   It's great to see you. Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to my boss. Thank you.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   I ain't your boss.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   I love the onion. You see that Elon Musk is going to be starting some sort of strange onion come from the company?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Well, I think Elon shouldn't do comedy, but that's, you know, you know, he does everything else.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Was he funny at South by?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   He sang.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   He sang?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   What?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   I don't know if he's funny and he cited Kanye West as his, was it his favorite musician?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Did he rap or sing?
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Uh, Singy Rappy? It's hard to say.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   Singy.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   It wasn't like.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   Singy Rappy.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Hold on. Let's see.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   He had a sold out talk at South by, you know, there were South by's come back, I think.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Mmm, no, no.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   No.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   No.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   He sang my little butter cup from the, the.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Oh, little butter cup, my little butter cup.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   That's a Gilbert and Sullivan, right?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   He's created a company according to this called FUD.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   THUD exclamation mark, which is going to be, oh boy, that's a master of the universe picture.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   I think he wants to be Indiana Jones or Han Solo or something.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I love him.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   He's wearing a bomber jacket with a fake fur collar and the black t-shirt and the black
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   t-shirt and his hair has been carefully quaffed to look as if it's not carefully quaffed.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Not quaffed.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   He's got the five o'clock shadow.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   Nice.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.840]   He, he tweeted early this morning that he, because we knew he retired, that he apparently
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.640]   attempted to buy the onion at some point.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.200]   Which right now is probably for sale.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Get a deal.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.960]   So he hired former staffers of the onion, including editor and chief Cole Bolton, executive
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.320]   editor Ben Berkeley.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.360]   And he's going to start something called the THUD or THUD, maybe just THUD, no THUD,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   just THUD.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.040]   THUD, he says, this is Elon.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.000]   Comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles, space exploration and brain computer
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   interfaces.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's funny.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's funny.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   He's got some humor.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.480]   I mean, did the boring company.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   That was pretty funny.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.400]   He's been planning this for a while.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.480]   The registration for THUD.com was December 6th, 2017 through GoDaddy.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   Oh, Elon.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Oh, Elon.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   He's, you know, he's not Jeff Bezos rich, but he's one fifth Jeff Bezos rich, which is
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   plenty.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   Doesn't he have a lot of low?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   Twenty billion.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   He may own money.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   He's not terribly liquid, I don't think.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.800]   But you know, that's not him probably.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320]   That's probably his company's, right?
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.040]   No, he, he put a lot.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   He put all of his PayPal money into his company's and I feel like variety says he's worth 20
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   billion.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.920]   I'm sorry, Forbes says he's worth 20 billion.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.280]   Oh, well, we all trust and love Forbes and their, their estimates of people's wealth.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.680]   Well, they are the ones who do the fortune 500 or whatever the, no, no, they do the
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   Forbes riches.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.480]   They do the Forbes riches.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   Fortune does a fortune.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   Yes.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   You know, there's a clue in there.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   I'll let you find a deal.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.960]   Which one the double trouble to be spanked with.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.160]   It helps you to straight.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's not a visual I ever want.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Oh, God.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.400]   So he made a lot of money for from PayPal, not anything like his current net worth, but
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.880]   you know, you know, pay about was only sold to eBay for 1.4 billion, but he's, he's parlated.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.480]   SpaceX is worth more than 20 billion Tesla.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.440]   I don't know how much Tesla is worth.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.880]   That depends on, on your outlook for Tesla.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.720]   Do you still love your Tesla?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   I do.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.760]   Although it has started rebooting.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   The screen reboots.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   Sometimes when I'm driving.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   I don't know if they were.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   When you're driving well.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   It's all right.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   You can still drive.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.600]   You can still drive, but I will tell you in Texas, the air conditioning also goes.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.840]   So your music, your nav and your AC go and you're like, Oh, it's basically.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   Pretty much you can steer.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   Can you open the window?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   You can open the window.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.000]   I guess in the model three, could, are there still window things or is everything?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.520]   Oh, everything's in that dash.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.040]   And I read a story from somebody who's had a bad screen and it really, it was really
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.680]   a problem until Tesla replaced it because you, it's all, there's no controls.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   It's all on that screen.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.360]   So Leo, by the question, do I sense that you're, will move off the road?
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.840]   It's almost two years in, it'll be two years in in July and it's getting a little janky,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.480]   getting a little funky and funky or janky.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   Janky.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   Those are important distinctions.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.120]   My 12 volt battery died a year and almost two years old and a 12 volt battery died.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.840]   And then, and then I called to replace it a week ago and they were supposed to call me
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.000]   back and they didn't call me back.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   They didn't call me back.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.840]   So finally, I mean, I called several times, like three times left messages because they
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   do a, what nice things.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.800]   They do a mobile repair, but they didn't, you know, it was like, come on guys.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.720]   And you can't bring a Tesla down to your local, you know, Jiffy lube.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.200]   You have to get them to fix it.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.920]   And so finally I, I called them again.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.840]   She said, Oh, I was just about to call you.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.520]   Oh, well, they called me like a dozen times over a, not like with a 12 volt battery issue,
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.160]   Leo, and I didn't have an issue.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.040]   So I was like, please, I'm good.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.560]   My, my battery is fine.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.720]   Well, apparently the 12 fold accessory batteries die rapidly on Teslas, which is ironic since
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.760]   they have a 90 kilowatt hour or whatever is battery pack in there.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.560]   But for some reason they use a separate accessory battery.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   So, so the resale is good, right?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.800]   I mean, you buy or you least I least is.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   I don't really care.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.080]   But I'm going to stay electric.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.320]   I really like electric.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   I'm not.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   I love the way my car drives.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   What would you get?
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   Would you get a little BMW or there's going to be lots of choices.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   You know, July 2019, when my lease runs out, there'll be lots of good choices.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.800]   I think, you know, the new, well, the Jaguar pace.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   What is it?
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   The I paste just came out.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.840]   Is that all electric?
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   All electric.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Oh, well, you guys look at the go ahead.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   VW bus.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.920]   No, that's not out yet.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.000]   But when that comes out, I'm definitely getting that.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.280]   It's the live bus.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.240]   But VW just the 20 billion dollars worth of batteries or something, right?
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   Geez.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.600]   What's the range for the Jaguar?
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.400]   It's a 90, 90, what is it?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   A kilowatt hour.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   It's 240 miles.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.680]   So does the bus get you more range because it just has so much room for battery?
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   Maybe.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Maybe you'll look into it.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   Oh, that's a Jaguar.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   That's nice looking.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   I know SUV.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   I'm not crazy about an SUV.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.080]   I'd rather have an XKE or an XJ.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   But still, I think I'm going to buy my next car from a company that makes cars.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   That's a thought.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   Oh, really crazy.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Crazy.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   I'll be crazy.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.040]   I still love my Tesla.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.880]   I would have done the Model 3, but we decided it was just, I didn't want to spend.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.120]   I think it was going to be the first one was like 50, 50k for basically what I wanted.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.840]   I was like, I don't feel that low.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.320]   I got my invitation to build my Model 3.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   You haven't or you did?
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.360]   I got the invitation and I declined it till next year.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.280]   I said I'm waiting for the dual motor four-wheel drive version, but I also just deferring.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.160]   But I was surprised because I ordered it much after the rush.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   Why do you need four-wheel drive?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.520]   You don't know snow.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   I just like it's more sure-footed.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   Oh, I see.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.200]   It's like driving a mountain goat.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   Nothing's like driving a mountain goat Stacy.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.240]   Have you ever driven a mountain goat?
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   I have not.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   Trust me.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.440]   But you know, that's what I envision when I see them like up there in the nature shows.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   I know.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.640]   Or those Grand Canyon mules.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.960]   Yeah, I haven't ever ridden on one of those.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.720]   So VW is very aggressively going into the electric VWs, by the way, Audi as well as Volkswagen.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.440]   $25 billion in batteries.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   VW's planning to build 3 million electric cars by the year 2025.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.800]   This is the bus you're talking about, but that's a concept.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.840]   No, there's a date coming up though.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   There's a, I think there's a date.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.880]   I would love a Volkswagen.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.320]   I used to have a Volkswagen.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.800]   I grew up with a Volkswagen bug.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:12.240]   And yeah, the ID buzz and the self-driving ID vision do in 2020.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.680]   So anyway, I figure by a year and a half from now, there'll be lots more choices.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.280]   Or we're at nuclear war with Korea.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   One of the other.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   Or there'll be no choice at all.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   Ta-da.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   Won't that be something?
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.440]   All right.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.800]   Let's move on to topics of the hour.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.920]   We now know Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, Google's World Developers Conference, Facebook's
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.040]   Developers Conference, and Microsoft's Developers Conference.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.160]   And they're all roughly in the same too much period.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.760]   I'm going to have to come up to California twice a juice.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   That's crazy.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.360]   You're coming to F8 and I know.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   I think so.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.600]   I think Microsoft though gets, I'm sorry, Apple gets the award for the best website.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.480]   Let me open up the WWDC website because it's really quite pretty.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:13.520]   apple.com/developer.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.200]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.680]   Let me reload it and you'll see the sweet anim- Hey!
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.000]   Now the animation's not working on this.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.080]   Oh, I have to click that maybe.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   That's what it is.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   Are you in Safari?
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.960]   Yeah, no, it doesn't actually work in Chrome for me, but I, but I, yeah, if I click this,
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   I think it will.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.560]   Now we're going to, yeah, look at this.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.000]   I want to do the Game of Thrones theme.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.880]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, um, WWDC.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:57.000]   Anyway, Google has a, so Jeff was mad at me because I discovered
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.920]   three words two years after he picked it on Google on this weekend Google, the three
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.320]   words that you forgot all of these links.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   I forgot all of it.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.120]   Well, it's one of the good things about getting to be a certain age.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.120]   I don't remember much.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   This is about going through 3000 links a week.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.440]   And so I was all excited about this idea that you could, you could describe any 10,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.400]   10 meter by 10 meters square on the world's on the earth's plan with three words.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.800]   And but Google has got its own things.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.480]   The reason is a lot of the world is not, does not have street addresses.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.080]   India for the Jews.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.440]   Did you do it for the Twitbrick house?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.040]   I did and I ordered a, a sign.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   I think it's, what is it?
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   Nazel.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.280]   It's, I know nasal's in there.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.320]   It's the three words.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.960]   So one of the things the, what three words guys did and said, and they said this on, they
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:06.000]   did this on purpose is that there's no similarity between squares and their adjacencies to avoid
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.440]   accidentally entering something close, but not the same.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   So if you made a mistake in the three words, it would be very obvious, like, oh, I didn't
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.840]   really want to go to the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.440]   I'm just trying to go downtown.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.920]   But Google's done the opposite.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.040]   So they've come up with a new global code system.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.960]   They're calling plus codes.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   It is an open source.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   Well done.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.560]   One second Leo, because you lost me at your, you never actually told us what Jeff thought.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   So I'm listening to you describe three words.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.520]   Oh, just an idea that I, I, I revealed the three words on this show a good two years before
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.000]   Leo thought he'd discovered them.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So I got pissy.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Do you get pissy?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   What are the, you don't remember that?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Oh, maybe you were here.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Okay.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So what?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I wasn't here.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   So I have no idea.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So what are you guys talking about?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Well, that's not a good one.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   But I'm telling you, I'm saying, oh, I'm not going to go to the other side.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Oh, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   The next place I'm going to deliver the email is to walnuts, fizzes, water.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Oh, that's the Mexican Art Museum in downtown Austin, actually.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So, yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You have the way what three words works is it doesn't -- you could enter it in their map
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   or you could send it from their map the GPS coordinates to a regular map and use that.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So, yeah, you're right, with the postal service that might be complicated.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   What Google's proposing is more like kind of like zip codes.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You have a four character, and I say character because it's numbers or letters, area code,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and then you have a seven character local code.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So, it's a lot like your phone number, except it's not just numbers.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It's got -- it's harder -- it's like British postal codes.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's harder to remember when it's a mix of numbers and letters.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Right. It also has, I think, a mistake, which the folks at what three words were -- didn't,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   you know, when we did what three words, they were quick to point out, oh, listen to my Samsung phone.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   That's the -- I'll be showing the S9 a bit.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's what Samsung thinks of ringtones and sound like.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's like a symphony.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Like you're at an elevator.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah. Like the doors of the elevator opened.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I'm not going to -- I don't want to be racist.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's a bad way to start a sentence.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   You should stop there.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I'm like, you know what? If you don't, just stop there.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Then don't. Then don't.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   It's more cultural than racism.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But South Korea, the aesthetics of phones created in South Korea, Samsung particularly,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   it's clearly culturally very different from --
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   From the Rooka-Koh.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Well, it's just different. I mean, I celebrate the difference.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I'm going to be in Korea next month. I can't wait.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But there is a -- but that culture -- so sometimes companies take pains to kind of gloss over,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   you know, make it more Americanized.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Samsung, I don't know if they do a good job of that.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   So, it's like that ringtone is like -- I don't think that really is a good ringtone,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   but maybe it plays well in Korea.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I might as well show you.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Did I show you the creepy AR emojis?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   This is my -- I'll show you my AR.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Actually, you know what? I can do it on Google Photos by now.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's probably -- oh, no, maybe it doesn't because I haven't uploaded it.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I'll do it in the gallery.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   There's my lovely wife.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And there's some pictures of me and Jason and Megan with our --
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   it's not a Snapchat filter. It's an AR emoji.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And here's what it thinks I look like.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Oh, you look like Anderson Cooper.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   We all look alike. All us white guys.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So, that's the AR emoji.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And as Brian X Chen said in the New York Times,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   he did a review featuring his AR emojis.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Not really very good.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   But, okay. It's just not Apple.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Apple quality.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I'll do more on this phone in a bit, but that's -- I thought you'd want to --
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   So you were saying that Google made a mistake and it's --
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah, so --
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so discursive today.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   That's why we're here.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   They -- so, first of all, the first four codes -- first of four characters in the ARic code,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   100 by 100 kilometers.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And in the last six characters --
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I thought it was seven.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Oh, maybe the plus doesn't count.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   The plus isn't just a character.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Or the plus isn't just a character.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   They say the last six characters are the local code.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   No, I'm wrong. I got a plus in line two.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I think the plus is there just as a separator.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And I have -- I have seven plus the plus.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Oh, I address.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Maybe because you're in local areas so many people?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Well, the last six characters are the local code,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and that gets down to 14 by 14 meters.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The area code's not needed with navigating within intent, obviously.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But there is another optional character that could be appended to provide more accuracy down to 3 by 3.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Yeah, so I increased the size of the map and then clicked on the spot so it gave me the extra character.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   That's what you got.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   So where do I want the drone to land?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Well, that's probably what this is for, isn't it?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I don't -- I get that not every place has addresses, but why go with something complicated as opposed to something easy for people to remember?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I guess it's four computers because we just assume computers take us everywhere.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Well, that's why I liked what three words.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Thank you, Jeff, for that tip because it's human.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It's okay.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It's okay though.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So you can remember Glow Walnut Nasal a lot better than IKEA and AGC2CMXR plus X6.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Now, I remember talking to Tim Berners-Lee, the guy who created the World Wide Web, and he said,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   "I never intended anybody to see HTTP colon slash slash."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   That was always -- those URIs were always intended for machines.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   What he underestimated was how that would become, you know, saying www.twit.tv would become a way to make it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Plus what led to the cue cat.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You remember the cue cat?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Cue cat.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   No one's ever going to deal with his complicated URIs.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's my guess that Google says the same thing about these codes that, "Oh, these are -- these are --"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And boy, you nailed it, Jeff.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   That's clearly what this is for, is drones.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Oh, yeah, because I can actually -- if I pull, like, my house --
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Okay.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   You can get your roof, right?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I can get the front of my house.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Oh, the roof.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I can get the middle of my house and the back of my house.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Oh.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Have you done it for your address there, Leo?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   No.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   How do I do that?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   We're going to do it.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   We're going to --
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   In that story, it had a link to how to do it.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Okay.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Just go to plus code -- HTTPS slash --
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Slash --
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Slash --
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Slash --
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Slash --
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You forgot the code.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   It won't work without the colon.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Right.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I did for him.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Tim Bernersley, I got it.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Okay.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Open -- it's based on Open Location code -- a standalone Open Source library.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Here's the world's largest carrot.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Plus dot codes.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Plus dot codes.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Okay.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Here we go.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   What makes it unique, free, accessible --
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So let me --
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   In your city or plus code.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   See now, what was nice -- I wonder if I could put "twit" LLC because --
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   What was nice is I put "twit" LLC in what three words in a new where we were.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Yeah, it does.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Okay.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   There you go.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   In Petaluma is 7AGM plus M6.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Now, if you go up -- expand the size of the map, you know, plus it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I'll give it a little more.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Other way.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I'll go in.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Zoom in.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So this has the front door in it.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   This is where the front door is, right?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   So I could do a smaller box.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Oh, look.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   There you go.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   That's the front door right there.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   So that's the landing spot for the drone.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   You could just pinpoint it, right?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Go to our roof.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   See the last letters changing.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Changed on, yeah.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But they are square.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So buildings that aren't square, it's kind of like -- like I'm looking over one of my old
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   apartment complexes just to see like, "Ooh, would that even get to me?"
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Well, they said they can do --
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   You can pick the picture.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   High resolution.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   You've changed the world.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Three meters by three meters, which is 10 feet by 10 feet.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.280]   I would guess you're not going to land a drone anywhere where you don't have 10 by 10, at
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.440]   least free, right?
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   Right.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.120]   Well, that's a big -- I was actually talking to an architect at a party about like thinking
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   about houses and houses.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   They're going to have landing drones.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   Landing drones.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   Holy cow.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   Oh, really?
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.120]   Because like, how do you think about where drones land?
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   I've got a great place because I've got a flat roof, but you know, everybody else is
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   great.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.320]   So you're going to -- just like, you know, they design ships with a big H in a circle
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.800]   on it, if you're going to land helicopters, you're going to have to drive drone and
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.560]   probably they'll have to have some sort of optical signal and maybe even some lighting
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   signals.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:29.440]   The reason it's interesting is because New Zealand just approved a test of drone delivery.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.320]   Didn't we just approve one, too?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   This is -- We've got somewhere in the U.S.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.120]   Well, we had Domino's doing pizza delivery, right?
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   No, hold on.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.720]   But this is -- who is this that's doing the drone deliveries at Amazon in New Zealand?
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:54.120]   Well, the other thing New Zealand just approved, or I think approved, is Larry's Aerotaxy Company.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.400]   That's the one I was thinking of.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   Sorry.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   Larry's Aerotaxy Company.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   Yes.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   The drone.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.000]   The horror is an electric sky-oober drone from Sebastian Thrun.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.400]   Larry Page funded it.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.240]   Thrun, of course, was the former head of the Google X.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.440]   And the creator of the self-driving car, Google.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   Yes.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.920]   It's Quora, which is a vertical takeoff and landing personal airplane helicopter drone
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.880]   that will carry a passenger.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.080]   Oh, that's not much use.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.720]   This I want.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.600]   But what's interesting is look at -- if you look at -- it really is stealth because look
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   at the front.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.120]   It looks like there's a dashboard and, you know, windows.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.080]   So -- but they're tinted, so you can't tell if there's a driver.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.360]   And they've -- people have seen these are never sure if they can't see a driver.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.600]   That's because there is no driver.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   Otherwise, no, it was a pilot.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   Okay.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   So --
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   It's a pilot driver.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   The Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.600]   There's no liveryman.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   How does it go without liveryman?
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   How do they do it without pages?
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   Footmen.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.480]   I need a footman to open the door.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   Sorry, go ahead, Stacy.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.720]   No, that's okay.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.600]   I'm answering the question about drone delivery in the U.S.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:11.160]   So according to the Wall Street Journal at a FAA UAS symposium last week, Jay Merkel,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:17.400]   a senior FAA or a traffic control official said that some proponents of drones, such as
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   Amazon, "thick they might be ready to operate this summer."
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   So --
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.200]   I see -- we poo-pooed this.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.400]   Remember how we laughed when --
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.600]   In the 60 Minutes piece, was it with Larry Page?
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.880]   No, it was Jeff Bezos.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   And Charlie --
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   Yes.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.280]   Charlie, he's in "Disgrace Now," Rose --
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   Rose.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.040]   And he's getting all loud about it, yeah.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.120]   -- was so incredibly loud.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   Because Bezos did this reveal.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.320]   And look, here's where we test the drones for delivery.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   And we were laughing.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.960]   We said, "Charlie Rose got played.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.880]   They're never going to do that."
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   Wrong.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.400]   I guess if you have fully autonomous drones, it really know how to avoid everything.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.640]   Power lines, other drones.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.520]   You could have thousands in the air.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   Birds.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.800]   Birds, everything.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   You could have -- but it's still better than the street, right?
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.560]   I mean, there's a lot more stuff on the ground.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   You could --
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.560]   Well, the idea is that --
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   Go ahead, I see.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.080]   -- that you could reduce a lot of trans -- or some transportation traffic, I think, on the
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   street.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.480]   Well, and after all, Amazon's biggest expense at this point's delivery, right?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Has to be shipping.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Shipping.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.040]   I don't know if it's the biggest, but it was a huge -- I think last year it was like
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.080]   a $7 billion loss for them.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.800]   I mean, it's one thing that can stand in the way of profit is --
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.640]   -- Amazon doesn't care about profit.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.280]   -- Well, at some point, they're going to.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.440]   And if they do drones, either --
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.760]   -- they do care.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.240]   They have a very macro -- they just don't care about excessive --
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.640]   -- they have a long-term focus and bravo.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   And that's one of the reasons they were seriously looking at drone delivery.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.960]   And it's almost almost almost what you remember the UPS video from last year ago, where the
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.640]   brown truck arrives, then out of it come a bunch of drones to nearby addresses.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   -- Oh, wow.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   -- I'll put that up on you.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   So it's the last model.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.800]   It solves the last mile problem.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.760]   Oh, here we go.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   Right.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.000]   So you don't have drones going all over the hill on the high up.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Right.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.120]   Although you could, it just would blackout the sun for a period of time.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   There you go.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   God.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.840]   I'm thinking a lot of the liveries.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   I'm like -- during Christmas season, what happens?
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.040]   We don't see the sun anymore.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   It got dark.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.920]   Oh, it's just Christmas.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   It would be loud.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   I mean, that's one thing.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.360]   I mean, when you hear the drones around like drones are loud.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   They're loud.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   That's the problem.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.120]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.320]   I'm not excited by drones to the extent other people are.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.120]   I just -- they're loud.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.720]   They're irritating.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.120]   They -- I don't know.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.720]   I like looking at the sky.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.000]   That might be part of my problem.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I'm from Texas.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I love my horizons.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.120]   Well, you know why -- you don't -- this is why I don't like drones.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.160]   This is -- thank you, chat room, for this link to the Tinkersons.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   Let's see if we can fly the drone.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.400]   The father says to the son, the drone goes up in the air and then zip.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.320]   Let's see if we can find the drone.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.280]   That's pretty much my drone story in a nutshell.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.480]   So if you're into this, people out there in the world, there's a conference that -- in
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.320]   the early days I helped organize, I haven't been able to be there for the last two years,
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.240]   but really nice guy named John Kellen runs called Postal Vision 2020.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   You're kidding.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.800]   And it's about the future of delivery and the postal service.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.080]   And I got -- we got Tim Burgers Lee to -- I'm sorry.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   We got Ben Serf to keynote early on.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.240]   And they've had drone companies there and new package companies there and all kinds of
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   things.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.080]   Logistics are actually pretty damn fascinating because it's about atoms.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.920]   We're about atoms.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   So I'm going to have to ask you about this, Stacy, because you have the wired home.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.440]   By the way, I asked Stacy's husband Andrew how he felt about all that.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   I met Andrew.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   It was great in Austin.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   Oh, gosh.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.160]   He was surprisingly sanguine about the whole thing.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.640]   The only thing he seemed like was an issue was something about the blinds.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   Ah!
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.040]   This is a three-year effort.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   I have these crazy proprietary blinds.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.400]   I bought this thing to convert it to Z-Wave.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.360]   It is a monstrosity.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.920]   It has a click wheel.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.320]   So when I program it, I have to get my little screwdriver and put the click wheel.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   And it's a nightmare.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.720]   Mom, why is the house always dark?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   Shush.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.560]   It'll be fixed around here.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.400]   We have perfectly acceptable remote controllers, but he wants it to be...
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   He wants to talk to it.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   Oh, it's his fault.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   Are you saying it's Andrew's fault?
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.120]   No, no, I'm not blaming him.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.640]   He just...
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Every year...
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.160]   He's like, "It's my birthday, Stacy.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.720]   Maybe we can make the blinds work again."
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.440]   Because they did for a little bit.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   That's so cute.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   That's so cute.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   That's so cute.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.880]   Yeah, every couple has one of those.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.840]   Just this running joke.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.480]   It's the "How You Load the Dishwasher."
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   Yeah, that's a big one.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   It is.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.400]   We're total in agreement on that.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.560]   Fork tines up or down?
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.560]   I think that's why we're in agreement.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   That's why you're in agreement.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.560]   You don't have a strong opinion.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.400]   But we do have a strong opinion about the toilet paper roll.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   You roll over.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Of course.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   But our daughter...
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.960]   Our daughter does it under.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   Savage.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.400]   Where did she get that?
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.720]   No, she's just so young.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.600]   She doesn't understand physics yet.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.880]   No, I've explained it to her.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.800]   She stills she chooses to do it that way.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.720]   Should I nip her personality in the mind?
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.160]   No, this is called rebellion.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.920]   It's just the beginnings, Stacy.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   I'll accept that as my rebellion.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   That's it.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   No, that's not bad.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.760]   I'm going to give you a video that you'll like as a result.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   Okay.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   Here we go.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   The next one up.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   Meanwhile, I'm going to ask Stacy...
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   Oh, my turn work.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   A little bit as soon as I see this.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   That retines.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   Here it is.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   I got it.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   That's the one you sent, right?
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   No, I sent one earlier.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.400]   No, this one's not showing up.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.800]   I'll put it on the rundown under other.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   Sorry.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.200]   It ruins a punchline.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   Okay.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   It's in the mind.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   We just added it.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.200]   There you go.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.000]   Just added it to the punchline.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.200]   This is how a thud is going to work.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.760]   Is that the worst name for a humor site?
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.240]   Well, you always say a joke landed with a thud when it's not successful.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   But sure.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.520]   The excavation point though really makes you enthusiastic.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520]   Thud.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   Thud.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   Like Yahoo.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.720]   I'm thinking it's probably an acronym.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   Okay.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.600]   Oh, there it is.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.160]   Got it.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.920]   Did it help that I typed hello?
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   Did that like...
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.560]   Yes, somehow it did freedom.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.960]   Yeah, I unlocked it somehow.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   I thought it might.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   Everyone say hi to Kevin.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   Hi Kevin.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   Kevin.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   Kevin on.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.560]   He just sent me his plus code.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   Oh.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.160]   Here is a story.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.320]   Is this Kramer?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   No.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.960]   It's like the fake sign fell.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.400]   Watch me.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   This is, this is mad about you.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.080]   Guys never.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.200]   This is, you know why everybody's laughing because they recognize it.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   It's true.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   It is true.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   It's true.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.360]   They, because, no, I don't, there's reasons for that.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.240]   They're not good ones.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   Not good ones.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.600]   No, not good ones.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   All right.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.240]   Google Assistant's multi-step smart home routines are now live.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   I knew when I saw this headline, there was only one person who could explain it all to
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   me.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Stay safe.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   It's not medium.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   Yeah, it's not safe.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.000]   So, I am so sad because I don't have this.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Oh.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   No.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.400]   That was, so I don't have it yet, but I do have opinions on it because I've never let,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.800]   they are still rolling it out.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.720]   I was really disappointed with this.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.360]   So there's, there's reasons.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   Okay.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:31.800]   So it's good in the sense that it shows you how it, it helps a novice person who has
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.440]   some of these devices think about their morning routine and like what they might want to
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.280]   include because it's a checklist that you check off.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.360]   The downside to this is you can't do anything custom.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.040]   So if you're like the hardcore smart home user, you're going to look at this and be like,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.320]   "Rah, I want to do more."
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.720]   And then you're probably going to turn to Google shortcuts.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.360]   And then you're going to be extra frustrated because Google shortcuts is awful.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   Oh.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:04.240]   I have, Google shortcuts to me is one of the most frustrating user experiences I've ever
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.200]   encountered because it feels like it should be easy.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.680]   You tell it, "Good morning."
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.920]   And then you're like, "And this is what I want you to do."
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.400]   But because Google has some weird naming, Google Home has weird naming conventions and
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.080]   because it doesn't tell you when you do something wrong, I have a lot of shortcuts I've tried.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.240]   They don't work.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   And I don't know why.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.280]   So I have to like basically remove one item at a time and try to reverse engineer my way
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.920]   back to like a working state and then add again to see what the heck I did wrong.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.360]   I hate it.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:44.320]   So I'm not too, I mean, if you're into routines, you know, if it works for you and these options
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.760]   are great, like I like the bedtime one where it's like put my phone on silent if you have
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.040]   an Android device.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.240]   And so I would totally check that.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.400]   I don't really use like Glass if this than that or, you know, something like that for those,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.880]   isn't that easier?
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.920]   I do that, but maybe if it is too much for people.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.240]   If you don't want to use if, if you're like, "Oh, Google's letting me do these things,"
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.800]   then maybe this is nice.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.640]   I also don't use my, oh, good.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   At this point, you'd say Echo is probably a better choice for voice home automation or
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   no.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   Yes.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:30.520]   I started using my Google home more and I find myself defaulting to the Echo for all
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.480]   but inquiries.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   So yes.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.760]   Does the Echo have multi, what is this multi step?
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   They do.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.960]   They have multi multi.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   Yes.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.560]   They don't have routines.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.640]   They have, what do they call it?
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   Hold on.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.880]   I've got to look to see what they call it because I can never remember their weird words.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.120]   And then the Echo this last week just allowed you to start saying things and following it
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.800]   up with more commands without having to say Madam A's name again, which is nice.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   Okay.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   Sorry.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   I do like that.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   That's the follow up thing.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   I misunderstood that.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.160]   I thought it was like the contextual follow up that Google's assistant does where you could
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.640]   say how tall is Shaquille O'Neal and then how fat is he?
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.800]   And then it's too much in the nose.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   But that's not what it is.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.520]   It's just you say, once you say Echo, the trigger word, whatever it is you've chosen
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.160]   once, you can then, I guess it keeps listening for a little bit of time.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   There's follow up.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.680]   So, no, actually what you're talking about is true.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.000]   They have, sorry, I'm confused because my world is confused.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.960]   There's contextual follow up.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   Contextual follow up.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.320]   And that's separate from don't you don't have to say the trigger word twice in a row.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   Yes.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Okay.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.720]   But so going back to the beginning because I'm on cold medicine and I have to stay focused,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.920]   there is Echo has routines too.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   At least you have an excuse.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   I have no excuse for how.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.560]   So Echo does call their routines routines and it's the same sort of thing.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.240]   You tell it to what you can say and then it offers you a lot of options.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.080]   I don't know if you can see my phone.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.120]   So it offers you options, but then it also lets you add your own.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   So it's more flexible.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.480]   So there you go.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.600]   So then Google added something important to this whole main log, which I put on the
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.720]   rundown, which is you can now do location based reminders on assistance.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.120]   I love that feature.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.960]   I've used that feature for a long time in Apple on iPhones.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.880]   And I think keep does that as well, right?
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.600]   You could say to keep remind me here's my gross list.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.880]   Remind me, pop up that list when I get to the grocery store.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   I had no idea.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.320]   Oh, that's a nice feature.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.120]   I used to have an if recipe that when my husband got near the grocery store, he would
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   text him.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   Oh, it's a really nice feature.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.720]   Ask me if I need stuff at the grocery store.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   That's really funny.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   But that's good.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.440]   I might have to implement that.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.800]   Well, so the downside is he always got a text even when he was just driving by the
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.720]   case, just the intended function, but he was like, it's not so bad.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   This is irritating.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.080]   The grocery store is right by our house.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:11.320]   That's ultimately, unfortunately, the ultimately the most common response of a person married
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.800]   to a geek, this is annoying.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   Stop it.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's like Seinfeld and New Man.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.480]   New Man.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   Stacey.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.880]   So, keep has done this for a while.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.760]   And I started doing it with apples for minders.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.600]   So if you have a list or something, you can associate it like the pet.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.000]   I have the Petaluma market list.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.160]   You can associate it with the Petaluma market.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.240]   And then I actually have to give my app permissions now to get a location information,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   which I guess I had turned off.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.800]   Let's do that right now.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.880]   And now that it's got permission is information, I can add a location to this.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.960]   Let's see.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.680]   This is our shopping list.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.600]   Oh, you don't would be good though.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.800]   Tie this to the more granular level of the post codes.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.440]   I figured I would do that because it's got the Petaluma market thing.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   So yeah, oh yeah.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.840]   And maybe that's my Google's value of the plus codes, right?
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.880]   Yeah, because then when my husband drives by, it's not in the parking lot.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.520]   So it's a pin icon that will say, I guess that would make it less annoying.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   I like it.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   Here it is.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   Edit reminder place or time.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.000]   So normally reminders time, you know, it's four o'clock reminding of a mow the lawn.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.680]   This is place Petaluma market.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.200]   So whenever I get to that place, not yet, or maybe you could, you know what?
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.360]   That would be an easy enough thing for them to do, right?
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.480]   Because right now, yeah, I bet you you can because it pops up the map means inside.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.800]   Oh, that would be much better.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.440]   Because you want to just like you, Stacy, this works when you're driving by, you're in the
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.000]   vicinity, you're on the roof, whatever.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.520]   And then you don't necessarily want that.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520]   So that's good.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.040]   If you had a plus code for the front door of the market and that's when it popped up,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.280]   that's exactly that would eliminate some of these false alarms.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   Because one of my, one of my things that I'm constantly looking for in my smart home implementations
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.840]   is actually walking through the door based reminders.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:19.640]   So when I leave my front door, right, I want a reminder, like, jacket, like, yeah, check
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   the stove.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   Yeah, lock.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.600]   Whatever needs to, like what you need to bring for your day.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   And so far.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.920]   So is this doesn't work.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.320]   So that's something new though.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.000]   They're going to have location.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.640]   How is that going to work with a static device, location reminders?
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:43.200]   It just let you add it to the reminder somehow.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.680]   Is this an echo or I forgot?
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.520]   Is this in Google home or an echo?
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.040]   I think it's Google assistant.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   Aren't we talking about that?
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.920]   Oh, assistant would make sense because that would be in your phone.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   Okay.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.720]   I don't know.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.960]   We're all losing it.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.080]   I just, yeah, I just have too many things on my stack.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.000]   I blew my stack.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Okay.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.840]   So Google routines support pages live.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.640]   And actually they care about this a lot because I sat on it for a minute or two and I got
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.280]   a pop up saying, would you like some help from a service representative?
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.680]   So I'm surprised it's not available to you.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   That's what I'm like.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.040]   I'm like, Google, come on.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.920]   So right now they have good morning bedtime leaving home.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.440]   Oh, you could do this to the assistant.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.200]   So you could say, hey, Google, I'm home.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.640]   So that's kind of location based.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.440]   Hey, as well.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   I just got it.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   Yay.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.640]   How do you know you have it?
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   How do you, where do you go?
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   Sorry.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:49.320]   Oh, you go into hold on settings for your in their Google home or Google assistant app.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.840]   And if you scroll down to services, you'll see music, home control, news, routines.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   Nice.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   Oh, look.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   Okay.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   My asset.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.240]   I'm totally, I'm doing the good morning.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.120]   And this doesn't require a Google home.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.880]   This is or is it?
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880]   Does it?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   It does.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   It's not.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   Oh, it's icy.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.160]   It's your Google assistant, but it's on the Google home.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   Right.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.240]   Because I'm going to talk to the well, I guess I could talk to my Google home on any device
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.840]   because it's telling me what devices is available.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   Right.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   Cancel.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   Okay.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.440]   So I'm going to take my phone off silent.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.400]   I'm going to adjust some lights.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.560]   I'm going to adjust my thermostat.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.440]   And you, this would be whenever you say I'm home.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.320]   I'm going to, it's when I say good morning, tell me about my day or I'm up.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.600]   Those are, oh, can I add?
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   So this is not.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.840]   Yes, I can add a command.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.440]   So it's much more functional than Amazon.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.160]   Oh, no, Amazon's the same sort of functionality.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   Okay.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.800]   See, this is a problem because here we are presumably experts, certainly seasoned users
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.440]   of these devices.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.240]   And we're, this is like, we haven't set this up.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.760]   I haven't set it up on the echo and it would, and it sounds great when you described it.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.640]   I love all that.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   But I don't, I just.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.280]   So Google makes it.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.440]   That's what Google's trying to do.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.760]   So like here I am, it's showing, I don't know.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.760]   Hold on.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.040]   Let me dim my screen for y'all.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   So here it's showing me.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Ta-da.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.120]   That's a whole long list.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.720]   And you could check those boxes too.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.920]   I'm checking these boxes.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.880]   Now when it says, tell me about today's calendar, I'm still a host because I can't get my G Suite
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.720]   calendar information.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.560]   But I can on the echo.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.760]   So that's why I prefer to ask her about like what's on my schedule today, which is just
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.000]   aggravating.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.880]   And then so it has me adjust the media volume, it says, and then play music, news, radio
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.440]   podcasts, audiobook or nothing.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   Nice.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:00.840]   Let's see what, oh, so yeah, and this, the audiobooks is only Google Playbooks, which
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.960]   one would expect I suppose.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.440]   So discard.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.760]   There you go.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.600]   More to come.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.600]   CEO and Jeff are confused show.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   Stay tuned.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.000]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.920]   Our show today.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   This is my Friday.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.680]   That's the only excuse I have to offer.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.280]   This is my Friday.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.840]   I'm on the, I'm already on my weekend.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.600]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   I did.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.120]   I have to say, I can't blame it on a bad night's sleep.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.400]   Those Casper mattresses, man, you sleep so good.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.480]   Oh, my Casper mattress.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.720]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.080]   You know how they do that?
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:54.120]   They eliminated the number one reason mattresses cost so much, dealing with resellers and showrooms.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.200]   By eliminating those costs and passing the savings on to you, you're going to save a
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.040]   huge amount.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.600]   Now what they don't have is a place you can go lie in a Casper.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.960]   Well, they do actually in some places like New York City, but in most places, the idea
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.720]   is that you, you know, lying on a mattress in a showroom isn't going to do you any good
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   anyway.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:18.160]   You need to get your Casper in your house, lie on it for a night or two or three or a
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   hundred.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.960]   And if at any time in the first hundred nights, you don't love your mattress.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.880]   You just call them, they'll come and get it refunded every penny that we know.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.960]   So there's no risk, no risk at all.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.360]   The original Casper mattress combines the multiple supportive memory phones.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.600]   They kind of pioneered this for a sleep surface with just the right sink, yet just the right
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.920]   bounce plus its breathable design.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.040]   Let's you sleep cool.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.560]   That's so important.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.920]   Even in the winter, even when it's snowing outside, you've got the heater on, you get
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   overheated and that's not good.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.080]   But the Casper mattress helps you regulate your temperature throughout the night.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:00.960]   So you're always comfortable and it provides long lasting comfort and support.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.640]   And I really like that.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   And it's risk free.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.280]   I mean, you got to try this.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.520]   Casper understands the importance of trying out a mattress.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.160]   That's why they give you a hundred days.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.640]   And it makes you feel a little bit better because you know, there's no risk free shipping
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.720]   and returns in the US and the Canada and the UK.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.520]   And by the way, they come in a very compact box.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.240]   You open the box and the mattress comes out.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   It's ready to sleep on.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   You don't have to air it out or anything.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.640]   It just feels great, smells great right away.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:38.000]   I actually, both my kids ended up in the dorms with Casper mattresses because, well, it was
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   nice to have a fresh new mattress and the cost was low enough that I didn't mind.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.160]   And it was easy.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.040]   I shipped it to them in the box.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.360]   They just, they could carry the box upstairs.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   Henry was on the third floor.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   It's easy.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.880]   I think you might have gotten a friend and to help them and then boom, it opens it up
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.880]   and there it goes.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.360]   And it was so affordable after four years.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.480]   I said, "Keat, leave it there."
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   You don't need to bring it back.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.960]   It's okay.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.640]   Leave it for the next guy.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   Get a Casper mattress today.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.040]   You can say $50 towards select mattresses by going to Casper.com/twig and use the promo

[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.440]   Gotta use that promo code if you want to get the $50 off.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.920]   We love Casper.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.080]   We thank them so much for making our show possible.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   Breaking news.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   Breaking news.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.080]   This just did.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   Breaking news.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   This just did.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   Not so fries.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.720]   Become Taco Bell's highest selling product.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.880]   Oh, I don't even want to know what that is.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.760]   So I'm going to have 53 million orders in the first five weeks.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:48.040]   If it has to do with queso, it's relevant to the show.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.480]   Do we really want to call Taco Bell's cheesy sauce queso?
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.680]   I'm just asking.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.920]   I mean, I eat a Taco Bell like any other fool, but.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.840]   So explain to me.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.040]   This looks like a French fries.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   It made out of potato.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.000]   It is a French fries.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.440]   It's their take on fries.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:11.480]   They have a Taco Bell spicy seasoning and then you dip it in cheese instead of ketchup.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.680]   It's cheesy fries.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.280]   And you can't get the cheese.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.160]   They don't they don't offer the cheese with chips or anything.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.160]   They just offer with the.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.200]   Can you get a ketchup if you want ketchup?
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.600]   No, no, you go to McDonald's for ketchup.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.560]   53 million orders in five weeks.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.560]   Oh my God.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.760]   It's just a mind boggling, isn't it?
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.080]   Yeah, that's why I actually buy my Mexican food from actual Mexican food shops.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.840]   Did you have any queso in Austin?
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.840]   I did.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.240]   Now, tell me if I went to the wrong place.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.800]   I went to Uncle Julio's.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.600]   It was all right.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.000]   We didn't know.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.960]   You know, I have to say we we we we went to Franklin's try to go to Franklin's barbecue.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.400]   And literally that's crazy.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.880]   You can't I don't know who goes there.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   Don't go during South by.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.440]   Don't go there ever.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.160]   Six in the morning, it's a six hour wait.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160]   We got there.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   I thought, Oh, okay.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   Well, I know not to go in the morning.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   Nobody ever gets in.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.160]   I mean, you get in, but you wait six hours.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.440]   I'm not waiting six hours for lunch.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.320]   So then we go a Brown noon figuring all people be gone by then.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:19.520]   No, the lady said she offered me a beer, which was nice from her bucket.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.080]   And she said, it'll be about two hours.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.240]   And I said, well, there'll be anything left.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.440]   She said, there's no guarantee.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.440]   So we left.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   We went back downtown and we went to a place called Cooper's.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   It was amazing.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.120]   Cooper says, not bad barbecue.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.080]   Really, it's Texas.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.600]   You can't get bad barbecue.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.240]   I mean, very good.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.320]   That's a moment where Stacy should have the glove in her home.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.200]   Leah could look the side eye.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   You just got Stacy.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   Where should I go on?
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   I don't know.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   I didn't know.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.040]   No, no, Franklin says, okay, see, this is what's wrong with our foodie culture.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.640]   People like go and eat perfectly good barbecue and they're like fomoeing.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.280]   They make a fetish of it.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Yeah, they make a fetish.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   They make a good barbecue.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.560]   You know, I got great barbecue and I frankly thought Uncle Julio's was fine.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.680]   They make guacamole at the table.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.280]   That was awesome.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   Many places make guacamole.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.800]   Yeah, that's like, you know, that's like table.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.160]   I'm easily amused.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.000]   They had a tortilla making machine.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.600]   Oh, no, you have to have the one on the I wanted the mama's seat to making them by
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   hand, but that's all right.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.920]   She was there, but she was putting the balls of dough in the machine.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.920]   It was going.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.120]   That wasn't quite as good.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:35.800]   When I was in Mexico, that was the best tortillas I've ever had, which that, you know, the grandma
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.320]   is standing there making them by hand.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   They were so good.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.920]   You did see the Brooklyn barbecue, didn't you?
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   What's Brooklyn barbecue?
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   Well, it was a story to me.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.120]   So I just put up on the rundown.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.040]   Obviously I actually falling behind.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.920]   Wait, it was, it was last week.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.080]   What's the birth of March five?
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.320]   Well, this happened.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   What is it?
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   Brooklyn barbecue comments.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   Does the picture, the picture says it all.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.920]   De Blasio decides if Texas or Brooklyn has the best barbecue, that one.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.400]   No, I put it in the run now.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.360]   Oh, vice claims Brooklyn barbecue is world famous.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.640]   Now it is in the worst way possible.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.320]   Why is Brooklyn barbecue to take the pictures in Brooklyn?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.440]   It's in Brooklyn.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.320]   That's barbecue as defined by Brooklyn.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.920]   So it's hipster barbecue.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.280]   Oh, no, see that sauce.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   Yeah, they would never.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.240]   I do like fried okra.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:39.160]   But see what I liked about Texas barbecue and we talked to that guy John from ATX, the
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:49.320]   Instagram guy, the ATX barbecue guy who Texas monthly named the top 50 Texas barbecues.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.160]   He went to all of them in 38 days.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.160]   He's a.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.680]   And he wasn't dead when we saw him.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:01.920]   He was still alive, although both he and Stacy used a term I had never heard before that
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.800]   kind of scared me meat sweat.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.360]   It's the meat sweats.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.080]   It's what happens after you eat too much meat and your body is struggling to process it
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.760]   and you get this the meat sweats.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.880]   I can't believe you've never heard this.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.840]   Only in Texas.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.160]   No, I've never not only not heard it.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.080]   I've never had it.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.160]   Well, that's actually probably good for you.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.360]   And after a certain age, you should probably not go to get it.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.280]   The meat sweats are the first sign of a heart attack at my age.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.520]   Yeah, so that's probably true.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.480]   Either you've got the meat sweats or you're dead.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:41.120]   So what I learned from John, who's great, is that in Texas, it ain't the sauce.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.880]   In fact, sauce is kind of deprecated.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.320]   It's the dry rub.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.320]   Yes.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.640]   And he said, test it via he said, get the brisket.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.440]   The only way to know if it's good barbecue is how the brisket is.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   Yes.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.960]   In Texas, we are brisket people.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   I know this.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   I wish I had no.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.160]   And you don't get lean brisket.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   You get the fat.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   That's what he said.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   That's what he said.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:12.080]   He said, you want USDA prime, whatever the highest level is brisket with lots of marbling.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.720]   I didn't even know brisket could be marbled.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:18.920]   I thought the whole point of barbecue was taking the worst meat cuts possible and cooking
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.080]   them long enough so they didn't taste bad.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.480]   But it turns out you can get good brisket.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   Anyone?
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.480]   Did you not get good brisket?
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.880]   No, I didn't know.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.560]   I always get the links and I like links.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   Links.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   So I love this.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.840]   You get that on Texas barbecue.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   I know.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   I'm going back.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   I have to go back.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   I'll see you this weekend.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   I blew it.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   Come hang out.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   I'll take you.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   Oh, no.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   You get brisket.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   Apparently everybody knows except me.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.600]   So I love this response.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:52.160]   This is Kansas City compared to Brooklyn.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   Kansas City on the top, the Brooklyn barbecue you can't get into.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:02.920]   And Sanford Johnson tweets, "I've seen southerners from all walks of life come together to condemn
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.080]   this struggle plate."
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.600]   Brooklyn barbecue.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.440]   It doesn't really look that appealing, does it?
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.800]   And everybody knows barbecue knows that you don't put like, what is this?
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.040]   A dinner roll?
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   Yeah, you want-
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   That's what I was looking at.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.280]   A slice of white bread, baby.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.360]   Slice of Texas toast.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.080]   This is Brooklyn.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.280]   This is Cooper's barbecue in response.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   That is.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   That's a pork.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   What is that?
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   Pork or brisket?
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   That's the brisket?
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   That looks good.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   And they had a sauce, but it was a fresh-
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.280]   I got to go get more barbecue.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.440]   It was a thin kind of vinegary sauce.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.520]   It wasn't an all thick tomato-y sweet sauce.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.160]   It's very good.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.320]   That looks good on a surface tablet.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.320]   Good enough to eat.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   So what's this?
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.320]   Brooklyn barbecue.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.640]   This is silly.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.680]   This is not barbecue.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.600]   This looks like a prisoner's last meal or something.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   Oh, that wouldn't be your last meal.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   That'd be cool.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.520]   This is what you get in solitary.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.840]   Looks like that, yeah.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.240]   I was trying to read this men's fitness article for you on the Meat Sweats.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.080]   There's a men's health has the best articles.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.880]   I swear to God.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.640]   They are the men's fit.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.680]   Because I follow men's health on Twitter.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.840]   It is the link-badiest crap you've ever seen.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.320]   It gets me every time.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.120]   And every time I hit myself, I go and I read the article and I go, "Oh, crap.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.440]   I fell for men's health again."
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   There you go.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.720]   Oh, it's called the Thermic Effect of Feeding, where your body temperature rises after you
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.960]   down a ridiculous amount of food.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.280]   So there you go.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.800]   But, oh, even food and wine has one.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.120]   Yes, the Meat Sweats are real.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.600]   Here's how to survive them.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   Okay.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   Ta-da.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.760]   Now you know more than you want to know about disgusting things.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:57:01.600]   Meanwhile, back in Google Land, France is suing Google and Apple over developer contracts.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.400]   They're seeking fines of two million euros over what it terms abusive contractual terms
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.600]   imposed by the tech giants on startups and developers.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.680]   It's fine to find anything they can.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.280]   So there'll be some of them over parking tickets.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:20.720]   France's finance minister Bruno Lamari says, "As powerful as they are, Google and Apple
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.400]   should not be able to treat our startups and our developers the way they do.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:31.000]   I will therefore be taking Google and Apple to the Paris commercial cart for abusive trade
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.600]   practices."
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.640]   Google says, "We believe our terms can plan.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:46.760]   We're not with French laws and are looking forward to making our case in court."
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.760]   There you go.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.160]   There's the EU story of the day.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:00.720]   Bezos says he's going to spend his, quote, "Amazon lottery winnings on space travel."
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.080]   Does this mean he's going or?
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.000]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   The price.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   He really wants to go, doesn't he?
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   The price.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.440]   Here he is, by the way, eating something I don't even want to know.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.600]   I guess it's an iguana.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   Tony de Guana.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.440]   That picture is going to haunt.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.440]   That is horrible.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.440]   It is.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.440]   Tony de Guanas?
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.440]   Why?
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   Why?
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   Where was he?
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.680]   Somewhere not around here.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.160]   He's just going to be horror's club.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:29.080]   The price of admission to space is very high, said Jeff.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.640]   "I am in the process of converting my Amazon lottery winnings into a much lower price of
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.680]   admission so we can go explore the solar system as they dined on iguana."
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.080]   Maybe it's a delicacy somewhere?
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:48.120]   Well, I got to say, having been to the Galapagos, there are many, many iguanas.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   It's not like there's an iguana shortage.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.520]   In Costa Rica, there are many iguanas.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.520]   Many iguanas.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.760]   But I don't think you should eat them.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.760]   They're nice.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   They're sweet.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.760]   They're kind.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   Are they sweet or not?
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   Or cows?
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   Or cows.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   True.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   Isn't that funny?
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   It's very cultural, isn't it?
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   Pigs are smart.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   I stopped eating pork, which is really hard.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   Because pigs are nice?
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.720]   Because pigs are really smart.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.040]   I started thinking about eating something that was smart.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   I know.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.160]   Maybe you should eat more iguana.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.760]   They're not smart.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.760]   They're lizards.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.760]   Yeah, I really don't.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.080]   I don't want to eat a lizard.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.760]   That just doesn't even look appealing.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.600]   I mean, I had snake, I guess.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.680]   But that was just for fun.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.760]   It would be fine if they hadn't lifted all of the parts on it.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   I know.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   A little bit.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.120]   Let's go back to space travel.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.000]   This is an important moment I think we've got to note here.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.520]   Bezos is definitely...
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   Okay.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.960]   Bezos later declined to clarify how much of his fortune he'd spend on space travel.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:51.600]   But Paul said that the next table said Bezos could spend it all if he leaves enough to
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.800]   take care of his mother.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.120]   Bezos is definitely not leaving mom behind.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.640]   She said she's going into space.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.840]   She's already been in an ocean voyage to recover F1 rocket engines.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   Keep reading.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   This is a funny part.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.400]   The crew made accommodations for her as Bezos recounted from the stage.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.720]   When we first boarded the ship, the Norwegian captain, a very nice guy, he went to me and
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.680]   said, "Mr. Bezos had taken the liberty because of your mother's on board.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.280]   We'd never had a woman on board before, removing all the pornography from the common areas.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.480]   I hope that's okay with you," I said.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.600]   Yeah, it's fine.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   It's good.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   Thank you.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.320]   I did that.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.640]   To be sure, plenty of great women explorers have made up pretty well in a male dominated
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   world anyway.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.440]   They talk about some women there.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   This is Bloomberg technology.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   Bezos loves Earth, too.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.880]   We've sent a lot of probes to every plant in the solar system.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.560]   Believe me, this is the best one.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.800]   I'm glad to hear him say that because Elon acts as if like, "Oh, we're going to save
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.560]   ourselves by going to Mars."
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.320]   Are this a terrible place?
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.280]   Yes.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.920]   I think Elton John said that, but it is.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.800]   It would be very, very hard to make Mars into anything habitable for any reasonable number
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   of people.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:14.040]   It's not Plan B in any normal scenario.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.200]   Let's keep our planet okay.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.880]   The idea of space as a backup to Earth if destroyed is unmotivating," said Bezos.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.400]   "I want a world for my grandchildren's grandchildren to live in.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.360]   I also want a dynamic world.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.920]   A world that is expanding and growing.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.880]   I do not believe in stasis and this planet's finite."
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.600]   That's a good argument for exploring.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.840]   But don't think it's because we're going to all move there.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.120]   I think Jeff has his.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.600]   He's got a good head on his shoulders.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.760]   I think this is a moment where we should talk about a space explorer par excellence.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   We lost today.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.960]   Oh, you're right.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   It's even.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.400]   It's an explorer of the mind.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   The cosmos.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.200]   And the cosmos.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.280]   And the brilliant physicist and really an inspiration, Stephen Hawking, of course, passed away.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:14.080]   So I just put up links to Yuri Milner, who started the space exploration from saying
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.520]   that thousands of little tiny spaceships.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.280]   They put it up on the link.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.720]   He did a tribute to Hawking today.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.600]   And then Tony Hendra, who sat next to Hawking in elementary school.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.760]   I did not know that.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.800]   Or we're editor of Tony Hendra.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.080]   So here's Yuri Milner.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.680]   Yuri Milner, should I read that?
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.240]   Yeah, just a second or third graph.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:45.680]   I was greatly saddened to hear the passing of Stephen Hawking when future historians consider
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.600]   who were the outstanding people of our age.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:57.120]   They will think of Professor Hawking, some of the greatest insights concerning the late.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   You know what?
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   I'm going to have to read this directly.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   I'm reading it.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.040]   I'm trying to read it off the TV screen.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   That's not.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.280]   Let me do that again.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   Where's the link?
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   Where is the link?
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   Facebook.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   Oh, I'll try.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.760]   Albert, we now believe that the universe does not really forget anything.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.760]   And as long as people, oh, they're at one.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.520]   Don't read it off the TV screen.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.720]   I told you, when we're doing physics, his contribution will not be forgotten.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.920]   So that was nice.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   That's good.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.400]   Tony Hendra was former editor of National Lampoon.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   Yes.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.600]   So he too had a tribute.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.080]   Here's reactions to I think I have a link here.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.240]   The Queen sends a message to Hawking's family.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.640]   X wife deeply saddened.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.480]   You saw the wonderful.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   The wonderful movie.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:52.400]   Here's Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.680]   President Obama's tribute.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.640]   That's kind of sweet.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   Oh, this is a picture of President Obama and Hawking's daughter Lucy.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:11.400]   And Obama posted this and said, "Have fun out there among the stars."
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:17.800]   The Queen's brief history of time is a lay person's introduction to deep physics.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.160]   And it is highly recommended.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.560]   You should also watch the movie with Eddie Redmayne playing Stephen Hawking, The Theory
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.560]   of Everything.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.440]   Redmayne said, "We've lost a truly beautiful mind."
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:37.840]   There is an illustrated brief history that I have that I really like Hawking supervised
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.400]   this publication of it.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.160]   It's highly expanded and updated.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.360]   Has lots of great pictures.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.640]   It's $85 in the hardcover, but this I highly recommend.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.480]   There is a less expensive paperback.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.040]   It was really, really gorgeous.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.360]   Now I'm going to have to dig it out.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.640]   Put it on my coffee table.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.760]   So if I may, let me read just a little bit from Dr. Hernandez.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760]   Please.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:13.160]   And Tony says, "Set next to him."
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.200]   Tony says, " Considering the scope of his work, there's something felicitous in his dying
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.520]   on the same day Einstein was born.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.040]   In the space time continuum, birth, death, and dates are infinitely fungible.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.840]   Marvelous if he could somehow also make possible for Hawking to discover that he was also
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.680]   right about God in the afterlife.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.680]   But we will never know.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.960]   I do know this.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.480]   His scrunny kid who sat in front of me has redefined forever the paltry measures we have
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.480]   of what it means to succeed.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.320]   And by his vast additions to the sum of human knowledge, as well as his demonstration of
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.640]   the incalculable power of the human spirit to survive, he has left the world a far better
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.400]   place than most of us ever will."
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   Interesting.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.680]   Especially the part about God since Hawking was a well-known atheist.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.680]   Exactly.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.240]   I think so as Tony I would bet.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.240]   He's believed in an impersonal God but not a creator I think in how he phrased it.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   Wow.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   Thank you for reminding me because that is-
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   I didn't mean to bring the show down, but I think it was really important.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:18.680]   Well, and you know, he led a rich, full life given his illness and his handicap.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:24.520]   I've known two people who have had ALS and the fact that they would survive a year on
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.120]   that horrible disease is amazing.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.120]   Amazing.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.120]   He survived so long on it.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.640]   It was just the problem.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.720]   But the disease and the wheelchair be damned.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.440]   You know, having nothing to do with that.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.520]   He was an amazing man.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.920]   He also died on Pi Day, didn't he?
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   Three, one, four.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   So Einstein-
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.680]   Did he pass yesterday or did he to-
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.560]   Actually, I think they said Monday I think is what they said, but I don't know.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.560]   Oh.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.560]   It might have been Pi Day in the UK.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   It might have been Pi Day by then.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.240]   No, today is Wednesday.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.040]   Yeah, we're geeking.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.080]   But see, this is a problem with time.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.920]   Tell me about time.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.280]   What is the problem with time, Leo?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   It's relative.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.640]   It's all relative.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.360]   Who inherited my Pixel Buds?
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.960]   Did anybody pick those up?
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.320]   I gave those away in the big Leo garage sale.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.880]   Who was that at work?
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.680]   I put all my old stuff that I didn't want to keep out on the conference room table, including
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.560]   the Pixel Buds.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.440]   But they have apparently improved controls for the Pixel Buds, which I just never grew
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.160]   to love.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.280]   You can finally double tap to skip songs.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.240]   Ooh.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.920]   Triple tapping has a new function.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.280]   And finally, an in-ear detection feature will pause your music when you remove the right
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]   earbud.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.920]   These are all features that Apple's--
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.080]   I never get to remember all those things.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   Yeah, I never use them on the AirPods.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080]   But it's nice to have.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:03.120]   You start-- I mean, once you start using them, you kind of-- whatever works for you,
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120]   you'll keep--
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   I'll tell you what I do use.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.280]   I use the Take One Ear Bud out to pause it.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.600]   Because that's a very natural thing.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.360]   Somebody talks to you, you take out an earbud.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360]   It stops, you talk to me.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360]   I never knew that.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.560]   I always thought the music was continuing when I talked to somebody.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.760]   No, it's phenomenal.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.120]   That's actually-- that's an example of where somebody's really spending some energy thinking
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.720]   about how people use stuff and do the right thing.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:31.040]   By the way, Microsoft cut its laptop prices yesterday on Pi Day by 31.4%.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.680]   I wish I'd known.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.880]   That's much more impressive than 3.1%.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.920]   Yeah, it could have been 3.1% percent.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.080]   Let's take a break and talk a little more in just a bit.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.280]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, BuzzMachine.com, what would Google
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.600]   do, public parts, and more.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:09:01.680]   And Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com and her great podcast with Kevin Tofol who's
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.680]   watching today.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:08.800]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:15.200]   Now officially the biggest lender in the United States, number one, according to Inside Mortgage
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.800]   Finance, the number one online mortgage lender, number one in customer satisfaction according
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   to JD Power, number one in my heart because they created Rocket Mortgage, a fully online
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.360]   mortgage approval process.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.720]   No more going to the bank, put on a tie, go on down there.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.560]   The banker goes through a bunch of rig and roll and gives you a big long form to fill
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   out.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.400]   Then you have to go to the attic and you get all the paperwork, your pay stubs and your
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.960]   check statements, call the bank saying, "I need check statements for five years ago and
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.000]   on and on and on and on."
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.760]   And I mean literally, the last time I bought a house four years ago, Lisa and I spent more
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.600]   than a month gathering paperwork to prove we were eligible for the mortgage.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.960]   We got it in the end, but it took us weeks.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.360]   Rocket Mortgage, about eight minutes, eight minutes.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.920]   And you don't have to get off the couch.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.560]   You could be at an open house with your smartphone.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.120]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.000]   Answer a few simple questions you know off the top of your head because they have got
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.360]   trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.040]   You just have to give them permission to get the information.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.720]   They'll get it for you.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.520]   They crunch the numbers and based on your income, your assets and your credit, they tell you
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.240]   the home loans you qualify for.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.440]   You choose the rate, the down payment, the term and boom, you're done.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   Approved.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.600]   Literally at an open house.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.600]   You could just show the realtor.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   We're approved.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600]   We'd like to make an offer.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.200]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.440]   Apply, simply, understand fully.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.360]   And then mortgage confidently.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.560]   Please use that URL.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.160]   That way they know you saw it here.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.960]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.040]   Equal Housing Lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.680]   30, we thank Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:10.240]   We're putting this week in Google on the air, rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.760]   So can I mention one quickly?
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:18.640]   So Google just made a change that now if they know you subscribe to, let's say, the economist
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.880]   or the guardian or the New York Times, it will place that publication in higher and ranking.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   Oh, that's great.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.000]   You know, it's a really, a battle is raging.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.640]   I'm curious what you think about this because you're the journalism expert.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.600]   But it's pretty clear now Apple just bought texture, one of our sponsors, which is the
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600]   magazine app.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.000]   It gives you 200 magazines for 10 bucks a month.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.760]   It was founded by Conde Nast, the big magazine publishers, Conde Nast, Maritis, Maritis, all
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.520]   coming to Rogers.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.160]   So yeah, so it was, it was clearly the magazine companies saying, well, we got to find a digital
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   platform.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.160]   It really was great.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   It worked well.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.000]   Apple bought them, not clear what they're going to do.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.160]   But EQ and an interview said we're going to put some of it in our Apple News app.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.800]   This sounds like Jeff, a commitment from Apple to good journalism.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   Yes.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   Well, what you see happening now is that both Facebook and Google have have committed to
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.200]   trying to help publishers with paywalls and we can debate, you know, how effective paywalls
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.200]   are for every publisher.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.360]   But, but I guess there are no issues.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.520]   The ultimate paywall, right?
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.520]   You have to subscribe.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520]   The magazine is there too.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.840]   So this is, this is now Apple coming in.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.280]   And Apple's of course, help publishers quite some time with paywalls.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.400]   So I think you find that happening all across the board now.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.080]   Is this in some ways, I think it's the response to the fake news thing.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.360]   And I stop a good piece on Monday from Jean-Louis Gesset on his site, the Monday note saying
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.360]   that these companies have to finally admit we are, we are more than a platform.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   We are publishers.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.320]   Well, you know, I'm going to argue against that.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320]   And I wrote about that.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   There's a side effect to it.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.240]   There's a negative side effect because then they're responsible, right?
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   Well, no, that's part of it is you get to the regulation piece.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.320]   But the other part of it is the expectation that sets for what the Internet is.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:16.000]   When you call the Net on a platform, a publisher, it brings to mind a packaged, edited, polished
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   product.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.400]   And the Internet is not that.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:25.720]   And so, you know, as I like to say, the Internet is not the New York Times, it's Times Square.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.520]   And so when we try, when we in media try to put it in our square hole, the round peg
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.440]   in our square hole, we set this expectation of what it is.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.080]   And then what happens is when somebody schmutses on the Internet, then the regulators come
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.440]   and say, oh, the Internet's ruined.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   It's ruined in society.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   It's ruining everything.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.640]   And the moral panic ensues.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:48.080]   So I argue strenuously that it is not a publisher and that that is an old style, old institutional
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.840]   way to look at things and it informs nothing to put them in our box.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.080]   Are you arguing that though, just because you're worried about governmental interference or
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.880]   because they truly aren't publishers?
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   Because they truly aren't publishers.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.720]   There's something new and we miss the opportunity to know what they really are.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.760]   There's something in between platform and publisher.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.080]   And we set expectations that are wrong for the Internet.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.200]   The Internet's about speech.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:16.240]   And just the whole notion of scale, I wrote this the other day, that it's the scale of
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.160]   the Net and the platforms that enables everyone to talk to anyone.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.640]   It's also that same scale that makes it impossible to package it and clean it up and find that
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.840]   one ad with rubles because the scale is just so gigantic and the scale is good and the
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.040]   scale makes it hard.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.360]   But that's why we shouldn't think, oh, this is like putting out Time magazine.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.360]   They should be able to clean this up.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.360]   No.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   And it's an entirely different thing at a different scale with different use.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.840]   And so no, damn it, they're not publishers.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:56.560]   Well, I'm glad that they're supporting good journalism.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.200]   It sounds like they're supporting good journalism by supporting publishers, however.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.200]   Yes.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.760]   And they're also, but you have Facebook trying to, we've talked about that often, Google
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.840]   is looking at the authority, reliability and quality of search results.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:15.480]   Facebook is now looking at trying to bring back quality news.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:22.600]   You saw the news that Twitter put out an RFP to get help to figure out how Twitter affects
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.360]   the health of the public conversation.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.400]   So they're all now taking a stand.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:37.480]   Facebook today banned the far right British party and its leaders for hate speech.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.400]   This is them trying to find standards.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.560]   We valued the openness of the Net before.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.240]   And we all, and people like me and you fought for the openness of the Net.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.840]   And we would open.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.560]   But then people like Andrew Keene said, it's the cult of the amateur, all these amateur
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560]   stuff.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]   He was kind of right.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.800]   Wait a minute now, he was kind of right.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.240]   All these, all these people are going to flood in.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.440]   And the problem with completely democratized media is, yeah, it gives everybody a voice.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.560]   And unfortunately, it gives a much more powerful voice to a tiny minority with vile thoughts.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.560]   Well, that's because we let them.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.840]   That's because we, because we, the system is architected and crop properly.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.080]   That doesn't mean that openness is wrong.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:17.000]   You know, I went, I went to see a Black Panther a couple of nights ago, which by the way,
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.280]   I still haven't seen it.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   You must see it.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   Oh, good.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   It's so good.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   It's, and it's good.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.680]   I mean, it's a good movie.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   It's good.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.080]   It's good Marvel comic stuff, but it's good to me for political reasons.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:35.920]   I thought it was very interesting because very strong women without being, you know, emasculating
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:44.240]   or angry, but just being women that are strong and smart and effective and funny.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.040]   And then it showed African Americans, Africans, but also African Americans in a very, very
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.200]   positive, powerful light.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.880]   I didn't know this, but Ta-Nehisi Coates has been writing the most recent Black Panther
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.280]   comic books I had known.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   Yes.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.440]   And you know what he's writing next?
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   What?
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.440]   Captain America.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   Awesome.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.640]   So I thought he's nervous about it.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.960]   But I thought I'm sitting here watching this and I remind me, hey, how powerful, what a
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.360]   powerful platform movies are because that movie is going to be seen.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.040]   It's already a billion dollar movie.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.840]   It'll probably end up being the highest grossing movie.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.000]   Certainly of the year, maybe of the decade, maybe of all time.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.280]   I mean, it's, it's going to be huge.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.920]   It's going to be seen by white people all over this country and by people of all colors
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.960]   all over the world.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:39.280]   And I think that that is going to have a very strong positive effect for human rights.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   And so I was, but then what it made me think is it's so powerful because the people using
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.920]   it know how to use it.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.240]   And, and it's, and there's so much power in some of these platforms that it's okay that
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.080]   it's not fully democratized.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.160]   I'm glad the trolls can't make a $50 million movie.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:06.560]   Seriously, Steve Bannon made movies, but no one saw them because they weren't good.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.920]   Well, there's, there's that, but there's also kind of the, oh, the acorn videos, the
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.320]   what they do is they, they don't take Hollywood in.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.160]   You could argue actually that what was it?
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.360]   Mel Gibson's passion of Christ was kind of.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.600]   But I mean, honestly, it's not nearly as that those things are minor.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.840]   They're not as damaging as the kind of dialogue that goes on on Twitter.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840]   Gone with the wind.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.680]   I mean, you could argue that up until now we've had movies that have denigrated.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.200]   Oh, I agree with that.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   No, I'm not saying that movies are good.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.120]   I'm just saying it is, is such a powerful platform that it's that I think it's not a
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.280]   bad thing that there've been gatekeepers maybe.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.120]   Well, but look, look now admittedly, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, there were, it was
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.480]   a bad thing that there were gatekeepers because it stopped other people's stories from being
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.480]   told.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   Right.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   Exactly.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   I'm not getting told now because of YouTube.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:06.200]   No, I think, I think that the internet enabled so many more voices to be heard and valued.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.600]   It's because that that helped.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.960]   This is the culmination of years of democracy.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.800]   In other words, so I'm, yeah, Carson is pointing out he's, he's throwing an unverbal argument
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.120]   and he's putting student videos from Parkland.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120]   Amen.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.520]   Today, a lot of students walked out of classrooms all over the country to protest gun laws and
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.000]   to urge gun safety.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.160]   And so this is a good, this is a really good example of, yeah, you're right.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.160]   You're right.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.160]   You're right.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.060]   So you could say, you could, it would be fair to say that Black Panther wouldn't exist
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.960]   if it hadn't been for.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.200]   I don't want to be deterministic, but I think that it has a additive effect.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.720]   I'm doing a lot of research right now, the big pile of books on mass society and mass
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.720]   culture.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.560]   And if you go back to 1960, the fear and the dread of what television was doing to the
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.600]   mind and it was all awful.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.760]   And if you go back farther, movies were doing it.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.440]   And of course, you go back farther, it was eventually way back.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.600]   It was books.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.720]   And, and this notion that we are incapable and we need these gatekeepers, we need high
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.600]   culture and high culture has been ruined by this, this low stuff and it's kind of an
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.120]   anti-Americanism.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.440]   And so we're seeing the same thing now.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.760]   That's what, that's what Andrew Keene does to the extent, right?
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.320]   It's the snobbish, the leadish.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.080]   So it's in a nutshell, what Andrew Keene said.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   Yes.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.880]   And we're trying to figure out, but what we're doing is this is why what Facebook and Google
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.440]   and Twitter are doing is important.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.600]   They're now for the first time trying to realize that quality matters and they got to figure
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.240]   out WTF quality.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.240]   And they don't know.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.240]   And I don't know either.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.480]   But they're trying to say a barrage of crap by people who are manipulating the platform
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   is no good.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.880]   So we're going to have to find some way to variate here and some way to figure that out.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.880]   And they're just beginning.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.320]   And it's going to be a hard process because they're going to go too far and satire is
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:59.280]   getting killed in Germany and elsewhere now because of the new laws, but they'll figure
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   it out.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.760]   They'll get there, we'll get there, we'll say this and that's a crappy experience for
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   us and that's a good experience.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.920]   So give me more of the good.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.920]   Okay, you're right.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.480]   Oh, I'm not, but I was all excited because I thought this is an example of the power
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.600]   of a mainstream motion picture to change.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.200]   I think to change the minds of millions of people.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.880]   But Stacy's point is really right.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.240]   The subtle stories that never got told.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.600]   I mean, as a woman watching movies and having my daughter who is way more alert to sexism
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:35.000]   than I am, there's so many movies that she is like, yeah, why would I watch this?
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   It's crap.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.040]   Well, you know, it's crap because it's subjected to all these Disney princesses and yeah.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.360]   Well, okay, all general.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.440]   I mean, my generation was subjected to Disney princesses.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.920]   I'm glad she's saying all the words to the Ariel song.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.680]   But I'm just glad that she's that she's sensitized to it.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.680]   That's good.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.280]   That's my doing.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   Good job, mom.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.880]   We don't have a lot of boring conversations about gender inequality at our house.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.360]   Yeah, it is a good movie.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   You should go see it, Jeff.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   I can't wait to.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.520]   I'm dying to where I really want to watch is what's the cult Lenin is dead?
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.200]   Oh, I was I thought you were going to say annihilation because I'm actually looking to
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   buy tickets for tonight.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.200]   I'm like, oh, Stalin Stalin.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   Thank you.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.000]   They're both dead, but Stalin is dead.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   It's a movie.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Yeah, Stalin is dead.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.880]   Oh, you see the trailer?
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.240]   It's called death of the death of Stalin.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.240]   That's a Stalin.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.240]   Oh, I can't wait to see it.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.240]   Hilarious trail.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.640]   It's a political satire.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.880]   Oh, Armando, you knew you knew she wrote it.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.680]   Oh, it's I love him.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.680]   Great.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.280]   He writes great political satire.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.520]   He's one of my favorites.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.120]   I was wondering if we'd ever see another movie from him.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.720]   He did he did the movie that TV show that VEEP was based on.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.040]   Oh, that would be nice.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.360]   Yeah, he is what was the name of it.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:23:00.320]   I'm trying to remember the thick of it, which is a fabulous.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   Yes.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.600]   In the loop with was such a good movie.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   Yeah, he's.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.640]   Oh, I can't wait to see it.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   That will be great.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   Okay.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   Well, no, we don't have to show trailer.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   Everybody should go see that.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.240]   And then what else else do you see?
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.240]   So annihilation, you're going to see that.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240]   What's annihilation?
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.320]   What's that all about?
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:25.120]   That's it's a remake of a not a horror, a sci-fi trilogy.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.760]   The movie is supposedly very different.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   Stars Natalie Portman.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.560]   They go adult book.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   Is this another hunger?
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.320]   No, no, this is not a.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   This is a different dystopian thing.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:42.600]   They go into this thing called the shimmer where reality is different.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.360]   And something about alien life was made.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360]   Oh, this looks really good.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.760]   You're going to see that tonight, huh?
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   I think so.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   Yeah, nice.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.480]   It's like Andrew's got plans to do something else.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.800]   So I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, what's it?
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:55.000]   You told me to get the book autonomous.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Yes.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.360]   So I want to know I'm reading.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.480]   I'm loving it and we're interviewing.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.480]   Annalee on Friday.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.040]   Do you want to join us?
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.680]   Oh, um, Friday, 3 p.m. Pacific, which would be 5 p.m.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.880]   Your time.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   Think about it.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   I'll think about it.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   You can Skype in.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.880]   Annalee knew it's you could meet her and we'd talk about the book.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:19.280]   And she's been like a hero of mine because she found it I09 way back in the day.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.640]   She's like super awesome.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.720]   You want to get on that show, don't you?
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720]   Come on.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.720]   I know you got life.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.120]   But my daughter's been out of.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   She's been at downtown or downtown.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.400]   She's been out of town.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.640]   She's been downtown since Tuesday and I've got to go get her.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.000]   Yeah, basically she's been used in some Sunday.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   She's been used in some Sunday.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.920]   Yeah, because usually we're busy.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920]   My parents, you know what?
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   They live at Houston.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920]   They want to see her.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.400]   Why doesn't your daughter join us and interview her?
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.840]   She has not read the book.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.840]   It's okay.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.840]   She can get that.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.600]   You feel like some of the themes in the book might be kind of adult.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.720]   A little, well, it's not at all.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.000]   It's about big pharma.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.720]   It's about some amazing autonomous and indentured robots.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.160]   The robots are amazing.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.920]   Very interesting issues that she raises.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.720]   She is reading what's it called?
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.000]   Zahara Zahara, The Windseeker, which is a really good-looking book.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.120]   Yes, I've seen the cover.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.680]   And I don't know how to pronounce the writer's name.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.680]   Nidi Okafor?
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.880]   Well, it's an older book.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:32.360]   At least 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC Friday.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.840]   If you are fans of Analynn, new ones or want to find out more from the Fanning Editor
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.880]   of I09 about her new novel, this must be your first novel.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   Right?
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.160]   It's a first novel, but not her first book.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160]   Really good.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   Autonomous.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.840]   Great side, right?
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:53.800]   She wrote, "How will escape extinction or how we're going to evolve after extinction?"
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.360]   Happy thoughts.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   The Great Migration.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.800]   It's something about how we'll survive after the world goes nuclear or life ends.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   Sorry.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.000]   I'm not talking about Red Sparrow, which I don't think you should see.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   I saw it.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.640]   I love the books.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.280]   The books are amazing.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.200]   I've read the entire trilogy.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]   They are so good.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.200]   I cannot recommend them enough.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:23.480]   The movie is like a gore fest of beating up on Jennifer Lawrence.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.760]   I don't know why she wanted to do that.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.240]   I could not watch.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.000]   It was so like, she's God.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   It looked painful.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   I agree.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   So don't watch it.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   It's really awful.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   But read the books.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   The books are great.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   Are you disappointed?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   We were all excited about the post.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.200]   You've disappointed that no Academy Awards for the post.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.000]   Those people have a piece in time.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.320]   It was a piece in time.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.520]   I don't think it was one of the greatest movies.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520]   I've ever made it.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.200]   It was a very good movie, but I don't think it was.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.000]   I think it was a short-list point.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   It was good.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   It was a short-list point.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   Not stupid.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   Water was good, although it was a little like the creature from the Black Glaecon.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   But it was good.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.800]   I would have liked less rubber costume more.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800]   But the rest of it was fine.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.200]   I really like him as a director.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Anyway.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.920]   Since we're doing entertainment corner.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.920]   Yes.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.720]   The cold opened last week's Saturday Night Live.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720]   Didn't see it.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.720]   It was amazing.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.720]   Which one was this?
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.720]   Oh.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.720]   It was Mueller breaks up with collusion.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.720]   Yes.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.720]   Okay.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:27.720]   I will watch it.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.720]   We won't do it here.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:29.720]   We won't do it here.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720]   Watch it when you have a chance.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.720]   It was really daring and wildly, weirdly different.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]   Oh, nice.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.920]   Do you watch you stay up late on Saturday?
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.920]   No.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.920]   No one does.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   No one does.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   How are it strong time?
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.720]   No one does that anymore.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.960]   They have a YouTube channel.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   I know.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.880]   That's really, you know, it's funny because when YouTube first started, one of the things
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.000]   that almost killed it was NBC.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.080]   It was the thing that made it was clips like taking a box from Saturday Night Live.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.600]   And one of the things that almost killed it was NBC furiously suing them.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.200]   And CBS did too.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.560]   They've all been dead.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.320]   And but then it turned then I guess they backed down because they realized, you know, this
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.360]   is actually pretty good promotion.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.240]   More people are watching Saturday Night Live than ever have before.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.160]   And yet I have to say there's no reason to watch Saturday Night Live.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.320]   And they get to add revenue from, well, if they got a whole generation, they wouldn't
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.320]   get to get to add.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   I guess that's a good promotion.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.480]   And it's just the way of the world you can't you can't.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   What are you going to do?
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   What are you going to do?
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   You can't.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.480]   You can't.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   You can't.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.000]   Your daughter runs around saying like a boss all the time.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.440]   Like, and I'm like, have you, have you seen that Anna?
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.240]   Well, it's just because it's got part of the culture, but that's it.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.240]   It has become it.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.640]   She's like, no, no, I haven't.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.480]   There's somebody who sings a song on Animal Jam, which is one of the games she plays.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   I'm like, okay.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.600]   Well, if you happen to see it and you want to talk to me afterwards, you know, let me
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   know.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.560]   She is one lucky sixth-clater.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.760]   That's all I could say.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.040]   She's got a good mom.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:03.400]   Look, look, you know what moms like to do in my neck of the woods?
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.360]   Here we go.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.480]   I've been waiting for this.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.160]   I whined and pleaded and begged.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.000]   Do you know about these guys?
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   Yes.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.400]   No, I knew about them because I saw Lisa.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   I'm a mom.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   I'm the target market apparently.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.840]   No, Lisa bragged about about.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   I don't know where to put it.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.120]   I'm going to put it in this sponsor.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.280]   This is a great sponsor.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.720]   We all sent now you're in New Jersey, which has very restrictive rules about sending wine,
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.760]   but I think you could still get wink because wink is a winemaker.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.640]   They're not a wine distributor, so you're getting it from the winemaker.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.920]   And actually it was pretty smart of them.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.320]   Wink, W-I-N-C, which I guess stands for wine club, is so much better than a wine club.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:53.120]   It is a wine club, but it's, I mean, look, this is for people who probably, you know,
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.240]   well, for sure over 21 and probably drink wine a little bit, but maybe you'd like to
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.920]   find a better wine or maybe you're drinking the same wine every night or every day, every
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.080]   week and you'd like to try something else or you'd like to get a little more sophisticated
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.240]   about your, I'm trying to find a place to put this.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.720]   I wanted to show you the box because it comes in this nice box for bottles a month.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.720]   You can skip any month.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.720]   You can choose the bottles.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:22.480]   Let me actually start with the wine quiz because that's kind of the fun, the fun part
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.480]   about wink.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:28.280]   You can see our Y, W-I-N-C dot com slash twig, okay?
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.480]   You can go right now.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.880]   And we of course have a deal.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.400]   You're going to get $20 off your first shipment, but the fun part about this-
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.680]   What is that code, Leo?
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.120]   What is that code?
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.680]   Just try wink dot com slash twig.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.680]   Twig.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.960]   You'll, in fact, if you go there, you'll see at the top it says your $20 discount will
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.160]   be applied to checkout just by going there.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.920]   But here's the onboarding that I really love and you can do this if you want.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.400]   How do you like your coffee?
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   Strong and black?
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:00.120]   Mild but nothing in it with cream and/or sugar frappuccinoed.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.920]   I don't like coffee.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.120]   Jeff, what are you picking?
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.120]   I was just going back here.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.120]   How about you Stacy?
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   I'll say, what do you like?
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.960]   I say with sugar.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   This is me too.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.160]   Cream and/or sugar.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.400]   Only sugar, but I will drink it black if I have to.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   Okay.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   How about you, Jeff?
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.400]   A mild but nothing in it.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.400]   All right.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.400]   Well, you know what?
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   This is just a test.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   Do you like salt?
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400]   I put it on everything.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.400]   I use it sometimes, but it bothers me.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.400]   Food's under salted.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.880]   I like the taste, but I don't miss it.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:29.880]   It's not on my food.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.880]   Take it or leave it.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.640]   Don't really like the salty stuff.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   You Jeff put it on everything.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.640]   How about you Stacy?
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.480]   I'm used it sometimes bothers me when it's not salted.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.480]   Citrus.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.000]   The more mouth buckering the better.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   Like it.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   Don't love it.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   Drink the occasional glass of OJ.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   Man.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   Nope, not at all.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.760]   You get what we're going here, right?
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.200]   Do you like earthy flavors like mushrooms?
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.200]   And black truffles.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.200]   Yes.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200]   Yes.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.200]   More or less eat dirt.
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.200]   More or less eat dirt.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   Who doesn't love truffles, right?
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.040]   Blackberries, raspberries, blueberries.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   You love berries.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.080]   Do you like the flavors, but you like them?
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.080]   Yeah, I like that one.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.080]   Eat them raw.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   All right.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.080]   Now, don't think wine yet, but do you?
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   I don't like them too much.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.080]   Yeah, Barry.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080]   Yeah, I know what you say.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.080]   I like them wine with a little pepper.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.880]   Oh, yeah, you like a little pepper?
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.880]   All right.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.400]   So based on what I just kind of made up here, I gave hybrid answers from the two of you.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.800]   So this may not be your package.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.400]   This is the Stacy and Jeff of Malcomation.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   All right.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   So now you're going to build your box.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.240]   You can get, by the way, you get, if you like, you say, I only want red, you can have
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.240]   four reds and no whites.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.560]   You can have one white, the two whites, three whites, you get to choose.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.320]   So let's do half and half.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:39.680]   So it's recommending the 2016 Rosobscura red blend.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.040]   A pause, ordinary red blend.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.320]   The Summerwater Rosé, which by the way is not a rosé fan, but when it gets hot out,
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.080]   you're going to want this chilled.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.960]   And they've recommended a cider, the Envy, Plavin cider.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.120]   They do some ciders.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:57.200]   They make all of this themselves all over the world.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.280]   So this is from, this is called Cape Route.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.560]   It's from Western Cape in South Africa.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.240]   So this is South African white.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.720]   We have a red that we really, really love.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.880]   A Pino that's in the Santa from the Santa Barbara area.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:14.080]   They pick the grapes at midnight.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.280]   Literally, they pick them at night.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.600]   This is very good too. I've had this 2016 Pino from Santa Barbara.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.520]   Here's the one, I think this is the field theory.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.360]   The field theory comes in a cool looking bottle.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:32.120]   You can see it and it is, this, you would know this maybe it's a Blaufrankisch.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.200]   It's a German style, Blaufrankisch.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.880]   And it is the, oh my gosh, this is delicious.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.840]   So here's the deal with Wink.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.160]   You sign up, you're going to get, these prices are amazing.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.960]   Now admit it, it's not too bucked chuck, but this is really great wine from the wine.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:49.960]   13 dollar bottles.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:50.960]   Yes.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.720]   That tastes like 60 dollar bottles.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.520]   My rule is under 15 bucks.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.640]   This, these taste like 60 to a hundred dollar bottles.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.240]   And by the way, you can go and buy individual bottles or, you know, case, if there's something
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.800]   you like, we bought a case of the field theory.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.560]   They work with top wine makers and growers from around the world to make their own wine.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.880]   Each month there are new delicious wines like the very popular, as we get closer to the
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.200]   hot months, Summerwater Rose.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.480]   They also partner with, as you can see, local artists to make beautiful labels.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.720]   They're all works of art.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.800]   Shipping is covered.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.360]   And if you taste it and you don't like it, don't worry.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.680]   You don't have to send it back.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:32.440]   I asked them, I said, wait a second, I said, no, no, no, we don't want it back.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   Just pour it out, give it to a friend.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.080]   We'll send you a new bottle of something you'll love.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   No questions asked.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.160]   They just go, no problem.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.520]   It's on its way.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:45.200]   So sit back and relax or celebrate with Wink.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.200]   We have become Wink.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.920]   We had a big box the other day.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.920]   We went down.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.040]   We actually went down to Marina Del Rey a couple of weeks ago.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.360]   I wanted to meet the wine maker.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.120]   And he told me some really interesting, hi, here I am in Sonoma County.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.360]   I've been here for 20 years, one of the prime wine growing regions of California, of the
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.960]   world.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.120]   And he told me some stuff about wine.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   I did not know.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.760]   For instance, there are a lot of places where people take their grapes and make their own
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.320]   wine, even though they don't have wineries.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.760]   I did, it's very common.
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.840]   And that Wink will do that.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.440]   They make their wines all over with a grapes bottle.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.320]   Oh, you know, there's a place in Austin that she makes your own wines.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.320]   Even in New Jersey.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.320]   You get to New Jersey one.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   Yeah, I had no idea.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   It's just a joke, but yes.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.840]   Well, I don't think they can get deliveries of everything except the champagne.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840]   Oh, there you go.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:36.960]   Yeah, New Jersey has a among the most restrictive laws on wineshipments, but they'll tell you
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.240]   once you put your address in whether you can get it or not.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.360]   In most cases, you can because they make their wine.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.160]   So even the most restrictive states like New Jersey, if you're buying from the winemaker,
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160]   it's okay.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.000]   They just don't want, I guess you know what it is?
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.360]   It's the distributor lobby.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.360]   Yeah, it's the lobby.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360]   Yes, it is.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360]   Are the state licensing boards depending on...
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.520]   Same reason you can't have a Tesla showroom in Texas.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.640]   You know, it's just the incumbents.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.240]   You have a showroom, you just can't have a dealership.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.760]   Oh, pardon me.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.000]   Look, get wink.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   And it's a...
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.560]   I mean, if you aren't drinking great wine, it's not...
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.720]   Look, four bottles a month.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:19.520]   I'm not talking about every night, but getting that nice date night, Saturday night, if you
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.600]   go and visit friends, bringing them a bottle of this, we get lots more invitations out now
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.520]   because we bring them bottles of field theory.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.760]   This is so good.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:37.880]   Trywink.com, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com/twig, $20 off your first order.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:38.880]   You're going to love it.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:39.880]   I really...
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.320]   This is one of my favorite sponsors.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   They're all my favorites.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.320]   They're like my children.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.360]   I love them all, but wink.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   My mouth is watering.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.960]   I want to do my wink.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.760]   I'm like, "How long...
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.760]   When are we done with this show?"
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:55.760]   We're going to send you both.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.560]   If we can figure it out, I think we can.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.560]   We'll send you both a little...
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.560]   Oh, you do.
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.560]   Something special from Wigot.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.560]   I think they...
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.560]   I think they...
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.560]   They're reality.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.560]   There it is.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.560]   Do you like Pinos?
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.560]   I do.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.280]   It's like a Pinos.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.280]   It's a little...
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.840]   It's a little fruity from what you described your taste.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.880]   I think you would like the field theory, but don't...
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.800]   We'll send you some.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   Okay.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.800]   Any stories I missed?
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.800]   I missed a ton of...
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.800]   Hold on a second.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.800]   Because we were wandering all over the place and I...
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800]   We walked into entertainment.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800]   I know.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   Sorry.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800]   We were in the territory.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.120]   Facebook is streaming 25 Major League Baseball afternoon games.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.960]   The games you probably wouldn't see normally.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.920]   Estimates are about $30 to $35 million.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.760]   Not that expensive.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.560]   I think it's for Facebook an excuse to try live broadcasting.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560]   Let's just see what happens.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560]   They're all trying to figure it out.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560]   They all wanted them.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.600]   They said Twitter, Facebook, everyone wants to do it.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   Let's see.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.240]   Oh, Android Wear...
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240]   Who's still wearing Android Wear?
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.120]   Because I saw this and I was like...
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   No.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.120]   Really, they needed more than a name change.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   I got one.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.520]   I haven't opened yet because we only had $135.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.880]   Apple Watch just ate the universe.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:13.680]   Well, I'm an Android user and I use a Fitbit instead.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.080]   Do you like these new...
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.680]   What do you think of these new Fitbits?
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.360]   This is their attempt to compete with Apple.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.400]   They're using some of the stuff they got from Pebble, I suspect.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.880]   Not the iconic, but the new one that just came out.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.960]   Yeah, the ladies one is what they...
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.440]   It's awfully big.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.760]   They said they made it smaller.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.760]   I like my...
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.120]   I have a charge too and I like it.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.240]   It's a good form factor.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.040]   It does everything I need it to be.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.840]   It's the Fitbit Versa.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:41.840]   And it's really...
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.840]   It's the Fitbit Versa.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.800]   I don't want to say dying gas, but they are really...
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.800]   They are starting to lose...
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.000]   Everybody's starting to lose market share to Apple, unfortunately.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.840]   I like to see competition and you're right.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.320]   Well, I would like to see competition because I'm an Android user.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.920]   Yeah, what do Android people do?
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.920]   Wear OS?
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   No.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.920]   Android Wear?
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.920]   No.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.920]   Well, maybe you try this.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.920]   The Versa's 200 bucks.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.920]   Yeah, it's fairly expensive.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.920]   That's kind of a lot more than I want to spend on.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:13.640]   It's basically an activity in sleep tracker and a heart rate tracker for me.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640]   So...
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.640]   I don't know.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.640]   Well, we'll get a review.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   We'll let you know.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.160]   Yeah, it just looks awfully big, but maybe it's...
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.920]   Maybe they have sizes.
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.920]   It works with Apple, Android, and Windows phone.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.040]   Oh, it's a focus on women's health.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.040]   So they're going to have a...
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.040]   Are they period tracking?
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.040]   All right.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.600]   So I got the misfit vapor for 140 bucks.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.760]   The misfit's not bad.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.920]   I used misfit trackers before that.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:45.920]   I haven't opened it up yet.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.920]   It's been here for three months.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.160]   They were bought by a fossil.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160]   Ah.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.160]   So...
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.160]   Oh.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160]   Oh.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:59.320]   Well, but really the story seems to be that wearables with the exception of Apple's watches
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.240]   are not doing all that well.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.440]   It's not a great category.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.000]   I think people don't need watches for one thing.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.760]   I actually missed my watch.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.040]   I never was one to look at my phone because it was always in my bag.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.320]   So I always like looking at my wrist to see what time it is.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.000]   You know what's been the difference for me is the always-ons notifications of my...
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   Pixel.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.520]   That's something, by the way.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.520]   It's a great difference.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:29.840]   Apple still has it figured out how to keep the watch on, how to tell time all the time.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.720]   They just can't seem to do that.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:35.240]   So that's a little bit of a drawback.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.080]   The always-on is very nice on the Pixel.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.400]   I mean, I could see what time it is on both my Samsung and my Google phones right here.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.080]   I can just look at it.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080]   So you're right.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.840]   Well, who needs a watch?
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.840]   Except it's your purse.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.840]   It's your purse.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:49.840]   It makes sense.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:50.840]   It's in your purse or something like that.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.840]   You're pocketing.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.440]   I am the weird person who doesn't walk around with her phone.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:59.040]   Don't you notice that when you go to...
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040]   Is it my...
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.960]   I don't go to a lot of meetings, but when I go to meetings, it seems kind of...
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.280]   The regret everybody puts their phone on their table in front of them like that, right?
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.600]   Well, if I don't have...
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600]   No, because I mean...
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.600]   No.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.600]   If I don't have my phone...
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600]   Nice people turn it over, but I don't.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.320]   Oh, you're that guy.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.400]   You know, when you're out to eat or dinner table, the phone is not even around.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400]   I'm old school.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.400]   Good for you.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.400]   I just...
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   I don't...
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.400]   We have...
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   We have things that great.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.000]   Michael, 15-year-old, will sit at the phone with a table like eating dinner with a phone
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.800]   like this and Lisa is put the phone away.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.480]   Actually, she starts to take it and goes, "No."
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.200]   He puts it in his lap and then he spends the rest of the dinner going, "Oh, come on."
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.600]   And then he's in his lap.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.320]   Then he's going to put the phone away and then it gets in the pocket.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.320]   And he's...
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320]   But he's very squirrely.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:52.720]   There, I think I saw something on Medium about the dark side of digital persuasion and how
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.080]   it's affecting kids.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.000]   I think Mark Benioff tweeted it.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.480]   Everybody's talking about that, right?
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.480]   Everybody's talking about...
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480]   You know what?
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:05.040]   I just put a quote in today from my research about the addiction of television and movies
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.800]   and how awful it was.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.200]   There is something to see now.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.800]   People are going to movies every week now.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.800]   I can't believe it.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.120]   No, if you look at what Netflix is talking about doing with badges for completing shows...
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120]   Oh, please.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.120]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.800]   These kind of efforts, they do have an effect.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.000]   That's why those shows start up after the first show ends.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]   They start writing to another show.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000]   They don't want to give you a chance to stop.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.800]   And Jeff, I know you're going to call it techno panic.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.360]   Sociologist van den Haag.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.920]   One may turn to the mass media when lonely or bored, but mass media, once they become
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.320]   a habit, impair the capacity for meaningful experience.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.000]   The habit feeds on itself, establishing an ambitious circle as addictions do.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.720]   They lessen people's capacity to experience life itself.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.720]   But Jeff, would you disagree with that?
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.720]   Watch what you're telling me with that.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:56.720]   Wait a minute, Jeff.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.720]   Isn't that true?
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.720]   No.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:04.080]   To the degree that you do it, if you spent five hours a night watching TV, would that not,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.840]   in fact, have that exact...
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.840]   Oh.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.840]   No?
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.840]   Yes.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.840]   Oh.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:12.280]   What happens to the dinner?
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.840]   There are so many times when we're out to eat, we look around and there's whole families
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.840]   just doing this.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840]   And it's distress.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.720]   Maybe they're talking to their other families.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.520]   Well, yes.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.520]   If someone has a family that is not supportive of them, but wouldn't you like to have the
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.120]   chance to establish that relationship with your family?
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.120]   Sure.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:39.320]   But I think this notion that we're now putting phones in the same category as cocaine is
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.920]   a definite case of moral panic.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.920]   Sorry about that.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.040]   I don't think I'm putting it in the case of...
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040]   Some are.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.040]   Okay.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.040]   Some are.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.680]   But I do think this is something what we need to look at.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.720]   We need to question and we need to say, "Hey, do we really want to gamify binge watching
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.400]   for our kids to encourage them to do more?"
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.960]   Netflix does, sure.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.240]   But do I as a parent think that's a great idea?
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:03.400]   Kids, get your secret Dakota ring.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Yes.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   I mean, did people...
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.400]   It's just they've gotten better at it, Jeff.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.400]   It's gotten...
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.200]   It's been weaponized on it.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.680]   You not need to not think that it could even be consumed.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.080]   Eating a bunch of sugary cereal has actually caused your generation a lot of problems to
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.560]   get those secret Dakota rings.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.280]   So I do think this is actually...
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.480]   That you found that's how we screw up the world.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.960]   It's the damn secret Dakota rings.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.760]   I'm just saying.
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:33.760]   And you know what, Stacy?
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.480]   It was cracker jack secret prizes and the disappointment that comes led to a generation
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.480]   of cynics.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.520]   It might have.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:43.520]   It might have, Jeff.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.520]   It doesn't mean it didn't.
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.120]   Because the prizes were really crappy.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.360]   You always hoped you were going to get something good.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.960]   Zanep, you realized that life was screwed up.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.960]   Zanep too ficky.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.280]   YouTube, the great radicalizer said something...
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.960]   She's observed something I've observed.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.520]   I've been saying for a long time, one of the reasons you get people like Logan Paul on
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:06.200]   YouTube is there is a pressure towards extreme video.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.000]   I mean, there has been on TV too.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.400]   We wouldn't have Morton Downey Jr. without it.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.360]   But she says, you know, she tried this out as an experiment.
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.720]   That's all we can do since Google doesn't say how their YouTube algorithms work.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.720]   It's a very insightful piece.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:20.720]   It's a very what?
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.840]   It's a slight full piece.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.840]   You agree?
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.080]   Well, yeah, because what it says is this notion that, "Oh, you like that?
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.040]   I'll give you something that's even more like that."
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.040]   More extreme.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040]   It's something that's very easy to exploit.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.040]   Right.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.640]   It's something that is more like that.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:37.760]   So it's the nature of the YouTube algorithm, and it works, so they wouldn't do it because
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.760]   it's...
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.640]   I don't think these people are evilly planning this, plotting it in their human layers.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.320]   I think when it gets exploited badly.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.240]   But I do think that engineers create algorithms that optimize for the thing the company wants,
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.360]   which is more engagement, more viewing, and that's why you get algorithms.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.440]   And then a player towards more and more extreme terms.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.440]   Makers and turn exploit that.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.400]   And the funny example she gave is you watch vegetarian videos and it gives you vegan.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.440]   It's more extreme in every direction.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.840]   They value relevance, and relevance is a factor that can get played very easily.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.680]   And so I don't think it's fully true that we think, "Let's get the whole country into
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.680]   craziness."
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:18.680]   I don't think they're doing that.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.680]   No, I don't think they're doing that.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.320]   But it's having that...
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.560]   Do you not agree that it is potentially at least dangerous in its loyalty to that?
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.000]   There are unintended consequences.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]   There are consequences.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.200]   Well, I think it's intended by, but not necessarily by the platform in all cases, it's by the
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.880]   maker of the far right and far left crazy stuff.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:37.880]   They recognize how good the platform is.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:41.040]   But the platform's complicit, just as it was after the podcast, I'm going to...
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040]   So I'm going to...
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.920]   I would agree that it's completely unknowingly.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.760]   I'm not saying that Google and Facebook are...
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.400]   But they're optimizing.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.240]   They're engineers.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.720]   Just as the engineers at World of Warcraft optimize for maximum playing time, they maximize
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.600]   for what the company wants, which is maximum engagement, maximum viewing time.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.080]   That has this impact.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:10.100]   And are there not societal and individual consequences to algorithms that drive you to
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:14.840]   spend all day watching more and more extreme videos in YouTube as an example?
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:20.680]   Yes, but there are also good uses of that kind of formula for relevance.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:21.680]   Well, that doesn't...
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.680]   Yes.
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:23.680]   That doesn't excuse you.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.680]   I'm doing research now.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:28.640]   And as I dig through, I'm buying book after book after book after book, because I see
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.760]   another footnote, I see another thing.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.560]   That kind of relevance is the basis of these structures.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.120]   And there's a sensible good basis for them.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120]   So what should you do?
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.680]   What should you do?
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.680]   I think they should be...
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680]   You're absolutely right.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.680]   We're agreeing here.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.200]   I think that they should be aware of number one, how it's manipulated, and number two,
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:52.200]   how it can be misused by users as well and figure out how to not go into a rabbit.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.200]   So you're saying...
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.200]   I agree with that.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.080]   Video makers are at fault for this.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.800]   No, obviously in that case, there's nothing harmful about saying you like vegetarian,
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:00.800]   maybe like vegan.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.600]   What's the harm?
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.600]   None.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   Yeah, but well, I mean, it could be.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   You could become an extremist.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   An extreme vegan.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.080]   But it also says...
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.080]   There are extreme vegans.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080]   I have an Austin.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.080]   I know.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:13.080]   I know.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.080]   Okay.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.080]   Gee.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   You ever want extreme veganism?
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.360]   The beer plant is a new pub in vegan place in Austin.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   It actually is really good.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   Oh, it would be.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.360]   Ooh, from San Francisco, right?
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.360]   Oh, did it?
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360]   Oh, that's your joke.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360]   Oh, I'm like, yeah, baby.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.800]   All the Californians are coming here anyway.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.440]   You saw the science study, which actually proved something that's obvious to anybody
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:44.360]   who's paying attention, that fake news has more legs than real news.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.720]   They'll be careful about putting...
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.880]   This was a very smart study, but it wasn't as...
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:56.000]   It was a very specific study from Deb Roy at MIT Media Lab, where they took a limited
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.200]   number of Twitter threads.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.200]   126,000.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:00.200]   Right.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.760]   And that was just not that many when you get right down to it.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:11.360]   But they looked then at people's habits of sharing things that had been specifically
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.040]   fact-checked false versus true.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.920]   And people equal to bots shared bad stuff more.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.960]   Well, bots did not.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.880]   You missed the fascinating, I thought, side line of this.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.960]   I thought when they took the bots out, it was the same.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.960]   No, yeah.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.760]   So when bot traffic was added back to the mixed computer program, spread false and true
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.760]   news about equally.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:33.760]   Oh, about equally.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.760]   Oh, I just read that sentence.
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.760]   Okay.
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:37.760]   Bots.
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:38.760]   Equally too.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:39.760]   Okay.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.000]   So the finding is humans rather than bots are primarily to blame for spreading fake news.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000]   Because...
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.920]   But who didn't know we love fake news?
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.920]   Yeah, we knew that.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.920]   But this is a verification.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.480]   The second shooter on the grassy know, I mean, we've always loved fake news.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.960]   We've always loved conspiracy theories.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.760]   But this proves it.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:03.480]   And what I think was important about this is you don't just blame bots or the internet
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:07.880]   research agency or Russians.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.880]   We take responsibility.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.880]   Blame humans.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:17.880]   I'm working with somebody, I hope I'm working with somebody who is going to try to do.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.200]   And campaigns and more about this is my phrase responsible sharing.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.760]   We all have responsibility when we share.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:29.040]   I do want to get that Netflix binge watching a badger.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   I watched all the seasons of Voltron.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.040]   Yes.
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.040]   Yes.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.040]   Which is actually a wonderful remake of the cartoon.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.040]   But...
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:45.280]   And I don't think Netflix or Google or Facebook does any of this because they're evil geniuses.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.280]   They do it because this is...
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.840]   This is what a business does.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.680]   It maximizes attention.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.080]   How sick did we get of four square badges?
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.080]   Right.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.080]   It works for a little while.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.080]   And then we say...
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.080]   I also have to say...
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.400]   Kids are very different.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.600]   Kids are super different.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.720]   They collect all kinds.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.360]   Have you seen the crap that they sell kids to collect?
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360]   One of the reasons...
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.360]   Sorry.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.360]   Go ahead.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.360]   Go ahead.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.360]   Garbage pill kids.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:16.080]   One of the reasons I don't like marketing and I don't market us very well is because I...
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:19.840]   I'm completely conscious of how we could try to manipulate our audience to get more viewing
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.280]   time and I try not to do that.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.560]   What would your best trick be?
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.800]   Oh, I mean I could do much more link-baity titles.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.200]   I could have more cleavage.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.200]   You could have more cleavage.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.200]   You know, you joke.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.960]   But back in the days of tech TV when we brought in a big time producer, the first thing he
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.000]   said is we need more cleavage on the screen.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000]   No.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   Yes.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]   Thanks.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000]   So let me rant momentarily about that.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.720]   So today I was watching Katie Tour who I think...
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:49.880]   I think a wonderful TV journalist and she was wearing a dress that was a little bit low-cut.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.640]   No big deal.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:56.840]   And so I was looking for a tweet of hers and I got creeped out by the men who were ugly
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:01.480]   in the dress and then I got depressed by the women who were scolding her for wearing
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.560]   the dress.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.240]   It doesn't matter what she wears.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.240]   Listen to what she says.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.240]   She's really smart.
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:07.240]   She's a good journalist.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.240]   But Jeff, you have...
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:12.280]   I have to say you have a particular kind of blindness to the fact that...
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   So I see what are you...
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.280]   What?
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.280]   You just noticed this, Jeff.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.280]   Okay.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:23.280]   You have a...
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.280]   But Jesus, it was...
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   But she got a full stop.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.280]   This is every woman's life.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.280]   I know.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.280]   And she gets it from both sides.
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.280]   It's just...
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.000]   And people were doing this in public.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.720]   It's one matter what they think it.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:35.320]   But they were doing it.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.320]   It's just...
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.560]   I fell for Katie Tour.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:38.560]   And every woman, yes.
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:46.480]   I'm sure she is, as our all TV hosts, bombarded with the message, not necessarily explicit,
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.920]   that the sexier you are, the better you will do.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]   No, I...
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.160]   No, I guarantee you.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.800]   I know I worked in television for many years.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.400]   It doesn't have to be explicit.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.400]   But it's very much in the water.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.280]   It is often times explicit.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.440]   And it can be explicit.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:07.040]   But it's there.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.040]   And it's a drumbeat.
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.040]   And it's...
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:17.200]   And it's particularly aggravating when men can look old and have gravitas and look
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.360]   lubby and disgusting and they're like, "Ree, I know."
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.600]   Yeah, there's no drumbeat for men to be sexier at all.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.000]   I mean, maybe for younger men, but I never felt any pressure to show more cleavage.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.040]   I just want to be clear on that.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.040]   Please don't.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.040]   Please don't.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:39.240]   I used to try, but they actually would discourage it.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:41.840]   So yeah.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.600]   And you can't...
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.000]   And so blaming the...
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.880]   You have to a little bit blame the platforms.
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:49.880]   You do.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.320]   Because they have to learn how they're used and deal with that.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.520]   They have to learn how they're misused and manipulated.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.520]   And yes, they have to study that.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:01.160]   And I think it's fair for a platform or a publisher.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:06.000]   I think it's... I mean, I'm not as successful as I would like to be.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.760]   We're successful enough.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:15.080]   And I choose not to do the things that I think are morally suspect, like encouraging...
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.360]   I always went around encouraging the...
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.000]   I would tell the young women who would join tech TV, be very careful.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.960]   Try to project a smart image, not a sexy image, because as soon as you go down that
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:30.160]   path, that way lies danger.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:38.960]   And even if it's not quite as successful, go for the smart person, not for the sexy person.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.680]   But it's probably, by the way, bad career advice in both television and Instagram.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.520]   Mm-hmm.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:47.520]   But...
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.520]   But...
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.960]   But had you ever told me to go to the sexy route, I would have punched you like actually.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.920]   Well, but I was sincere in saying...
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.480]   And by the way, a lot of these young women would in fact wear low-cut stuff because they
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:03.280]   knew whether consciously or unconsciously they knew that was not only what's expected
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:06.360]   of them, but that's what would work for their career.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:12.240]   But we also shouldn't judge them negatively for wearing what they want to wear.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.520]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.200]   I judge the platform.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.200]   Yes.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.200]   I judge the publisher.
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:18.200]   Okay.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.200]   Anyway.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.040]   Yeah, where do we get... how do we get here?
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.040]   Far-hod.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.520]   I'm a little bit miffed with far.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.240]   Is fake social media cleanse?
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.240]   And I like Far-hod.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.240]   He's been on our shows.
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.240]   He can drive me nuts at times.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.640]   I like him too, but he can also drive me nuts.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:36.800]   For two months, Far-head writes.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.280]   I got my news from print newspapers.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:43.320]   Here's what I learned in what has become now a style of article from the New York Times.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.040]   It is really grating on me.
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:51.640]   And then only a week later, the New York Times does it again with the most ignorant
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.040]   man in America, the man who turned off all the news.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:58.180]   It's the worst of the fake New York Times trend story.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:01.860]   Trend stories are another kind of cleavage, by the way.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.860]   Yes, they are.
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:04.180]   Yes, they are.
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:05.180]   So what's that is...
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:06.180]   Hey, not always.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:07.180]   Huh?
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:08.180]   Not always.
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:09.180]   No, not always.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.180]   More times off in the case.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:11.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.980]   I was like, I write a lot of trend stories about really geeky stuff.
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:14.980]   No, no, no.
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:15.980]   Because it allows me to go.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:16.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:17.980]   That's a different kind of trend story.
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.980]   Lifestyle trends.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:19.980]   That's a real trend story.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:20.980]   I love those stories.
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:22.480]   Otherwise, I never would have been too right about things.
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:24.240]   These are fake lifestyle trend stories.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.240]   That's a bit of a...
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.240]   Okay, yeah.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.240]   Got it.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.240]   Sorry.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.400]   And by the way, Farhad, during the entire two month period, he claimed not to be reading
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.100]   Twitter was tweeting.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:37.540]   Sometimes five, ten times a day, often retweeting news stories.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.540]   It was even more than that.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:39.540]   It was a huge number.
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:40.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:43.140]   Like 35 times a day in some cases.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:47.900]   So CJR called him on it and the times wouldn't do a correction and wouldn't apologize.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:48.900]   The Columbia Journal Review.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:50.900]   The Columbia Journal was reviewing.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.900]   Oh my God.
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:54.900]   Farhad.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:59.760]   He tweeted perhaps more than a thousand times in this period.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.520]   How could you say I got off Twitter and then tweet?
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.200]   Doesn't that seem like...
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   I don't know.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:13.160]   And it just struck me about the other story, the most ignorant man in America, is it was
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.920]   also the stance of privilege.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.360]   Well, I cannot worry about the world.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.920]   The fact that people are getting shot in the streets, well, doesn't affect me because
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920]   I'm okay.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:24.420]   I mean, I think there's a reasonable story.
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:30.220]   If what your reaction is, well, this was a bad way to deal with the election of President
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.220]   Trump.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.900]   That's what this point of this article was.
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.900]   He wasn't happy about the election.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:40.700]   So he's living a liberal fantasy by disconnecting.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:42.220]   But it's still a fake trend story.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:44.500]   It's one person, one anecdote of doing this.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:46.340]   One Nazi, one guy, whatever.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:57.660]   Uber has spent $10.7 billion in nine years to continue to lose money.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:59.660]   Well, Amazon.
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:01.660]   Eric, because of it.
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:03.220]   Yeah, Amazon isn't quite that bad.
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:05.100]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:07.260]   Amazon can make money if they want to.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.580]   Uber, I don't think could make money if they wanted to.
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:11.780]   Really.
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:13.020]   That's not their business model.
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:18.500]   Nobody would take Uber if they suddenly had to pay the actual cost of the ride.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:24.300]   They still have six billion cash on hand, but they've burned through quite a bit.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:28.260]   Are they biting time until safe, self-driving cars come and they're the platform we use?
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:29.260]   Is that the game?
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.340]   That's kind of the consensus seems to be they're looking.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.500]   They need enough runway.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.060]   But that's a lot of running.
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:39.660]   To get to some form of profitability, not based on what they're doing today.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:45.260]   Like delivering groceries or like delivering packages or like self-driving cars.
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:49.620]   If we could just get drivers out of the cars, we could be profitable.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.620]   That kind of thing.
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:53.180]   It's fascinating to me.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:54.180]   It's not the only company.
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:55.620]   It's snap like a snap.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:59:03.260]   There's a lot of companies out there burning through a lot of cash with no real Twitter
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:08.820]   had its first profitable quarter ever last quarter.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:09.820]   All right.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:13.580]   I think now we've covered all the...
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:15.780]   I think Stacey wants to run...
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.060]   Do we talk about Taco Bell?
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:19.060]   Do we talk about not just fries?
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.740]   And did we talk about not just fries?
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:22.100]   Do we get those both in?
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.100]   Okay.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.180]   We got the meat sweats and Taco Bell cheesy cancer.
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:31.700]   Stacey, for the sake of the show, we go try the not just fries?
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:32.700]   I will.
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:35.580]   I only want the Taco Bells.
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:36.580]   What's that?
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:37.580]   What's that?
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:39.980]   It's the soft tacos, the beef soft tacos.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.500]   Oh, and the nachos bell grinding.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.660]   But I stopped eating those because they stopped putting things that I liked on them.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.140]   They changed it.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.860]   I used to love the Enchorito back in the day.
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:54.300]   My favorite story about Petaloma is there's a Taco Bells very popular and right across
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:59.300]   the street, literally, right across the street is the best taco truck in town, maybe in all
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:02.060]   of Northern California.
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.740]   And it's crowded and I'm happy.
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:09.340]   And I love it that they just said, "No, we're going to park right here."
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.980]   We give you some good tacos.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:11.980]   I'll give you some good tacos.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:16.540]   Taco Bell was founded by a guy who didn't want to compete with the hamburger stand across
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.540]   the street.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:21.980]   The hamburger stand across the street, by the way, was the very first McDonald's.
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:26.180]   And so now you know the rest of the story.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:28.740]   I know that.
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:32.700]   My pick of the week is the Galaxy S9 in vivid purple.
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.860]   AKA, what do they call it?
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:35.860]   Lilac?
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:36.860]   Is it ultraviolet?
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:39.100]   The Pantone color of the year?
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:42.020]   Is that the Pantone color of the year is ultraviolet?
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:44.020]   You can't even see ultraviolet.
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:45.860]   Okay, it's purple, dude.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:47.020]   It's purple.
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:49.820]   That's why it's ultra.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.860]   Yeah, this is purple and it's pretty.
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.860]   They put, you know, it's funny.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:59.500]   They put the fingerprint reader in the right place, but I'm so conditioned to it being in
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:04.820]   the wrong place on all my previous Galaxy phones that I still, I rubbed the flash.
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:06.660]   They expect the thing to wake up.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:10.100]   It does have face recognition, they combine face and iris.
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:16.860]   It's not quite as fast as apples, but because it combines face and iris, it's considered
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:19.380]   to be pretty darn accurate.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:21.140]   Here I'll show you a see if you can see it.
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:26.140]   You'll see the red light come on at the top when I press the button and that's unlocked.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:27.140]   I don't know.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:28.140]   Could you see that?
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.140]   Here, do it this way.
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.140]   Let me do it this way.
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:31.140]   You can see it a little bit better.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:32.700]   So the phone is off.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:33.700]   Press the button.
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:34.860]   Red light comes on.
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:36.540]   I'm looking at it.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.540]   Red light comes on.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.540]   I'm looking at it.
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:39.540]   You know what I'm not looking at it.
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:40.540]   I'm looking at the TV.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.540]   What's your finger?
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:46.060]   At that point you go, okay, I'll use the finger.
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:48.100]   I haven't had it long enough to give you a full review.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:51.500]   Bixby cannot be turned off.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.820]   They've gamified Bixby as they did last time.
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.460]   I have 500 samples.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.460]   You know what?
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:57.460]   Dick dude.
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:58.460]   Bixby.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:01:59.460]   Bixby.
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:00.460]   Bixby is the worst.
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.460]   Look at it.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:05.540]   It thinks it's taking dictation and it didn't even come close.
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:10.140]   Look how slow it is.
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:11.620]   However, I do like this.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:15.740]   The phone as it comes out of the box has Google Assistant right in the front there.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.540]   Hey, okay, Google.
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.980]   That works fast and understands what I'm saying.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:30.260]   So it's another one of those things where Samsung's got two different of everything.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.980]   Samsung service and a Google service.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.580]   But I'm going to probably put a different launcher on it, disable the Samsung stuff.
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.580]   This is the unlocked one.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:43.700]   I have to say, at least they made the price competitive much lower than the iPhone.
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:46.220]   It starts at 720 for the S9 and the S9 plus.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:50.420]   The bigger one, that's what this is, is $840 unlocked from Samsung.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.540]   I think it's going to be a good phone.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:53.540]   I'll give you more.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:56.540]   It still has the silly side stuff, which I just can't.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:58.540]   What's the silly side stuff?
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:02:59.540]   The edge.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:00.540]   The edge thing.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:01.540]   Oh God.
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.540]   It's got a bezel.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.860]   I always turn that off.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:06.740]   Yeah, you slide in from the edge and you get this.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:07.740]   Oh, okay.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:11.180]   I was like, whoa.
[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:14.780]   And then unfortunately, when you slide in from the other end, you get Bixby.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:16.260]   Oh, not Google.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.740]   Not something useful.
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:19.540]   No, but just put it there.
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:20.540]   You just put a different launcher.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.540]   This is great about Android.
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:22.540]   You don't like it.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:24.540]   Put a different launcher on, which I will.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:26.700]   You get all rid of all the cross that way.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:27.700]   You have a launcher.
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:28.700]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:33.400]   The thing that you don't get rid of is Samsung's slightly different implementation of the
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400]   settings.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.560]   I actually like it.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.900]   And Samsung does add a lot of, I think, useful features.
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:43.220]   It's like the sound check, which you do a hearing test and it adapts the sound for your
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:45.260]   headphones to match your hearing.
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:47.900]   Things like that are nice additions, I think, to Android.
[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:52.380]   So I'm not, I don't dislike what Samsung does with Android.
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:56.660]   And if you put it, if you put it, your favorite launcher, I put action launcher on.
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:59.980]   You know, is there a regular Android launcher?
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:00.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:02.820]   There's, you can put Google's own pixel launcher.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.820]   You can put it at Google.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:04.820]   You can.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:05.820]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:06.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:07.820]   That's why we like Android.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:13.020]   See, Apple doesn't really use interface that you Apple prisoners you.
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:15.220]   I use both.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:19.540]   But, all right.
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:21.300]   Stacy, you got a thing this week?
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.300]   I do.
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:23.300]   You guys are good.
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:24.300]   I love it.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.100]   Okay, let me, let me put the link in because I forgot.
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:28.100]   I'm looking for the link.
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:32.660]   I was trying to get the most up to date price, but so far that's not happening.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:37.580]   But you're going to love it because it is a smart ironing system that a friend went
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:38.580]   to the.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:39.580]   Thank God.
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:42.300]   You finally got an IoT device appropriate for your gender.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.940]   Oh, I'm going to smack you.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:46.940]   Where is my?
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:47.940]   Where is?
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:54.220]   In our family, I don't iron Andrew irons because he's actually patient and good at it.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.220]   And I am not.
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.700]   You know who irons in our family?
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:58.700]   Nobody.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:04:59.700]   Laundry.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.020]   We send it out.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:06.820]   I'm like, well, is this flipper the ironing board that saves 80% of your time?
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:07.820]   Not that one.
[02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:08.820]   Laura.
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:09.820]   No, that's a kickstarter.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:10.820]   That's pretty cool.
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:11.820]   Laura star.
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:12.820]   Laura star.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:17.500]   It's not the minke super size smart fit ironing board reflector.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:18.500]   It is not.
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:22.820]   So it is not the Oslo smart iron.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   I mean, so the.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.820]   Oh, no, the ole so.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:25.820]   Oh, Lisa.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:26.820]   Oh, Lisa.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:27.820]   Oh, Lisa.
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.940]   Oh, I actually seen this.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:29.940]   This one's silly.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:30.940]   Okay.
[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:35.420]   It doesn't do anything cool, but this one is really smart.
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:37.220]   It's the Laura star.
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:41.540]   Apparently there's a big market for a smart ironing boards that you search for that and
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:43.020]   you get a lot of stuff.
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:44.020]   So what is this?
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.940]   Smart ironing board or a smart iron?
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:47.460]   It's smart iron.
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:51.020]   So it has a sensor in it in it tracks your motion.
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:56.780]   So you have to when you pair it to your phone, it will teach you how to iron better by tracking
[02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:58.820]   how you're moving your stuff over your clothes.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:05.540]   It also senses your clothes and it says, Hey, this is itself adjust to whatever it's
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:06.540]   ironing.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:07.540]   Wait a minute.
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:08.540]   Teaches you had an iron better?
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:09.540]   Oh, geez.
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:13.140]   Does it have an oh, shut up button?
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.140]   No.
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:17.300]   Oh, how hard is it to iron?
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:18.300]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.500]   Some people have a heart to I.
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:23.140]   So I will say like I had a pleated skirt.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:25.180]   That thing was a bear to iron man.
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:26.180]   Yes, of course.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:27.820]   Nobody irons pleats.
[02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:29.820]   You also have the wrong equipment.
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.180]   You need a plate iron.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:33.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:37.860]   Well, so but people try and a lot of times like when I have dresses or stuff and Anthony
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:42.020]   Nielsen are one of our great producers who says he needs this.
[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:44.020]   He does not know that iron.
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.020]   See, okay.
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:46.660]   You're going to show it Leo.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:48.660]   No, he's wearing.
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:53.780]   Actually, it may be he's wearing Steve Jobs black jeans and a black turtleneck.
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:54.780]   Come here.
[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:55.780]   People don't believe me.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.580]   You look just like Steve Jobs.
[02:06:57.580 --> 02:07:03.260]   So Laura Star is a Swiss company and they are super expensive.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.260]   Oh, boy.
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:07.180]   And they also have into go with this iron.
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:12.060]   You can actually buy a company ironing board that it has like it's like an air hockey table
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.780]   that poofs up your clothes so they don't crease while you're ironing.
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:15.780]   I like that.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:18.180]   Oh, I'm going to do this.
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:20.180]   Uh, about $1,400.
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:22.180]   Oh my God.
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.180]   Cheese.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:26.180]   And she just put the clothes in your expensive oven.
[02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:28.540]   The Laura Star go.
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:31.980]   It's $2,500 ironing board.
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.940]   Yes, that that is a different one.
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:34.940]   That is who.
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:38.220]   Again, these are these are fancy irons.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:40.780]   People who can afford this don't do this.
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:44.900]   I put a towel on my counter and iron on that.
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:46.220]   That's crazy.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:48.140]   I'm just I'm just.
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:53.380]   I'm telling you, I am bringing you the fancy connected home goods.
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.980]   You didn't know that you wanted.
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:00.500]   Well, I do use when we don't iron, but we do use a steamer if we have to get wrinkles
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:05.900]   out and I do I am fond of steamers and they also have Laura Star makes a very expensive
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:06.900]   steamers.
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.900]   Steam.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:08.900]   Sorry.
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:09.900]   Did I call it a steamer?
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:10.900]   It's a steam generator.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:12.540]   Oh, they're they're fancy.
[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:15.020]   A new way of ironing.
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.140]   I thought this was kind of cool.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:21.020]   So you don't have to, but did you are you getting it?
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:23.260]   No, come on iron.
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:24.260]   Oh, that's right.
[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:25.780]   There'd be no point.
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:29.420]   I if it's not what Andrew wanted.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:30.860]   He wants a steamer actually.
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:31.860]   Seamers are right.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:35.740]   He's asking for steamer for our ready our 16th wedding anniversary.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.780]   He is the perfect husband.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:44.620]   I will send you I did some research on steamers and I bought a steamer and I will send you.
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:48.980]   I can't remember where I might have been consumer reports, but the best best team is
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:50.980]   like $58 by the way.
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:51.980]   Excellent.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:52.980]   Send it my way.
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:53.980]   $9,800.
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:59.700]   And it's good, but it's but you got to be careful because it will spit.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:01.860]   You don't want to spit because then you get wet.
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:05.220]   You might dryer has a steamer setting, but I've never used it.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:10.380]   No, no, no, what you do is you hang the clothes on a nice hanger that has the shape you want
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:15.020]   and you don't put the steamer on the clothing, you just go up and down near it and it's
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:16.020]   beautiful.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:19.620]   It's just the wrinkles go, whoo, bye, goodbye, goodbye.
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:25.260]   You know where I learned about steamers is the wardrobe people at television.
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:26.740]   They all use steams.
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:27.740]   That's what they use.
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:29.740]   They don't iron stuff.
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:31.260]   Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number?
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.260]   Yes, I do indeed.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.980]   As soon as I oops, sorry, there were to go.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:42.260]   Google says it removed more than 3.2 billion bad ads in 2017.
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:43.260]   Wow.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:47.860]   That's like double in it had and it's a double nearly deliverable point seven billion in
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:49.220]   the year before.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:51.580]   That's a hundred bad ads per second.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:53.500]   So I just want for a week to hear.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.420]   Wait a minute, per second, per second.
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.340]   So we're talking about scale.
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:09:59.340]   This is a problem of scale.
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:05.900]   So when Al Franken, who I like, but when he went after Facebook saying, Robles, but
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:08.460]   the edge, Robles, you should have seen that.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:12.260]   That imagine this bar will be the scrivener, taken in the ad order and every other thing
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:13.260]   that we have ever had.
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:15.500]   So, Robles, I better look at this.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:16.500]   They don't know.
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.700]   A hundred bad ads, bad ads per second.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.180]   Wow.
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.420]   The scale of this is amazing.
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:31.620]   79 million ads for sending users to malware-laden sites, 400,000 malware sites, 66 million trick-to-click
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:38.140]   ads, and 48 million ads that promoted the prompted rather unwanted software installation.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:41.820]   So thank you, Google.
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:43.700]   Very interesting.
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:49.540]   Friends, we've come to the end of this strange meandering.
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:55.980]   We call this week in Google, this festival of oddities and weird facts.
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:56.980]   I don't know about you.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:58.540]   I like it that way.
[02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:01.820]   Oh, I know what I should have picked for my thing.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.300]   What?
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:05.340]   The new Raspberry Pi with our internet.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:06.340]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:07.340]   Isn't this nice?
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:08.340]   That's amazing.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:09.340]   Yes.
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:10.340]   It is really impressive.
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:13.420]   Raspberry Pi 3B, I think it is.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:14.420]   Yes.
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.420]   Yes.
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:16.420]   Model B plus.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.220]   3B plus.
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:20.700]   Just in time for Pi Day, still $35.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:22.460]   I'm unbelievable.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.900]   But dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi?
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:25.900]   Wow.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:29.780]   It's got a 1.4 gigahertz quad core.
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.340]   Quad core 64-bit.
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:32.340]   Bit 64-bit.
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.340]   Wow.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:37.340]   And it's got power over ethernet for your smart home projects.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:38.340]   If you're excited.
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:41.500]   DOE is really a nice thing.
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:42.500]   It is.
[02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:43.500]   It's very fancy.
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.500]   Now you don't have to have a power cord.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.340]   Just have an ethernet cord that powers it.
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:49.060]   I know it's kind of meaningless.
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:52.820]   But if you tried to buy a computer with the power of that Raspberry Pi 10 years ago,
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:53.820]   what were we called?
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:55.700]   That's a good question.
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:56.700]   That's a really good question.
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:57.700]   Well, I will follow up.
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:58.700]   10 years ago?
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:11:59.700]   Well, pick a date.
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:00.700]   Pick a date.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:03.700]   We'll be on a certain point you couldn't have gotten it.
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.700]   Right.
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:05.700]   Yeah.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:06.700]   I will do that.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:10.700]   I will do that math and come up with it for you next week.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:14.500]   Well, this particular Broadcom processor is an ARM processor.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:16.260]   And so there wasn't even a 64-bit.
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:18.420]   Yeah, it's kind of hard to...
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:19.420]   Cable.
[02:12:19.420 --> 02:12:20.420]   Yeah.
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:21.860]   So I'm getting a new laptop before next week.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.860]   I'll probably have it.
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:28.460]   Windows laptop that runs on a Snapdragon 835, it runs on an ARM processor, running full
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.660]   Windows 10.
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:38.620]   And this is kind of an interesting transition point where this is an 845 in this 9 Plus.
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:43.420]   These are desktop class processors at this point.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:47.420]   And so that now becomes very, very interesting.
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:48.420]   I think.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:51.180]   So I won't compare it to an ARM chip from 10 years ago.
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:54.580]   I'll compare it to an Intel chip from 10 years ago, probably through benchmarks.
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:55.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:58.100]   Quadcore 1.4 gigahertz processor.
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:12:59.100]   You can't even do that.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:00.100]   You're going to...
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:02.540]   I'm going to have to do like Geekbench and see what the geek...
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:07.460]   If somebody will run a Geekbench on the Raspberry Pi Model B Plus and then we can see what
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:12.780]   the Geekbench of 10 years ago to get a comparable Geekbench, I guarantee you it's thousands,
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:13.780]   Jeff.
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:14.780]   Absolutely.
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:15.780]   I guarantee you.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:16.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:17.780]   It's a lot of money and it would have run hot.
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:18.780]   And it would have run hot.
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:19.780]   You'd have to have liquid cooling.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:20.780]   Very loud fans.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:21.780]   Yeah.
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:24.100]   It is really cool.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:25.100]   It's just...
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.460]   Who started Raspberry Pi?
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:28.460]   It was...
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.460]   Oh, oh.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.460]   Evan.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:31.460]   Evan Upton.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:32.460]   Evan Upton.
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:37.300]   Who is a delightful person who I have interviewed on separate occasions and every time I walk
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:41.420]   away just like, "Oh, you're what humanity should be."
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:43.220]   We've had a great graduation.
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:44.220]   He's a young guy.
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:45.620]   He's 39.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:52.020]   He wanted to duplicate something that many English kids have grown up with.
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:53.020]   Yep.
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:56.940]   The BBC computer, the Acorn, the Cclair.
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.780]   These cheap...
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:05.900]   Clive Sinclair came up with like a $70 cheap computer and he realized what a difference
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:06.980]   that it made in his life.
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:08.820]   And so he created this.
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:15.340]   For schools, he was Director of Studies and Computer Science at St. John's.
[02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:16.340]   And he made a...
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:17.340]   He made a...
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.340]   He's well in money from this.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.340]   I don't think so.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:20.340]   No, but he made a career.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.340]   He made a career.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:22.340]   He made a career.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.340]   Yeah, it's a foundation.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:27.900]   It's a foundation and now they have like certified teachers and that sort of thing.
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:30.260]   And he's...
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:31.780]   I feel like...
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:33.780]   No, I won't say...
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:34.780]   I don't know.
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:35.780]   I don't feel like anything.
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:36.780]   He's a pretty guy.
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:42.860]   He always bring him Raspberry Pi's and he's actually not fond of them because Raspberry
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:47.260]   Pi is not as delicious as other kinds of Pi's.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.260]   He's like...
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.260]   It is a sweetberry Pi would be better.
[02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:50.260]   Oh, very fun.
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:52.540]   Yeah, he talks about it getting all gummy and kind of the seeds and stuff.
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:53.780]   And I'm like, I'm with you, man.
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.780]   No, Raspberry should not be made into Pi.
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:56.780]   It's like my grandma.
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:57.780]   So if you...
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.700]   I had her carrot cake once when I was five years old and said it was good for the rest
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:01.700]   of her life.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:03.340]   I had to eat the damn carrot cake.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:06.260]   By the way, Lance, that happens in my house all the time.
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:11.020]   Broadcom makes the chip in it, but he is now a technical director at Broadcom.
[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:16.060]   And of course, the other tech news, which we didn't report on, that President Trump
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:18.980]   earlier this week nixed the deal.
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:23.900]   Broadcom was trying to buy Qualcomm and he said, for national security reasons, I'm going
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:25.660]   to block that period.
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:26.660]   End of story.
[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:27.660]   What do we think of that?
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:28.660]   It's over.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:29.660]   I don't know what to think of it.
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:30.660]   I don't either.
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:32.300]   I didn't see much analysis of it.
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:38.580]   So it was a little... before Trump came in, is it Siphias?
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.260]   The committee on...
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.740]   You know who I'm talking about.
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:42.900]   Guys, right?
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:43.900]   Don't.
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:46.660]   It's the committee on foreign investment.
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:48.580]   They've scuttled other deals.
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:50.540]   I'm going to find out who it is.
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:51.860]   Committee on foreign investment.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:52.860]   Yes.
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:53.860]   So CFIUS?
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:56.100]   I don't know.
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:57.100]   It's CFIUS.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:00.620]   Oh, yeah, because it's got US.
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:01.620]   So Siphias, yeah.
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:02.620]   CFIUS, yeah.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:03.620]   It's a treasury department.
[02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:04.620]   Whatever it is.
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:05.820]   It's a treasury department.
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.980]   Well, yes.
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:10.100]   And they look at these types of deals.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:15.140]   They actually, when... was it Huawei wanted to buy 3com?
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:16.260]   They nixed that.
[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:17.540]   So this is what they do.
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:21.660]   So they were actually looking at this and they said, "Hey, we have a lot of strategic
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:22.940]   technology.
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:24.820]   Do we want this to go to Broadcom?"
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:29.100]   Which after it's no longer domiciled in the US.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:34.460]   What is interesting to me is Trump actually before the deal was announced met with Hawk
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:38.540]   Tan, the CEO of Broadcom back in October of last year.
[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:41.460]   To celebrate the fact they were coming back to the US.
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:46.020]   Yes, to celebrate the jobs and the Broadcom is doing more here.
[02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:52.580]   So I thought this was like, it felt very much like Trump doesn't... he's not aware of it.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.540]   And then someone puts it across of his desk and they're like, "This is bad."
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.540]   And he's like, "Oh, okay.
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:58.100]   Yeah, I can see how this is bad.
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:16:59.100]   Check."
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:04.020]   He could make a credible case one way or the other for why he blocked it, to be honest.
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.460]   But I'm not sure it's a bad idea.
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:07.460]   Broadcom is repatriating.
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:09.540]   They're coming back to the United States.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:11.900]   But right now they're headquartered in Singapore.
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:14.740]   Squallcom certainly has many patents.
[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:18.820]   It has all the CDMA patents and many LTE patents.
[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:19.820]   And so that...
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:22.300]   There might be a legitimate national security concern.
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:25.020]   I'm not against the idea, frankly.
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:28.020]   Squallcom is really two companies.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:31.820]   The company that makes money is the patent holding company and the company that makes
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:35.140]   chips does all right, but it's not nearly the profit center that patents are.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:36.140]   They don't make chips.
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:37.140]   They design chips.
[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:38.140]   They design chips.
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:39.140]   They...
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:40.140]   Sorry.
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:41.140]   Systems on a chip.
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:42.980]   No, no, that's a completely apt correction.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:45.100]   Oh, guys.
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.100]   We talked about food too much.
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:47.100]   Go have barbecue.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:48.100]   Because now it's starving.
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:49.100]   Go have barbecue.
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:51.580]   If I lived in Austin, I'd be on my way.
[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:55.340]   There is a place out a little bit farther that we always go when we go to Austin.
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:56.340]   We didn't go this time.
[02:17:56.340 --> 02:18:00.660]   That has the best Mexican food and it has wonderful tequila.
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.860]   It's on that avenue that going out of town.
[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:04.500]   I can't remember the name of it, but it's really...
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.500]   I think I know which one to read.
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:06.500]   Go there now.
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:09.380]   The avenue going out of town.
[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:10.900]   We have many avenues.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:11.900]   Congress.
[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:12.900]   There's...
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:13.900]   There's Brazos.
[02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:14.900]   There's San Jacinto.
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:15.900]   I can't remember.
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:17.900]   Oh, is it Warros?
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:18.900]   Yes.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:19.900]   Warros.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:20.900]   Isn't it good?
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:22.900]   It's all right.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:25.940]   What's your favorite?
[02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:32.020]   My favorite Mexican food in Austin is probably el chile.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.020]   Because I like their mole.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:35.500]   Oh, we were talking mole.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:38.020]   We were talking mole.
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:42.260]   There's a restaurant called Las Palomas that's actually weirdly enough in a strip mall in
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:44.980]   Westlake and that is freaking delicious.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:45.980]   You're more sophisticated.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:48.420]   But we did have a tradition of going.
[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:49.420]   It's on South Congress.
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:54.140]   We used to have a tradition of going out to Gueros every time we went to Austin.
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:56.380]   Only a 7.7.
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:57.380]   So...
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.380]   It's not...
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:00.020]   I mean, just Mexican food.
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:01.020]   I'll eat any of it.
[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:02.020]   It's a tourist.
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:03.020]   It's a tourist destination.
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:04.020]   I'm a tourist.
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:05.020]   No, no, no.
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:06.100]   We used to eat there.
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.100]   It's not a tourist.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:09.380]   I mean, now because South Congress is kind of crazy.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:10.380]   It is.
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:11.380]   But...
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:12.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.620]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:14.620]   Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:16.420]   Find her at StacyOnIOT.com.
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:18.740]   You really must subscribe to her newsletter.
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:24.380]   And once again, Stacy, my deepest thanks for hooking us up with Wendy Nather and Beau Woods
[02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:25.380]   and that great panel.
[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:26.780]   We've been showing it over and over again.
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:27.900]   We did South by last Friday.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.300]   It was fantastic.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:31.300]   Thank you for your help with that.
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:32.300]   Yes.
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:33.300]   Thank you.
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:34.300]   It was super fun.
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:35.300]   Yeah, super fun.
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.340]   In fact, I think we're going to do more of that.
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:38.740]   So stay tuned.
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:39.740]   We really enjoyed it.
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:42.260]   I thought it went so smoothly.
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:43.260]   We thought we could do this.
[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:44.260]   We could do this more.
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:45.260]   And other events.
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.980]   We should do this more.
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:47.980]   Get out and see the road.
[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:49.460]   Come to New York.
[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:52.700]   Yeah, well exactly.
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:54.180]   That's where Jeff Jarvis hangs his hat.
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:20:01.020]   He's a professor of journalism at the Tau Night School of Journalism at the City University
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:02.020]   of New York.
[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:06.580]   We're some very lucky graduate students get to work with the best.
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:09.380]   He also blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:11.940]   And has written many in book, including Geeksering.
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:13.660]   On privilege to be here.
[02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:14.660]   Most of every week.
[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:16.100]   It is our privilege, Jeff.
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:17.980]   Thank you, both of you for being here.
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:20.140]   And we'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:20.660]   Bye bye.
[02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:30.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
