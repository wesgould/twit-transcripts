[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.160]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   This week in Google, Episode 41 from May 6, 2010,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.720]   Blinking 12.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   This week in Google to show the covers, the Google
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.240]   Verse and all the cloud as well, joining us
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.520]   our regular panel of Google Wizards,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.200]   starting with the author of What Would Google Do.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.920]   He's a professor of journalism at CUNY
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160]   in a well-known man about town.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.240]   Mr. Manhattan, we call him.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.760]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.280]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.080]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.280]   Jeff's blog, BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.040]   And I'm in my office in CUNY, and I have behind my shoulders
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.680]   my Museum of Dead Technology.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.040]   Over there is the Moro Pivot.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.080]   There is my Osborne 1.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.040]   Wow.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.320]   People are going to think you're old fashioned.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.240]   And then what is that extra?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840]   You've got a framed newspaper or a broad--
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.240]   That is the store's quake.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.360]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.520]   Was that the call bulletin that you've got there?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.000]   The Oakland Tribune.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.920]   Tribune.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.480]   Very nice.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   Gina Smith.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.760]   Gina Smith.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.600]   Gina Trepani.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.960]   My old friend Gina Smith saying, I'm on the show.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080]   Gina Trepani is here.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.120]   She is the blogger at smarterware.com,
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   kind of the proto-blogger, the creator of Life Hacker
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640]   and the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.560]   waveguide.com.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.800]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.200]   Hello.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.560]   Happy single day, Mio.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.680]   Made their baby by five.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.800]   I read them state your point.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.320]   Pah-hah burritos today.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   It was not a good day to go.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.560]   John, can you get me a margarita?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.040]   A margarita.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960]   Picture margaritas all around.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   You're virtual.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.280]   Oh, I'll have to drink it all, I guess.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.640]   I was going to bring my corona wet line,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.160]   but it's a little early for me.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.520]   You know, after all the trouble that Colleen went to
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   to build Skype-asaurus, this four-way Skype thing,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   Skype has announced that they're going to do multiple videos
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   in one client now.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.520]   They're going to have five-way video calling starting next week.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.160]   Well, it's about time.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.640]   That's great.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.120]   It's all because of you, Leo.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.040]   I think they must have listened.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.960]   I'm getting rid of eBay.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.920]   I think I've got a lot to do.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.840]   Yeah, maybe eBay was the problem.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.120]   Of course, iChat's done this for some time,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.080]   and there's other products like Ooh, that do it.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.920]   But you know what we-- you know what it might do for us?
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.000]   It might mean that we can then have five people
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.080]   in each of the four windows.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080]   Oh, sweet.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   And you'll never get a word that's mine.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.440]   Never get a word that's mine.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960]   It was, really.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.920]   It'll be the gang.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.280]   Yeah, Gilmour would like this.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.920]   It's an actual gang.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   Gangstahs.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.880]   So let's take a look at the top stories for Google this week.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.440]   So much is all starting to run together.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.560]   Did we talk about HP buying Palm last week?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.520]   Yeah, it actually happened.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.720]   It happened during the show.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.520]   It was a record show.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   OK, that's right, because Paul Theron had that story.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.760]   So I'm going to put a flag in the sand there.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   And then everything since then, we could talk about it.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   I thought this was actually an interesting story.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.320]   And Dana has highlighted this, that Facebook had a little privacy
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.920]   leak.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.440]   You--
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   Shocking.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.160]   Sorry.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   I love their spin on it.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.120]   You know, I mean, it's practically saying it's a feature,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.640]   not a bug.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.280]   The chat--
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.800]   Good.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.680]   This way.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.880]   Yeah, we meant for you to be able to see everybody who's
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.600]   asked to follow you.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.560]   Facebook's security bug allows users to access and view
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   friends, live chats, friend requests, and friends in common.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.800]   And this is kind of the scary thing about all of this new stuff
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.960]   on Facebook is it seems to me that there's so much stuff
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.320]   on there now that they need to double down on their protecting
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.960]   our privacy.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.880]   And all of these laps is just really terrifying me.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.160]   After we talked about it at the last show,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.000]   I wrote a post thinking of just because as usual,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.400]   the show inspires me.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.000]   And thinking that they got it kind of just exactly reversed,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.280]   that what they should do is become our protector of our
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.800]   identities online and make that a business model.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.760]   There you go.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.240]   That's it.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.640]   It may have lost too much trust already to do that.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   But who better to do this than Facebook?
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.760]   I think they should start their equivalent of the--
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.960]   what's the Google thing that allowed?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   You can assure that things got exported.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.760]   The free--
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.960]   Data liberation from that's right.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.480]   Right.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   Facebook should have an equivalent spokesman for our
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.560]   needs within the culture because clearly it ain't happening.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   And if they did, I think there's a business opportunity there.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.600]   You know, the former Facebook security and privacy guys is
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.440]   now running for Attorney General in California.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.120]   And on his page, he says, yeah, Facebook really ought to get
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   it together.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.720]   I mean, to Facebook's credit--
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.280]   Mark, here's a bus.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.720]   We're going to throw you right under that there.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   To Facebook's credit about this exploit, it happened when you
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.160]   use that feature where you can view your profile as one of
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.880]   your friends sees it, which is actually a pretty useful
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   feature, right?
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.880]   So if you have the crazy ex's friend or whatever, you can
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.280]   say, hey, what can he or she see?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.720]   So that is a cool feature.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.760]   And that's the feature actually where the exploit happened.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.480]   You could temporarily see chat messages and friend requests
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.120]   of someone else's--
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's kind of-- I guess you're right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.160]   That's kind of minor.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.320]   But what about Jeff's point?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.720]   That maybe this is an opportunity missed on Facebook's
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.440]   part.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.400]   That we'd be much more likely to store stuff there if they'd
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.920]   say, hey, we are the safe, secure repository of your stuff.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.640]   Yeah, I mean, trust is really Facebook's biggest problem.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.400]   I trust Google.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.720]   That's why I'm doing this show.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.600]   Even though they scare me a little, they've earned my trust.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.680]   Facebook hasn't earned my trust.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.440]   They just freaked me out, period, which is--
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.960]   Was that always the case or was there a moment when they did
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   something that violated that trust or went too far?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.400]   I was never really a big Facebook user until recently.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.200]   But everyone that I know who was, because I'm involved with
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.280]   a lot of people who are involved in academia and students
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   and administrators who use Facebook as just part of the
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   job, which is just so embedded into that culture and that
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.400]   community, right?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.560]   There's always been this feeling of mistrust of people that I
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.480]   know who use Facebook.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.000]   My other half calls it fascist book.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.400]   I think it's just kind of this accepted--
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.000]   Why do you think that is?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.400]   Because they change their privacy settings so often.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.880]   So that great idea that's documented, right?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.120]   Because they pop up dialogues that say, do you want to
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.080]   keep things the way they were, or do you want to go this way,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.880]   or do you want to import all your likes?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.600]   They change things a lot.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.760]   The options are confusing.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.280]   And I think that people have situations where they see
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.880]   stuff on Facebook that they realize that they're not
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.080]   supposed to or weren't meant to.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.520]   And that's just because privacy settings had changed or
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.120]   they weren't configured correctly.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.000]   And I really like Jeff's post about, I think that Facebook
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.840]   really needs to turn things around in terms of trust.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.280]   Because I think people are closing their accounts.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.920]   In fact, I'd love to see numbers on that.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.520]   I don't know if there are.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.400]   It does seem to be a trend.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.480]   I would say it at.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.640]   I deactivate in my account.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.240]   And then I brought--
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.280]   It's just volumes.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.200]   It does.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   It does.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.440]   Leo is a trendsetter, for sure.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.720]   Well, I brought it back.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.240]   Oh.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.320]   And the reason I brought it back was not because I miss
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.840]   my friends or because I need Facebook personally, but
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.360]   because professionally, I don't--
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.560]   don't we have to have a presence on Facebook?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   That's why I state.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.120]   Someone yelled at you inside the company?
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.120]   Dane said, what the hell you doing?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   No.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   No, but Dane did say, did you deactivate the TWIT page, which
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.120]   was tied to my Facebook account?
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.480]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.120]   So you administer pages, right?
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.760]   Like public pages.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.600]   I do the same.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120]   If I could have a public page without my personal account,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.640]   I would absolutely do that.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.160]   Right.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   Right.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.560]   You know, I was in a session about online identity
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.760]   with Christmasina this weekend, this past weekend,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.080]   at Fu East, which is the Arilis Get Together in Cambridge.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.120]   And we had this kind of conversation that's like, OK,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.880]   everyone in the room is like--
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   doesn't-- isn't comfortable with the idea
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.760]   that Facebook is becoming the person in charge
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.320]   of your identity.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.840]   So the question was, like, who should be?
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.320]   And one of the better answers was Google.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   But you know, like--
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.360]   It's not good either.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.160]   I don't think Google's a good choice either.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.800]   Well, there's a startup here.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.760]   There already exists.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.960]   It already exists.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.720]   And this is-- I'm sure what Christmasina said,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.560]   because he was the OAuth advocate,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.320]   is that if you support Open ID--
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.360]   Open ID, yeah.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   You can have your page or any page you delegate
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.360]   be the keeper of the keys and use Open ID to point to it.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.640]   And I think that that's a system that exists now.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.720]   I have an Open ID page on my twit.tv.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.880]   That's my-- twit.tv is my Open ID page.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   It's-- if you use--
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.960]   If you're watching it, there's an opportunity
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.120]   to create a startup on top of that using that--
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960]   Well, there is.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.040]   Yes, I agree.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.960]   We're at for you, because the problem is Open ID.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.560]   Yeah, it's got to be easier.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.760]   You know, it doesn't do anything.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   You need to make this ready for prime time.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   And you need to be able to show your presence
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.720]   across the whole web.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.920]   There are quite a few of such things.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.200]   There's claim ID, which is I've used for a long time.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.600]   I used to. I used it once, and I haven't kicked it up.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.200]   The part of the problem is you've got to keep it up.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   This is the thing.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.880]   Then this was the point that they brought up in the session
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.960]   is like there has to be a compelling reason, right,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.880]   to use a system for your identity.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.520]   And Facebook has a very compelling reason,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.280]   which is that all your friends and connections
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.640]   and information are there.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.880]   And you see that Facebook connect button everywhere.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.760]   And you know, and even Chris said that Open ID is just
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.000]   like a little too geeky for--
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.720]   people had a hard time with the idea
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.400]   that URL represented you versus like an email address,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.440]   because we're used to an email address representing you.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.480]   But that's why companies like Jan Rain and Open ID started
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.240]   is, well, we'll make it easy.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.120]   We'll help you do that.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.640]   Well, I heard from Rick Clow at Google,
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.440]   ex-blogger now.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.560]   He is the product manager for Google Profile.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.520]   And it's been interesting.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.840]   He's been talking about this listening to everything
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.640]   and thinking about it.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.560]   And he's brand new to it.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.960]   We should maybe have him on and challenge him and say, well,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.520]   if Google were to try to go to this area,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.200]   how should they do it?
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.480]   And under what principles?
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.920]   And he's listening to people about it right now.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.400]   Rick would be a great guest for sure.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.560]   Rick would be a really good guy.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.920]   Remind me, we'll get Dan to get him and Bookham
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.320]   in as quickly as we can.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.680]   I mean, I use Google Profile.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.400]   I kind of thought that might be the definitive page.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.320]   But that's where Genius Point is exactly right.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.680]   Problem is, I don't know that anybody looks at my Google Profile.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.240]   Right.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.000]   So there isn't that necessity in feedback to doing it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.520]   Well, wait a minute, though, if it could,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.240]   if Google would do the right thing with it,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.720]   which is make it be the first result on a search for my name,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.480]   then it works and everybody sees it.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:01.920]   That's right.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.560]   That's their power.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.760]   They use their power for God.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.080]   Make it be-- and I thought that's what the intent was.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.240]   I thought so too.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.200]   They didn't quite fully commit to it, right?
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.800]   I can't tell if it's because they're waiting for more people
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.840]   to fill them in.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.560]   Because it shows up-- or Leo, it doesn't show up for you
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.000]   at the bottom of the page.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.280]   Doesn't show up at all for me.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.760]   Because I'm a celebrity, apparently.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.880]   You're a celebrity, yeah.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.640]   But it does show up for common names or regular names
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   of my names at the bottom of the search results page.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.360]   But who scrolls down?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.120]   No, it should be that.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.680]   Number one.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.080]   It's--
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.160]   You're exactly right, Leo.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.920]   And that's why I leaped on it.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.080]   I thought, finally, I can control my Google search result.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.200]   This is the number one result.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.520]   This is what Leo says is the canonical information.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.080]   Well, you also offer that then.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.480]   If Google went into that right, you
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.640]   offer the same thing to every brand out there.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.000]   Right.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.520]   Maybe that's why they don't do it.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.080]   Maybe that's why they don't do it.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.120]   Well, but what would be wrong with that?
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.600]   As long as if it's a real brand and a real person,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.240]   there's not a spam problem there.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.000]   Because it's-- who's going to go search for Russian Viagra?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.720]   Right.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.480]   I got to get the Russian Viagra site.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.280]   Well, maybe.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.480]   Well, maybe it's fine.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.080]   If you do, fine.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   That's where we're going to go.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.880]   The problem is-- but Wikipedia solved this.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.920]   The problem is ambiguous.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.880]   But Wikipedia has a disambiguation page.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.840]   If there's 14 Jeff Jarvis, they list all 14 and say,
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   this one, this one, this one, this one, or this one.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   And you click the one you want.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.480]   Google would have to do something like that as well.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.720]   I don't know what I'm going to myself lately if I--
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.160]   I think there's only one Jeff Jarvis.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.400]   I was just being optimistic.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.040]   The talented Jeff Jarvis is a jazz musician.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.880]   The fun Jeff Jarvis runs Segway Tourism Thailand.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.240]   The smart Jeff Jarvis is a professor
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.440]   with a doctorate in Australia of tourism.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.800]   Wow.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.440]   I'm just the blathering Jeff.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   Well, you know, there's a Google employee named Jason
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.260]   Chen.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.960]   God help him.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.640]   It's a news.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.040]   But if you search for Jason Chen,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.400]   like you'll see Jason, the Gizmodo editor, and Jason,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.920]   the Google employee, and at the bottom of the--
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.520]   So they do offer some sort of disambiguation.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   Yeah, there is some.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.320]   And it will say the name, their location, and their title.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.200]   So you can say, oh, that's Jason from Fremont,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.040]   who works for Gizmo's.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.960]   No, it's weird.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.680]   There's four profiles for Jeffree Jarvis
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.240]   at the bottom of the Jeff Jarvis search.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.440]   Three of them are mine.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.080]   How the hell I ended up with more than one, I have no idea.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.800]   Really?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.640]   Are for email addresses?
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.880]   Huh.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.800]   That's strange.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.440]   I don't actually see it at all.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.560]   Maybe it's Jeff.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.600]   Just Jeff Jarvis?
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Jeffree?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.520]   Just some marine.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.400]   That's the masculine Jeff Jarvis.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   United States Marine Corps, Coney Graduate School
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.480]   of Journalism, Coney Journalism Professor.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.280]   I don't know.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.640]   I think you just hit on it.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.520]   I think you hit on the secret to identity.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.360]   You need the font-- you and Gina together.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.520]   Gina says you need some reason to do it with positive feedback.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.480]   You gave Google the positive feedback.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:47.960]   Right.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.840]   They've got to use their power for good there.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   And that's how they fight against Facebook.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   Yeah, because I would trust--
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.840]   I mean, Google profiles, I was willing to trust.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.000]   I put everything in there.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.360]   I go buy some more Google stock right now.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.840]   And it's a different kind of trust, by the way,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.000]   because on Facebook, you put things like,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.480]   what's your relationship status?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.200]   And there's this whole social graph of who you know, who they
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.920]   know, that's what was leaked out, right?
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.440]   And--
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.920]   That's what you really go to.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.120]   You guys see the EFF page where they looked at Facebook's--
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.920]   The timeline.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.400]   --roading privacy policy timeline.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.840]   If you read the privacy policy in 2005, it is this, quote,
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.560]   "No personal information that you submit to the Facebook
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.040]   will be available to any user of the website who does not
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.640]   belong to at least one of the groups specified by you
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.520]   in your privacy settings period."
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.360]   That's how it should be.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.480]   That's good.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.080]   And now, 2006, we give you control.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.640]   But the default privacy settings are considerably broader,
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.520]   even a year later.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.160]   Limit the information displayed in your profile
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.960]   to your school, your specified local area,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.080]   and other reasonable community limitations
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.760]   that we tell you about, but not here.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.360]   Then it goes, your name, school name, profile picture,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.120]   thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.200]   network unless you alter your privacy settings.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.720]   That's 2007.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.960]   2000-- by the way, it's also getting longer and longer.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   There's more to reveal.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.240]   And glazed eyes.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.000]   See, this is the difference between Facebook and Google,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.500]   right?
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.840]   Is that Facebook started with private information
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.800]   and got more public.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.040]   Google started dealing with public information
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.240]   and then started offering services
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.480]   that dealt private information, like Gmail and stuff.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.880]   Here's-- get ready for this.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.240]   Here's the current policy.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   When you connect with an application or website,
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   it will have access to general information about you.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.800]   The term--
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.520]   Well, there's just soothing radio voices.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   The term--
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   That's it.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.520]   Don't worry.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   The term general information includes your and your friends,
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.320]   names, profile pictures, gender, user IDs, connections,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   and any content shared using the Everyone Privacy setting.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.880]   The default privacy setting for certain types of information
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.040]   you post on Facebook is set to Everyone.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.520]   Because it takes two to connect your privacy settings,
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.400]   only control who can see the connection on your profile page.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.960]   If you're uncomfortable with the connection
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   being publicly available, you should consider
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.800]   removing or not making the connection.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.920]   In other words, you want to protect yourself on Facebook?
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.440]   Don't use it.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.840]   Except that's where we're headed here.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.920]   They're going to kill their own golden goose
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.880]   because they want us to connect more.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.320]   If we stop connecting them with all these fears,
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.520]   then the value of Facebook declines.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.640]   Ooh, now he's brawling.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.160]   I might deactivate again.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.200]   I was talking to a friend who has teenage sons who
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.560]   was saying that her kids have figured out that you can change
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.080]   your name on Facebook and that they
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.920]   kind of play games with the relationship stuff,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.040]   like saying that they're married to their teacher
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.120]   or to their--
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.840]   No, see.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.360]   --or they list a sibling who's a friend.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.720]   And my nephews, I noticed, do similar things.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.000]   They set silly names and they say they live in different crazy
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.880]   places and are related to other people who they're absolutely
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.520]   not related to.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.000]   So that's kind of fun to think about how the younger generation
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.600]   is a--
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   They get it.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.960]   --disrupting Facebook stuff.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.720]   They get it, right?
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.440]   They get it.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.720]   And they're turning the data bad.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.520]   Right.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.840]   Well, in fact, there's an article.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.760]   There's something that a college kid--
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.200]   seniors-- college bound seniors are doing
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.560]   is changing their Facebook name to some handle
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.920]   so that the college can't search for their name
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.640]   and see their Facebook information.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.400]   My daughter told me that they were doing that.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.880]   And that's very widespread.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   And the thing is, these kids are--
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.840]   this information spreads immediately to all the kids.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.000]   So they know how to handle this.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.360]   It's people like, frankly, it's old farts like us
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.920]   that are getting bit because we have
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.080]   certain different expectations.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:51.400]   I think it's what's her name was saying at South by Southwest.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.000]   A Data Boy.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.360]   Data Boy?
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.240]   We are a generation that has a different expectation
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.560]   than their generation about--
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.360]   Right.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.960]   There was also-- there was a video out
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.400]   by the American Library Association this week
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.680]   for lockdown, privacy month, and Corey Doctor, who
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.400]   respect immensely, is on there.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.240]   But I also think that there's this fear thing about privacy.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.800]   Oh, everything's going to be locked out.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.200]   Everything's going to be locked out.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.680]   And my next book now is going to be
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.880]   about the benefits of publicness.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.080]   And I think we risk giving up all these connections
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.320]   we can now make.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.720]   That's the beauty of the web.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.440]   Well, I agree.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.960]   And we have to learn from our children
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.120]   about those connections.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.520]   We have to teach them the risks and dangers, yes.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.040]   But I think there's a lot to be learned there.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.800]   But they're figuring it out, and they're saying, oh, OK.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.840]   We just give phony names, phony connections.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.720]   We are in control.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.040]   That's the key to it.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.760]   And Facebook forgets that at its peril.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   There's an older bit of goody.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.960]   Maybe this is too old for-- but I just put on the chat to you, Leo.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.920]   A 2008 video about the human Facebook.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.760]   Yes.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.240]   You said you remember seeing that one at the time?
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.560]   Should I play it?
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:52.920]   I don't know.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.800]   It's the oldest two years old.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   We'll put it up on the--
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.760]   It was-- it really is wonderful.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.680]   Basically, Facebook-- you know, I don't know.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.240]   It might even still be apropos.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.680]   So just play a little bit of the audio.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   Just play 30 seconds.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.920]   Because you'll get the idea pretty quickly.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.360]   They're hammering at the door.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.920]   Hello?
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.040]   POK!
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.860]   Edward Baxter, it's maybe Tom from Skoll.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.320]   Oh, we sat next to each other in maths.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   We didn't get on, remember?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.240]   Do you want to be my friend?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.080]   What?
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.360]   Do you want to be my friend, confirm, or ignore?
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.760]   Great.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.120]   Where did we meet?
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.920]   You know where we met.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.040]   Do you want to skip this step?
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.120]   We met at Skoll.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.520]   Look at that.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.120]   How about we say, we met on an oil rig,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.400]   and we were lovers for 50 years.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.480]   That's not true.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.720]   It's a joke.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.360]   It's like a really brilliant joke.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.680]   Can I get confirmation on that, please?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.120]   No.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   Can I get confirmation on that, please?
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.600]   No.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:54.920]   OK.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.600]   Are you in a relationship?
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.080]   I've got to.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.800]   Is it complicated?
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   It's complicated.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.320]   Friendship, dating, whatever you can get.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.280]   Let's just say random play, because that could mean anything,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.400]   like really, really kinky, horrible.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.080]   What are you doing?
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.640]   Right on your wall.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.520]   I've written.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.560]   I love it.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.120]   It's really--
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.680]   That's great.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.080]   It hasn't changed that much.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.680]   But what that was was the people who first
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.360]   came to Facebook's kind of shock at the whole thing.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.800]   What's sad is that now so many people have used Facebook
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.600]   for so long were inured to that side of it.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.840]   And so we just kind of accept it all.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.760]   And I think that that's really the great risk
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.000]   is that we've just kind of gone, oh, OK, that's the way it is.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Well, I want to go back to your brilliant idea.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.800]   The two of you can claim a patent for this together, I think.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.720]   But the problem is that the more our identity
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.120]   becomes Facebook's property, the more we feel free to lie about it.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.160]   The more the canonical me is my property, the more truthful
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.240]   I'm going to be about it, because it's me and affects me.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.040]   You wouldn't lie on your Google profile, my bother.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.640]   Right.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.400]   Right.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.440]   Well, then the problem becomes, well, yes, I lie,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.960]   but I lie to pump myself up.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.880]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.160]   That's my resume.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.960]   Another matter entirely.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.600]   But some--
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.400]   I think we have to own our own identities.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.600]   And when we do that, we'll maintain the highest value
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.560]   possible order.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.360]   Great.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.320]   All right, so a great subject.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:27.920]   And I'm glad that--
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.120]   You solved the problem, you guys.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   Glad we fixed it.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.200]   So is it Christmas, you didn't say anything else?
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.840]   I mean, he works at Google now, we should mention.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.760]   What is his title there?
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.480]   He's kind of in charge of--
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.600]   He's like social--
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.760]   --social stuff.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.960]   Open person.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.840]   Open social guru person.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.320]   He'd actually be good to have the show too, sometime.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.960]   Yeah, but we didn't really come up with conclusions.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.600]   It was more just like trying to figure out
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.000]   how do we get to this place with Facebook at one point.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You know, Tontic
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.920]   It used to be Friendster, and then it was Orca.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   Then it was MySpace.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.040]   Back in the day, we never thought anyone would overtake MySpace.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120]   Now it's Facebook, and that most likely it'll be--
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.600]   It's a huge opportunity.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.400]   --some other small startup that will upend Facebook
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.160]   at some point.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.320]   I would invest in that.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.960]   I mean, I damn near start a venture fund for identity
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.520]   right now.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.000]   I think there's a huge opportunity--
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.680]   That's interesting.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.840]   Facebook is weak.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.040]   Where would the opportunity be?
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.640]   I think it starts with services that help you maintain
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.880]   your own identity, to give you control over it.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.120]   This is the reality where we are right now,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.960]   is our identities are what you find online about us.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.360]   And so how can I manage that?
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.040]   So it's an SEO--
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.960]   Yes, that's huge.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.440]   Try to get it.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.040]   It's an SEO for me.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.120]   That's huge, though.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.640]   SEO for me.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.680]   And that's our concern as geeks with resumes, right?
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.360]   I mean, as media personalities you want to be found.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.120]   But for people who use Facebook, for most people,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.440]   the value is the social thing.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.560]   And the identity thing is just kind of this byproduct.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.520]   Like, how many people--
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.360]   I don't know.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.400]   I mean, what's the market?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.320]   Like, how many people are concerned about the right time?
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.280]   It will be a big market as soon as it becomes widespread
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.880]   that people--
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.080]   I hear for people all the time.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.840]   And somebody's writing something about me on a web page.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.360]   I think people more and more are going
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.000]   to want to control what is known about.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.400]   What is canonical information and what is not.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.880]   Right.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   In a sense, Google tried to attack it, but reversed.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.960]   It was like, I think, Facebook got the bizarre or wrong version
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.120]   of what they did.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.440]   The Open Connect wasn't open.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.480]   Same here, Sidewicky tried to say, well, you can go to that site
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.520]   now and you can leave a comment there, whether they like it or not.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.240]   Saying this or that.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.080]   Well, that's not the point.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.240]   I don't want to necessarily control my distributed identity
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.160]   because I can't--
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.920]   I want to give you one that is mine that is official.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.240]   But that's what claim ID--
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.360]   I mean, truth is, that's what claim ID--
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.760]   So why isn't it more widely used?
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.240]   Because what used-- that's where
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.520]   Leo, you added the secret sauce to it,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.560]   is because no one uses it.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.800]   No one goes there.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.600]   I have to maintain it.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   How would you know it's there?
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.400]   It's like a scale.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.560]   Whereas if I knew that the first thing you're
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.320]   going to see on a search for me is this thing,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.120]   I'm going to maintain it.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.960]   So only Google can do this then.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.760]   Only Google can do it.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.720]   I mean, Facebook could do it too because that's
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.640]   why I maintain my page.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.600]   It's what Gina said.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.240]   That's what put these two together in something very big.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.560]   So that's what maybe we need to just kind of keep
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.040]   telling Facebook.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.480]   You know, what's interesting is, I think,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.640]   for the vast majority of people, Facebook is their web page.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.280]   Yes.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.520]   And so that's what's really happening here,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.640]   is that as if geo-cities came to you and said, OK,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.520]   make your own web page.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   And now, anything that you've put on that web page,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.000]   we're going to sell.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.200]   And we're going to manipulate.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.880]   And we're going to make public in ways that you didn't know,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.440]   unless you explicitly tell us not to.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.040]   Or it's like LinkedIn, you know, predecessor to Facebook,
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.320]   comes along and says, oh, well, now we're
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.880]   going to reveal to the whole world all the contacts you have
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.800]   and everything else about your career and everything else
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.080]   that you only intended for people you
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.960]   had connections with to see.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.840]   Exactly.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.640]   So it's not just selling.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   It's just-- it's the same mistake
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.920]   that Google made with Buzz.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.640]   It mixed the public and private.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.280]   What occurred to me this week, too,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   was that in Facebook, I can make my own public.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.760]   I can decide who to connect with.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.640]   In Twitter, public-- I can decide what public side belong
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.720]   to whom to follow.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.960]   The fatal flaw in Buzz was, OK, here's a ready-made public
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.240]   for you.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.840]   We know your public.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.720]   Here it is.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.640]   And in a sense, Facebook's doing the same thing now
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.760]   by saying, well, we're going to make you public in these ways
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.040]   that-- and you can go fix it if you want.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.600]   And it doesn't give me sufficient control.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.120]   It gives you-- you have to jump in and fix it after the fact.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.360]   It's just somebody's said in a brilliant headline--
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.080]   and I think I said this in the last week's show--
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.960]   that privacy settings are the new setting in your BCR.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   Yes.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.760]   That is a good one.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.200]   Nobody knows how to do it.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.960]   I say that to young people, and they say, well, what's a BCR?
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   We're all blinking 12 now.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.240]   We're all blinking 12.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.560]   You know, maybe that's what I mean.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.520]   It's a blinking 12 in-- you know, graphic on my Facebook page.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.680]   I can't figure this out.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.200]   All right.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.920]   So your second-- one more thing, Leo.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.480]   So your backup to destroying or disabling your Facebook
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.520]   identity is to erase everything on it and denude it.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.720]   Well, that's what I'm going to do.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.840]   I'm going to eliminate the personal page entirely.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.920]   Oh, that sucks.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.600]   And then I'm going to take--
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.440]   I have two pages.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.720]   I have Leo G. Leport, which is friends and family.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.200]   I'm going to just kill that.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.960]   And then I have L. G. Leport, which
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.760]   is the tie to the Twit page and the Leo Leport
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.520]   public fan page and all that.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.080]   I have to keep that alive, otherwise the Twit page
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.920]   and the fan--
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.840]   But really, all I want is fan pages, right?
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.280]   This is really all I want.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.780]   Right.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.280]   That would settle.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.600]   Which is a new one, connection with people.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.720]   That's what the internet is about,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.680]   is making connections with people.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.040]   That's what Facebook enabled.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.600]   That was its entire value.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.400]   And they're giving up that.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.080]   They are.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.640]   They're changed.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.400]   They changed their business model, basically.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.520]   It's really-- I don't think they realize what they're doing.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.160]   I think they do.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.000]   It's interesting, when they did the first steps
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   in this direction about a year ago,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.960]   we actually streamed the press conference live.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.360]   Scoble had a laptop that was holding it up.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.960]   And then I asked Dave Moran.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.080]   And I can't remember who else from Facebook.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.880]   I said, you didn't go far.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.560]   You kind of took a half step towards making this public facing.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   But you didn't go all the way, which makes it less useful.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.440]   Why didn't you?
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.400]   And he said, well, we have this contract with our users.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.520]   And I said, well, you have a choice
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.320]   you're between being classmates.com or being Twitter.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.880]   And it looks like you're heading towards Twitter,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.680]   but you're kind of scared of going on the way.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.920]   And he said, yes, we are.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.600]   Obviously, they lost that fear.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.760]   And they realized that this is where they wanted to be.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   They didn't define evil.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.400]   Right.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:58.600]   Right.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.480]   Google defines evil.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.040]   If Google loses our trust, they lose the whole game.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.080]   That's what the equation really is.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.960]   And enabling their employees to stop them from doing that
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   in their own protection is what don't be evil as all
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.280]   the rap about.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.960]   And that meant that you had a common and shared definition
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.600]   of evil inside Google.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.440]   Developing, sure, but pretty common.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.360]   People could add to it if they got critical mass.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.960]   It strikes me that Facebook didn't define evil.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.040]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.560]   It's a good point.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.280]   Well, if they don't define it, it will be defined for them,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.680]   I guess.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:31.960]   Keep going.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.040]   We're going to change this to the name of the show to Twiff.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.320]   This week at Facebook, it's all the cloud, baby.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.960]   All right, well, let's talk about Google.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.600]   Google has given once again--
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   I guess they're always tweaking their search results,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.280]   a little facelift to the search results.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.960]   What's changed, Jeff?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.320]   I couldn't tell you that was the beginning of the first.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.720]   Because the problem is I don't get it on the actual page.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.440]   I see it on the official Google blog.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:54.960]   Not there.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   That's the issue for me.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.240]   Yeah, I think they're kind of rolling it out.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.160]   They seem to be tweaking that options panel on the left side,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.200]   which I have to say.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.680]   I really kind of-- I wonder how many searchers actually
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.360]   click that show options.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.560]   But what's interesting is that instead of just being
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.600]   a list of links, there are now little icons.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.280]   There's a little color there, which is--
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.800]   News blogs, images, books, more.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.600]   I think this is a little bingish.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.000]   It is a little bingish.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.280]   Is it an option anymore?
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.880]   Is it just show up there?
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.600]   In the screen image that they have up there, screen grab,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.280]   I don't see any clothes--
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   There's no clothes.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.920]   It's now no longer an option.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.040]   They also said, we'll know the difference between, let's say,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.320]   Gossip Girl and Times Square Bomb.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.080]   If you do, Gossip Girl will show things
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.320]   that seem to be appropriate for a television show.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.160]   And since if you search for Times Square Bomb,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.760]   you're going to see things that'll be appropriate.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.360]   It seems like the same things.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   So we've got-- sorry, Gina, go ahead.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   No, no, I was going to say, you're right.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.280]   They must be just be rolling it out, because in one computer,
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.000]   I'm not getting it.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.080]   And I'm getting it.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.440]   And the one I am getting it on, there's
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.920]   no hide show options anymore.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.680]   It just shows up.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.560]   So you get it now, this is it.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.520]   So strategically, I think this is where Google has to go
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.120]   in a few ways.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.720]   One, it's going to go more and more and more
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.760]   to personalize a targeted, more relevant search, right?
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.240]   And which is going to start to kill the dark art of SEO,
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.320]   I think.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.280]   And they want more signals from us
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.480]   so that they can be more relevant to us.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.260]   And I think it also goes to what Matt
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.360]   cuts that on the show some weeks ago,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.320]   when we talked about demand media and how Google has
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.160]   to find two things.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.760]   One is the signal for more original content.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.360]   And the other is the signal for more quality content.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.480]   And I think that they've got to fight back against SEO
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.600]   in a strategic way to say that the whole idea of gaming
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.000]   and us the same for everybody isn't going to work anymore.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.720]   The more signals they have of what we want and relevance,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.280]   the less SEO is going to work and the less those tricks
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.160]   are going to work, I think.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.760]   But I read too much into Google all the time.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.120]   That's what I do for it.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.440]   You give them so much credit.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.640]   Well, it looks like what they've done here is--
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.600]   I thought buzz would work.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.440]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.480]   I still keep using buzz.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.040]   I love buzz.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   I want buzz to work.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.880]   Silly us.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.240]   Silly, silly fools.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   So what they've done is you still
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   have more search tools, which exposes the real time stuff
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.080]   and a lot of the drill down stuff.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.320]   So you do have a drop down.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.880]   But what they've now said is always
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   you'll see these four extra categories-- everything, news,
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.040]   videos, and updates, these filters.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.800]   You want those on the top now?
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   I was thinking it was move those, actually, if I go to--
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.680]   Well, and they're still on the top.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   Look, you're right.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.160]   Yeah, they are.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.120]   That's interesting.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.720]   It's interesting.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.560]   It's quite a bit of UI for Google.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.920]   Maybe Marissa Meyer took the week off.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.000]   Yeah, it feels like a lot of UI for what
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.360]   used to be text box in a button.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   But maybe this is just them kind of tweaking and rising to--
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.960]   It's really what you don't want to do
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.000]   is have this same thing as on the top duplicated
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.440]   down the side.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.200]   But you know them, they're going to AB test the hell out of it.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.600]   Yeah, they definitely are.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.080]   And there's something very eye catchy about those icons.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.840]   Well, we've learned this.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.640]   I think Twitter taught us this.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.160]   Images are very important.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.200]   Images are everything now.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.120]   You've got to have a picture just
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.600]   to have the human-bound works.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.400]   I suspect they'll get rid of the stuff on the top.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.280]   But it's weird, too, that they-- so on the top.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.480]   So you see what matters to them.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   Images?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.780]   They don't miss shopping, books, blogs, updates,
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.320]   discussion.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.600]   Those are all under the extra.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.840]   They're hidden.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.200]   Now, if I just searched for McDonald's,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.560]   I've been looking for Times Square, Bobber.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.240]   You know what?
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.440]   You get a little bit different.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.920]   You have updates.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.280]   It changes the changes of the message.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.480]   So it's an adaptive menu.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.840]   And this is a new link, updates.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.840]   I don't know what that means.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.120]   I guess-- oh, this is the real-time stuff.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.440]   This is the tweets.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.640]   Let's tweets.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.160]   OK, that's interesting.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.840]   Now, it's not just tweets, by the way.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.760]   Here's Friend Feed.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   For Zoom Buzz.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.120]   There better be in there.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   Still looking for Buzz.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.640]   It's not yet.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   I don't see-- right here.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   Look at-- I don't see Buzz in there.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.140]   No Buzz.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.280]   Twitter, Facebook, and Friend Feed, but no Buzz.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.080]   Jesus.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.600]   Wow.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.160]   We have the committee meeting, folks.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.360]   You know, this is what happens at Microsoft, by the way,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.240]   is you get these fiefdoms fighting with one another.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.040]   And I wonder if that's what's happening,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.120]   if that's what's happening.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120]   It can't be.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.680]   I do like it that it's real time that they're
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.480]   scrolling real time.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.800]   I know there's a lot of us talking about the Times Square
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   Bobber.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   They're just testing.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.920]   And it's not there.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.280]   Yeah, a lot of Twitter.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.160]   There is Facebook.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.000]   There is Friend Feed.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.440]   I mean, why would you include Friend Feed and not include Buzz?
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.520]   Maybe Buzz doesn't-- you know, it may be a lack in the API.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.000]   I mean, you think they have that internally.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.160]   Yeah, API is--
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.880]   That's what's holding Buzz back.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.800]   Yeah, they're still developing it, for sure.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.600]   Got to work on that API, guys.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   At least get us a third party.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   You're on the safe.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.200]   Yeah, for your own sake.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.400]   They may not have a fire hose, you know?
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.400]   Which is obviously what this is working with.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   It's funny that--
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.000]   How do you-- I didn't know you could get this-- you'd get
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.200]   a fire hose at Facebook out.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   Well, that's what-- one of the things that was changed recently,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.040]   you know, you could get the fire hose,
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.400]   but you'd have to delete the cache results after 24 hours.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.120]   So it was kind of a limited utility.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.720]   Who wants to get a fire hose that you have to keep track
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.920]   of how old the data is and throw it out after 24 hours?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.400]   They changed that last week or two weeks ago,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.520]   and now you can keep it forever.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.000]   So I would not surprise that Google didn't include it
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.040]   until that time, because now it's in their search.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.640]   It's indexed like everything else.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   But you've got to wonder.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.240]   I mean, if they're putting-- let me find one of those
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.120]   Facebook results and see.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.760]   It's taken me back to a link from motherjones.com.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.400]   I wonder that the Facebook link is not hot.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.600]   I guess I'll have to click the actual link.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.760]   Does that take me to Facebook?
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.200]   It does.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   And it takes me to Facebook fan page.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:54.600]   And by the way, I'm not signed in.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.760]   Yeah, I can't see any Facebook updates.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   Did I like it?
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.160]   Damn.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.680]   No, I try to stay unsigned into Facebook.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.880]   It's not easy, believe me.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.320]   There's a Facebook.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.360]   Interesting.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.520]   Now, Gossip Girl, there's updates,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.880]   but it's under the extra thing.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.960]   You have to unfold it.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.760]   There's a Facebook.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.400]   And that takes me to some person's site named Gossip Girl.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   But it's not the Gossip Girl.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.800]   It's a Gossip Girl.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.080]   That's confusing.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.920]   The Facebook's Open Graph API makes this indexing public pages,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.400]   especially public posts much easier.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.200]   So what is a public post?
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.640]   Is it anybody who has said my wall is available to everybody?
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.840]   Yes, but I think mostly you're going to see pages.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.200]   Like fan pages are public, right?
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   Right.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.400]   So that's what we're seeing now.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.160]   So the posts and the comments there are all indexable.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.800]   And like you said, ever since that date,
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.440]   they announced that applications have no limit on how long
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.160]   they can cache data.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.240]   Well, let me just see.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:14.640]   On my Facebook page, say, what the hell is Gossip Girl?
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.400]   Now, would that automatically--
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.840]   I mean, what is PageRank doing with that?
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.400]   How does it know whether it include that in its Gossip Girl
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.760]   results?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.880]   I mean, do we even know what it's doing?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.520]   I mean, it's not obviously everything about Gossip Girl.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.480]   I mean, let me go.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.200]   Maybe I made it.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.680]   Let's see.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.200]   It can't be because there must be millions
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.440]   of tweets every minute about Gossip Girl.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.240]   Yeah, probably.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.760]   So there's some some some foo going on
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.720]   that we don't know about.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.320]   There's-- Twitter just has such a me.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.440]   A friend of mine invested in a company called Amplicate.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.960]   And they put up pages that just suss out
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.000]   whether a company sucks or rocks and puts that up.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.440]   And I was talking to them a bunch today.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.400]   And the data that you can get out of that,
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.080]   you can just start to realize who likes more stuff, who he--
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.920]   Liking is a huge.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.960]   Well, that's what--
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.760]   That's what Kevin Rose--
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   But that gets to figure that.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.560]   There's the interesting thing about the Facebook like thing.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.520]   Ricky taught us my friend, and he said that Ricky said
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.000]   that every-- the volume of dislikes
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.360]   is so much greater than likes.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:22.840]   Right.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.400]   Sucks is much greater than rocks.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.800]   Right.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.160]   Yet what did Facebook enable?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.880]   Likes.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.080]   No sucks.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.320]   No, no, no sucking in our--
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.760]   Well, maybe they did that on purpose.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.280]   I mean, doesn't that skew the results if people are just
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.880]   going, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.560]   You know, advertisers.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.080]   Oh.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.000]   Right, advertisers.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.320]   Well, but wait.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.880]   You know, I thought Dig did a brilliant thing,
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   which was it lets you go thumbs up with thumbs down
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   on the ads.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.080]   That's not what Facebook is going to do.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.680]   I agree with that one.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.280]   But that was brilliant.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.960]   And Fin Dig says it's working for us
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.720]   because the advertisers love to know this.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.600]   They don't show ads to people who don't like the ads.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   They don't want to annoy them.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.120]   I agree.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.840]   But every ads salesperson I know would--
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.040]   it's like your throat.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.240]   The story came in.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.880]   What happened was USA, the insurance company--
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.840]   and I'm a customer of theirs and pissed at them right now--
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.480]   they came in and they sent a cease-and-assist letter
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   to Amplicate saying, take down this negative page about USA.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.680]   You even mentioned them as a use of their trademark
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.480]   in Blood, Mobile One.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   Right, stupid.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.080]   The great thing about this was, if they
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.040]   had to take down the negative page,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.000]   they had to take down the positive page.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.320]   And the positive page had like 10 times the number of posts
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.200]   that the negative page did.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:25.720]   Stupid.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.200]   Oh, man.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.600]   Those old lawyers ruined in the world didn't realize
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.960]   that this notion that you can control your brand
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.640]   and all that and all that.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.600]   And I know ads has people I deal with would just scream
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.800]   about what they did.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.520]   They're right, but they're screaming anyway.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.400]   Google has said it's going to go into e-book sales
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.800]   this later this year.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.760]   I wanted you guys to comment on this story
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.200]   because I'd like to know what this means.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.400]   It doesn't seem to me that they're going--
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.560]   although all the press said, oh, they're
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.640]   going after Apple and Kindle.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.760]   But they're not going to have.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.680]   They can't possibly be getting random house best sellers
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.480]   on here.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.040]   This is going to be their Google Book Search stuff, right?
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.680]   This is going to be the public domain stuff.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.600]   I don't know that.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.240]   Oracle and I read it.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.560]   I'm actually trying to find it.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.680]   It said that it sounded like they
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.400]   would be striking deals with different publishers
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.320]   to sell even--
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   According to the Wall Street--
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.680]   I don't think that this is just the--
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.000]   This is also the mechanism to sell the old outer print books.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.640]   That's what I thought it was.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.480]   That's what I thought it was.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.800]   The journal says publishers have yet to publicly commit
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.840]   to participate in the service.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.200]   But Google isn't expected to run into much trouble
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.720]   getting them to join.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.960]   Because they hate Amazon.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.640]   But wait a minute.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.120]   I thought there was no copy protection in this.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.200]   Is there DRM?
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.760]   Yes, there is.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.560]   You can't--
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.360]   Google said that they would--
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.760]   if I come into Google Search, Google Book Search,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.320]   and I find this mention of Greek history
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.120]   that you listen to in lectures, Leo,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.600]   I want to look more of that book,
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.920]   it will stop me before a certain number of pages.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   Now Google will have the opportunity to sell me the book.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.840]   And that was part of the--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.600]   settlement was what share they would then give,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.920]   publisher would share, Google would take.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   OK.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.160]   Why don't they just use the Amazon affiliates program?
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.480]   Because this lets them fight up against Amazon,
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.080]   because the publishers hate Amazon.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.120]   I was at my editor's office this week,
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.600]   and boy, you mentioned Amazon in there,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   and they just--
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.400]   I can't say anything with the book.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.320]   Really?
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.120]   Really?
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.800]   Interesting.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.160]   Why?
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.840]   Because the Amazon sets the price.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.160]   It's the apple of print.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.080]   Not anymore.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.640]   Right.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.320]   I mean, the cool thing about Google Additions, right,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.240]   is that they're saying that it's platform agnostic, right?
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.400]   So they're going to-- you're maybe
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.240]   going to read the books in a browser, whatever read that you have.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.480]   That's why there can't be copy protection.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.240]   Well, well, not--
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.080]   How would you do that?
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.920]   Because the Kindle uses one thing.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.360]   Apple uses another thing.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.280]   A browser does-- can they do cross-platform DRM?
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.600]   I don't think so.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.280]   Does it say anything about DRM in here?
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.040]   Because I'll tell you what, I know for a fact,
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.680]   no publisher is going to do it without DRM.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.800]   Absolutely right.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.120]   Right.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.640]   Well, I mean, the DRM could be, I
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.240]   need to be signed into my Google account
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   in order to read the books that I purchased.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.200]   It's like HBO Everywhere.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.480]   Well, how would I do that on a Kindle?
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.000]   Right.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.800]   Well, that's--
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.480]   Well, maybe that's the one you don't do in the "ANIA" Amazon.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   Well, but no, the only device I could do that on is a web browser.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.640]   It wouldn't work on an iPad.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.800]   It wouldn't work on a Kindle, and it wouldn't work.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.600]   It might work on an iPad.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.160]   Yeah, they said that the company could also build--
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.680]   this is all just speculation.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.480]   Google could also build software to optimize reading
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.840]   on certain devices, like an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.040]   It hasn't announced any specific plans.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.440]   So I mean, it's just kind of an interesting--
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.920]   it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.880]   I wonder if this is going to-- if anything's
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.720]   going to be announced about this at I/O, along with the TV
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.400]   announcement that's supposed to come as well.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   But it's interesting that just the different approaches,
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   right?
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.640]   Like Amazon launches this e-reader, and then every single book,
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.000]   you know, e-book that they sell, you can only get on the Kindle.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.640]   And Google's taking the open approach.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.760]   What's your sense, then?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.120]   Would publisher-- I mean, are we--
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.480]   we're in a post- DRM world, and music.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.520]   Is our books next?
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.760]   Will publishers be willing to sell books without DRM,
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.320]   because they hate Amazon so much?
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.240]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.200]   No, no.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:14.960]   Good question.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.160]   That's a big log, too, to leap over.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.080]   So I mean, I just think there's technical issues
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.000]   to doing DRM if they're going to do that cross-platform.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.840]   It's EPUB.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   They're going to use EPUB.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.560]   EPUB can support DRM, but it's done differently,
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.720]   I think, on all these devices.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.480]   I don't know.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.240]   Maybe I'm full of it.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   I'm curious, though.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.200]   Well, I mean, if it's a technical problem that needs to be solved,
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.880]   I think Google probably will be in the solving.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   I mean, maybe we're talking about a browser plug-in.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.240]   That's kind of annoying, because--
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.640]   you know--
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.160]   Right.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.880]   I don't know how--
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.560]   --the best world is to just nap.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.200]   Twitter has launched a--
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.080]   Is this going to be your tip?
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.400]   Gee, not want to steal your tip.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.680]   Twitter has launched.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   It's Android app.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.800]   They did not license C's mick or any other app,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.400]   Twitteroid.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.880]   They did their own thing.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.600]   Well, they did.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.720]   Well, are they bought?
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.400]   Well, we don't know.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.080]   It doesn't say.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.920]   And it's not clear.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.000]   It's nothing I've ever seen before.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.040]   And I thought I'd used every Android client for Twitter.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.400]   It's got a nice little floating cloud thing going over there.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.760]   It does have floating clouds.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.600]   The floating clouds annoyed me, so I turned them off.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   Oh, you can turn them off?
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.240]   You can turn them off.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.480]   And if you go into settings, uncheck Animate Background.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.600]   I always--
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.640]   I just-- it looked like they spent more energy on that
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.320]   than actually making a competent client.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   For instance, I think very important to me--
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.360]   now, tell me maybe I missed this setting.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.120]   I like notifications, but I only
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.040]   want to be notification about direct messages.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.920]   And most of these Twitter-- a lot of Twitter clients,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.440]   it's either on or off.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.200]   But the ones I use, like Twitteroid and C's
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.080]   make, you can be notified just for DMs.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.520]   Can you do that in this client?
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.680]   Or is notification globally on or off?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.360]   You can do it.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.000]   So in settings, under notifications,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.080]   you can set it to notify you about new tweets,
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.800]   new mentions, or new DMs.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.560]   I just want DMs.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.800]   I don't want mentions.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.400]   So you can uncheck the other two and just get-- yeah.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.800]   And you can have the notification light, you know, glow,
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.840]   get glowy, five free--
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.720]   There's the choice of tweets, mentions, DMs.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   You vibrate or not notify light on or off.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.220]   OK.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:23.720]   All right, I missed that.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.220]   That's good.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.080]   That notification ringtone.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.400]   And it supports multiple accounts?
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.200]   It does not.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.920]   That's my main complaint about it.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.360]   It does not support multiple accounts, unless I miss that.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.040]   I like the UI of it.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.280]   The multiple accounts thing is a problem.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.480]   What I really like is that it integrates your Twitter
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.280]   contacts with your Android contacts.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:42.720]   That's good.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.360]   So if I'm going to call Adam, like, you know,
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.760]   better at Life Hacker, and I pull up his contact,
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.960]   I can see-- he doesn't use Facebook,
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.880]   but I can see his last Twitter update, which is great.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.440]   Because you can be like, you know, if the last Twitter
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.400]   update was like, oh, I took my dog poofy to them,
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.360]   but then, you know, to the vet, I can say, hey, how was
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:56.360]   your--
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:56.860]   How's poofy?
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.360]   Right.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:57.860]   How's poofy?
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:58.360]   Right.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.280]   That kind of six sets you get using Twitter, which is--
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:00.640]   OK.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.440]   So the contact integration is super sweet.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:02.800]   I like that.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.600]   And the Facebook app does that as well.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.000]   So when I saw that Facebook did that, when two, one came out,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.240]   I was like, oh, I want this for Twitter,
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.720]   because most of my friends use Twitter.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.600]   And the other thing that I really like-- and Leo, maybe this
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.320]   is going on in other clients, and I just missed it--
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.080]   to turn on location when you tweet is a one--
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.240]   you know, is a toggle that's on by default, which is kind of
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:24.440]   sweet.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.240]   It's on by default, which is an issue.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.720]   And these are on by default, which is an issue,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.080]   but it's a very simple--
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.760]   You don't have to do it on a per tweet basis.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.720]   You can do it globally.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.640]   Where do I get to the--
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.680]   No, no, actually, it is on a per tweet basis.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.440]   Now where--
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.920]   Oh, where's that?
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   Where's that?
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.360]   Oh, so yeah, location off, location on.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.920]   It's a little toggle button next to create.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.120]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.480]   This is a site designed for people with good eyes
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.720]   and skinny fingers.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.080]   Fat figure problem is really a problem on this thing,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.880]   because you want to get into that little tiny thing,
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:56.720]   and then it's--
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   I can't throw it on the other side.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.520]   That's kind of my problem.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.640]   I don't really like it too, Gina, but--
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.200]   It's kind of my problem with the Nexus one in general,
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.800]   Android in general, because it's a little bit fiddly.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.360]   Little digitizer needs to be better.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.800]   It's going to be crazy for it.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.440]   It needs to be moved away from the keys, Dylan.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.480]   Right.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.960]   All right, I'm reinstalling it.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.160]   I went back to seismic.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.520]   I'm reinstalling it.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.400]   I do-- I turn on location generally globally,
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.280]   but you're right.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.840]   If you're at home and you don't want people to know
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.760]   where your home is, that's not a good idea.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.260]   Right.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.560]   So you should have control over that.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.800]   That's the key to problem.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.440]   Yeah, because you'll forget at some point.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.240]   Someday you'll forget.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.640]   I have.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.040]   Kevin Marks made a good point, which
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.280]   is that this Twitter client tracks on red tweets
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   and on red mentions.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.120]   That's important.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.520]   That number, that on red number, which is generally
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.440]   different than what Twitter has done up until now.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.960]   Up until now, it's just kind of in the stream that flows by,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.840]   and you don't have that on red tweet guilt thing happening.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.800]   So I don't know.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.040]   That's something I wish that you could turn on and off.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.360]   I'll see things on my desktop.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.880]   And then look at my phone and be like,
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.080]   oh, I've got to look at these things again,
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.320]   because they're listed as on red.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.760]   I think on a phone, one of the things
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.520]   that I look for in a Twitter client is that it will
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.280]   cache previous tweets.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.960]   So that if you haven't--
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.520]   a lot of them, it's just, well, this
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.240]   is what you saw when you logged in last time,
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.800]   and this is what you saw this time.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.440]   And I want to kind of keep it running.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:16.960]   At least tweet it.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.440]   You would show you the jagged line to show you
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.520]   there's something missing here, and you can download it.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.320]   Or maybe that's seismic.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.120]   Seismic does that, I think.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.520]   No, tweet does that.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.160]   Some of them do this better than others.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.440]   But others, you just suddenly jump.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.840]   You lost 40 hours.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.000]   I don't know what happened then.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.880]   You can't get it.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.800]   There's a sync Twitter data checkbox in the settings.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.560]   I believe that that is the--
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.720]   oh, there's sync contacts, and there's sync Twitter data.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.000]   So I'm not sure what sync Twitter data does, actually.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.520]   But the context sync is--
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.640]   Context sync is the killer feature.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:47.960]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.840]   Worth installing it considering it's free.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.960]   And then just not using it.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.000]   If you want to use something else,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.080]   at least you're going to have the context sync in there.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.480]   Right.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:55.840]   Right.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.200]   And you get the choice to sync with only the context
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.600]   you have on your phone, all your Twitter friends,
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.520]   or not to include Twitter data with your context.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.640]   So that's pretty sweet.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.280]   And I think that Froyo is actually going to have Twitter
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.480]   capabilities built in.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.920]   So you're going to be able to tweet something,
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:16.200]   like from Core code in Android, which is really nice.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.680]   I think I was just kind of-- it was the blue user interface
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.480]   in the floating clouds that really turned me off.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.080]   So I'm going to take a--
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.000]   Well, too, FruFruFruFruFruFruFruFruFruFruFruF.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.920]   I've been using Tuit Droid, which has the world's ugly--
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.280]   You want this, absolutely.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.080]   --is Twitter app.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.560]   There's an old Bobby Slaton joke,
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.120]   services that can be in that no man can sound masculine,
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.320]   ordering a petty melt.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.480]   It's the same problem here.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.880]   None of us can sound masculine saying Twitter.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.200]   I could just hear Bobby.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.800]   And his gravelly voice saying that.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.040]   Yeah, I just love Bobby Slaton.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.520]   Reply, retweet, favorite chair.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.240]   And of course, among other things,
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.520]   you're going to have to use-- I'm sure
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.040]   Twitter is retweet instead of the via of the R.G.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.880]   I love the fact that I have the choice in Cismic.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.120]   I'm thinking of Cismic.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.760]   No, which one is it?
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.800]   Almost all of them allow you the choice now.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   But of course, Twitter is not because they want everybody
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.840]   to use their retweet.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.240]   And that share button, which I had never really played with
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.000]   before.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.080]   What is that to--
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.560]   So I use Paper Droid, which is like a Cismic Read-It-Later.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.200]   You can actually save a tweet to your Read-It-Later list,
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.240]   which is huge.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.320]   Oh my god.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.480]   Not only that, but if you've installed things like Pixel
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.560]   Pipe, I could save it to share it with Tousismic.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.160]   Which is a little disorienting.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.120]   That's fantastic.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.760]   And I can send it to Delicious.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.920]   It doesn't do Instapaper.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.600]   I'm an Instapaper guy.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.640]   If you have-- I'm not sure--
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.280]   Maybe I have to install Instapaper on here.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.440]   You have to install an Instapaper or an app that
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.160]   supports Instapaper.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.200]   I'm not sure if there's an app that supports it.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.520]   I use Paper Droid, which supports Read-It-Later, which I use.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.760]   You use Read-It-Later.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.720]   So it does see what you-- I can even do it to Google Buzz.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.840]   This is great.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.760]   Yeah, and that share menu is totally pluggable
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.200]   by any--
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   That's fantastic.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.320]   Oh, I don't have Delicious on my share menu.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.520]   I must have something installed then that--
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.080]   How do I-- yeah, what do I have to install?
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.920]   Is there Delicious on here?
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.440]   I don't know.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.840]   I don't know why Delicious is in there.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.880]   You have it on yours, all right?
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.040]   Do you have it on yours, Gina?
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.680]   No, I don't.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.080]   I have Delicious Facebook, Twitter, email, E-mail, Evernote.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:16.280]   I have--
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.920]   I have-- for example, what you guys maybe put on.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.720]   I have Hawker.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.920]   Yeah, we made you put that on there.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.480]   Yeah, I have--
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.560]   I have Evernote.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.520]   Evernote, I got it.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.560]   I have Google Buzz online.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.400]   You have the Google Buzz app.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.280]   I have WordPress.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.200]   Last pass, PixelPipe Pro.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.880]   It might be PixelPipe Pro installed that,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.280]   because that sends to a lot of places.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.560]   And can I change the font size?
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.040]   Because I'm an old man.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.960]   I don't see it yet.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.600]   It's so tiny.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.480]   That is really tiny.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.600]   Tiny little text.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.840]   And I don't think it does it.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.920]   You can view it tweet on a map.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.800]   That's pretty sweet too.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.840]   These kids today, they just don't understand.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.760]   I don't understand.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   You know, I couldn't--
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.360]   We have.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.480]   Now, what is this tag?
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   Don't be scared.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.200]   Are these trending topics?
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.240]   Yeah, they're like their trending topics or--
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.400]   Too much sugar.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.800]   I can't turn them down.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.040]   A lot of animation.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.600]   See, even with the clouds turned off,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.360]   those little bubbles still keep popping.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.200]   I don't like it for all.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.840]   I don't like it for all.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.680]   I don't like it for all.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.120]   I'm like that.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.560]   Dude, does anybody-- now, this is interesting.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.360]   Does anybody pay any attention to these hashtags anymore?
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:16.840]   No.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   Because they're all--
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.880]   Like, some teens have gotten ahold of them or something.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   They're not--
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   They're like--
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   No, Jonas, quote.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.520]   They got hijacked by the general public, which is fine.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.800]   Oh, real people are using them.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.880]   Oh, that is the problem.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.440]   There's the problem.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.360]   The other good thing that this client does is it will embed--
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.040]   so if there's somebody includes a Twit Pick link,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.640]   it will embed the thumbnail of the photos.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.320]   You can actually see the photo in line between tweets.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.760]   That's another killer feature.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.200]   I really like that.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.560]   Most of the clients I use like Brisley or on the iPad,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.600]   I use Twitter if it will do inline.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.040]   I think that's really great.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.520]   Got a heart and a little phone, but I guess--
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.040]   I guess it's--
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.720]   Yeah, it's small.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.400]   It's pretty small.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.080]   But you can get a sense of what's happening.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:04.960]   It's a little bigger than the person's icon, avatar image.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.840]   So it's small.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.440]   And of course, when you search now for Twitter,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.240]   it's the first thing it shows up because it's called Twitter.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.040]   Yep.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.160]   So that's what everybody was afraid of.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.320]   Yeah, it was a big week for Android apps in general, right?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.840]   So the Twitter client came out and--
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   Dropbox.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.800]   Am I going to steal your--
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.120]   It's OK.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.400]   Go ahead.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.560]   No, I won't steal your tool.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:26.960]   Go ahead.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.720]   Steal my tool.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.280]   It's OK.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.440]   Dropbox and Mint.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.920]   Go ahead.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.560]   Sorry.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.080]   No, no.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:33.580]   No.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.960]   We might as well talk about them.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.440]   We're talking about apps right now.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.280]   I've been waiting for Mint.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.480]   I'm so pleased.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.080]   Me too.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.280]   Me too.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.200]   Really happy about that.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.640]   And you're the one who got me back into Mint,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.800]   because I wouldn't use Mint because I was afraid of giving them
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.360]   all my stuff.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.200]   And then you did the research and you
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.640]   blogged about it on smartmachine.org and said, oh, no,
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.320]   they're using Yodley like all the banks do.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.800]   It's OK.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.360]   Go ahead.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.200]   Gina said it was OK.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.080]   And the good news is that if someone breaks it into your account
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:02.360]   and steals out your money, you'll get an alert about it.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.280]   That's how I look at it.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.120]   At least you'll know.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.760]   I said, when their email system doesn't go down--
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.260]   Right.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:08.760]   Or my case--
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.800]   So hackers take down the email alert system
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.680]   if you decide to break into the system.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.000]   First thing to disable.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.840]   So there's not a lot of settings in here.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.160]   You've got a pretty basic set of settings,
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.520]   but you can change the notifications.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.280]   You can turn off the animation.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.400]   You can at least say, I want to use Bitly.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.880]   And I presume I can give it my API.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   No, I can't.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.560]   That's a flaw.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.560]   So let me use Bitly for my URL shortening service.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.640]   But I like to be able to say, well, OK,
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.520]   but use my Bitly account as well so I can track it.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.020]   Right.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.520]   Right.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.600]   Yeah, the URL shortening service and the photo upload service
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.960]   also, the choices are a bit limited.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.440]   Well, I always use Wi-Frog because I don't like it
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.840]   that they need a Twit pick.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.160]   That's just a little thing of mine.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.560]   You don't have to do that.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.360]   All right.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.280]   It's OK.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.920]   But I have to say that the couple of good killer
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.080]   features are inline photos and sync with your contacts.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   That's good.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.200]   Nice job.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.720]   Dropbox, I think, is significant.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:10.320]   Dropbox did an iPad version and did an Android version.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.680]   And what that means is really they're bringing cloud storage
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.280]   to these platforms, particularly important for the iPad.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:18.800]   Very important.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.120]   It's what I should have done.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.240]   It's expected.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.160]   Google Docs needs to be as good as Dropbox is.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.800]   I agree.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.920]   I mean, you can't upload any arbitrary--
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.800]   You can, but they have to do the kind of computer
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.240]   computer syncing that Dropbox does so instantly.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   I use a Mac and a PC side by side,
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.040]   and I save things to a Dropbox between them.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.840]   And it's literally instantaneous with the desktop clients.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.960]   But I imagine the same thing will be with the iPad.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.920]   And if you have a file in here, you can then
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.600]   get it into other applications by opening them
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.760]   from those applications.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.240]   It's pretty flexible.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.520]   It's-- they have camera settings.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.040]   That's too bad.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.520]   This is the iPad version.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.680]   This really is cloud storage for the iPad
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.920]   now for the Android phone.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.440]   And that's what's great, because it's on the iPhone.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.000]   It's on the iPad.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.520]   It's on the Android.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.000]   It's on Mac.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.520]   It's on Windows.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.080]   It's everywhere.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.560]   We use Dropbox all the time.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.000]   I paid for a 50 gig box, because it's just a very handy thing
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.480]   to have.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.760]   I don't think-- I've been trying to.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.040]   And I don't think--
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.720]   I thought MP3s would play.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.480]   I don't know if they do.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.600]   Maybe it's just--
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.080]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:33.960]   Let me see.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   Because that's pretty cool if you can have Dropbox storage
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.120]   with an MP3 in it.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.760]   I don't hear anything coming out.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   It did launch quick time, though.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.480]   Well, I don't hear any sound.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.840]   So maybe it just doesn't do that.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.240]   That's something they could fix, though.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.800]   I think that the Apple lets you do that.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.400]   And then Mint--
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.800]   Apple will let you play it.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.400]   And you think--
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.000]   Apple will-- I believe Apple permits that.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.080]   And you'll have to check.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.080]   You'll have to check.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   All right, all right.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.840]   Did you see Ellen Gineris got in trouble for her?
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.760]   I missed.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.160]   She did a parody of the iPhone.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:12.600]   What's that funny?
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.040]   It was a parody ad.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.240]   And first of all, Apple has no standing
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.960]   to say anything about it.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.760]   I missed this.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.560]   What did she do?
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.680]   Did she do a skater in her show?
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   Well, it was OK with a little long,
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.400]   but it just said, why do we do everything
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.360]   and then she can't do anything?
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.160]   She can't figure it out.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.840]   Whoops.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.720]   And she actually apologized, which is--
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.880]   And she's next day an apologize.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.600]   Which may be mean that she just wants
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.000]   to keep getting free laptops.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.760]   Or it may--
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.880]   Because it's--
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.800]   Yeah, there's no--
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.720]   --making it a witch.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.680]   Yes.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.880]   Is that since our last show, the John Stewart
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.600]   appealed to Steve Jobs?
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.080]   Yes.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.800]   I mean, yeah.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.480]   God, I think that's a sea change for the company, I think.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:52.760]   Go ahead.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.880]   Tell us about it.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.560]   Well, I think most everybody in this audience
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.560]   has surely seen it, where Stewart just said, I love you.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.120]   I love you, Steve.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:58.640]   I love Apple.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.840]   But don't go Howard Hughes on us.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.800]   You know, what's this world happening?
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.520]   You're bashing down doors.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:11.080]   And Commandant Gates is putting up mosquito nets.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.480]   The world is backwards.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   He called them app holes.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.760]   It was really, brilliantly, accurately devastating,
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.200]   I thought.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.120]   I'll play a little bit of it.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.800]   Why not?
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.760]   John, you won't sue me, will you, if a comedy central loves
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   twig.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   [CHEERING]
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   By halfway up.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.600]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.920]   We got a barn burn on the show tonight.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.600]   Can't watch this on an iPad anymore.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.160]   And at that point, Gizmodo Guy gives him back their phone.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.600]   And the story ends--
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   Red Team Alpha, swarm, swarm, swarm.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.040]   My tech crime investigation team goes to this guy's house,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.400]   the editor of Gizmodo, and has a search warrant,
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.680]   and raids at the officers, bashed into his front door
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.560]   while he was at dinner.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.920]   [CHEERING]
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.360]   The word is Apple.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.680]   Now, I wonder if Apple sent him a cease and desist.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.160]   The cops had to bash you in the guy's door.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   Don't they know there's an app for that?
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:14.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   Ram it.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.440]   So I think he's making a good point,
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.280]   although there's no evidence that Apple, in any way,
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.800]   incited this investigation.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.040]   I mean, everybody assumes that it was that Apple's behest,
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.880]   but there's no--
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.400]   I mean--
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.480]   But Apple could call it off and say, don't be--
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.360]   They can't call it off.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.000]   It's the Attorney General, the Attorney General,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.760]   or whoever it is.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.360]   The sheriff, I don't know who it is, the prosecutor.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.600]   But the private security forces that went to the guy--
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.400]   Stop private.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.480]   Stop private.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.440]   Not Chen's house.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.880]   The other house was a private security force.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.040]   That's the thing, man.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:52.960]   Hired by whom?
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.040]   So--
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.680]   All right, Apple.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.040]   Apple hired a private security force--
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.800]   That's where the--
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.720]   To invade this guy's--
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.960]   No, he's talking about Jason Chen.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.720]   Not on the age of trying to get in, to knock on his door
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.280]   and try to get in.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.640]   They didn't bash down that door.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.140]   Oh.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.560]   This is where Mr. or Mrs. Joke, the great thing
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.720]   about the private security force,
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.600]   is they have the neatest thunguns.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.040]   Let's see.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:12.440]   Let's see.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.120]   We got to watch now.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.760]   This is your bad--
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.360]   That's backup is not--
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.400]   So the Gizmodo reviewer gets the meth lab in the basement
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.280]   treatment after it already given the phone back.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.160]   It's before this point?
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.520]   Everything was OK with the guy who found the phone in the first--
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.960]   That's where he screamed into his wrist.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.320]   The lawyer's dot com is reporting people
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.080]   claiming to represent Apple showed at the finder's
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.200]   address and asked to search the premises.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:33.800]   This is it.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.400]   OK, that's creepy.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.040]   That's it.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.400]   Although the thing about Apple's cops,
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.920]   they have the coolest tasers.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.400]   I didn't hear that part of the story.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.280]   But they didn't have a search warrant.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.840]   They weren't a governmental agency.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.280]   They--
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.240]   They're a--
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.680]   They forgot.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.920]   So some guy goes and says, can I have the phone back?
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.400]   I mean--
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.640]   So they already had the phone back.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.280]   What were they doing?
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.400]   Intimidating him?
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.080]   That's the issue.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.600]   Well, well--
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.440]   OK.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.160]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.160]   I tweeted-- you know, when did Apple lose their sense of humor?
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.960]   And somebody says, tweeted back.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.600]   They've always had it.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.680]   They just have to improve the jokes.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.320]   I think there's-- I mean, I'm not going to defend Apple.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.440]   But I do think that there's a little bit of the people
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.560]   are leaving a conclusion that Apple stimulated
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.800]   the criminal investigation.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.200]   We don't know that.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.640]   Well, they were going to find out because they've been
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.200]   FOIA's filed with the cops on this.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.280]   Oh, interesting.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   Like, what did you--
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   We'll find out more.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   We'll see.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   Well, why did you do this?
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   I think Stuart was in line though.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.200]   I think that they are-- you know, they're-- how are you using?
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   He's how are you using?
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   I love him.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200]   Steve, I love you.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   But he's how are you using?
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   It is, after all, just a phone prototype.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.080]   It's not-- it's not the Pentagon papers.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.280]   And meanwhile, Ellen DeGeneres does a spoof on iPhone commercials.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.880]   And Apple says, hey.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.200]   But now see, there is a difference here.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.920]   Apple advertises on the Ellen show.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   Right.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   So that's different.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.520]   I mean, if an advertiser-- if I said something bad about an advertiser and they complain,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.520]   I might apologize.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.000]   I just got an update to tell me if this is new.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.920]   Wall Street Journal says that FCC Commission Chairman Julius Jadakowski has decided to re-regulate
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.280]   internet lines to protect net neutrality.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   So he's redefining what internet is, reclassifying it in his title, too.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   Good.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   That's true.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   That's true.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   That's true.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   This is in response to that--
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   Like, okay.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:36.920]   The court case where they lost the Comcast judgment because the District of Columbia Circuit Court
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.200]   of Appeals said, it's not really.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.960]   That's not none of your business.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   You don't have the authority.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.040]   You're in the lower board here, FCC.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.200]   None of your business.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.080]   And then, of course, the FCC, it's a completely reasonable response, which is saying, no,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.800]   no, we are chartered to cover this, and that's what this is.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   Right.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   Phone lines.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.680]   If anybody sees me getting up every once in a while, it's because my light thinks I'm
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.760]   dead, and so I have to move and do it.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   Technology.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.960]   Cooney is obviously on a frugal kick.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.240]   It's worse than that right now because we had, after the Times Square bomber, we then
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.600]   had nervousness because right here on 40th Street where I am, a manhole cover fire of
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.440]   major proportion came in.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.440]   We lost our power.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.440]   I don't have air conditioning right now.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440]   No.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.440]   I'm sweltering.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.240]   Like three stories, highs, flames, right?
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240]   No, it wasn't.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.480]   That happens every once in a while.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.280]   A manhole cover goes shooting in the air.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   That's what I love about New York.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280]   That's what I encourage everyone to say.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.920]   Everyone kept saying, oh, that happens in New York all the time.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.720]   I was like, three story flames happen all the time in New York.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   When?
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   I don't know.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   You got rats to size.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   You got a bigger here.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   No.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   See, alligators in a suit.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720]   You got the twist.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   You went out to the West Coast.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.280]   I got a Google exploding manhole covers.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.920]   We'll just see if we can find some video on that.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.080]   How stuff works has a page called How Exploding Manholes Work.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.080]   It starts.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.920]   Manhole covers have been blasting out of the ground in New York City.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   This apparently isn't that uncommon.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   Wow.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.680]   50 feet in the air.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.960]   An 85 pound manhole cover can become a missile when blasted out of the ground.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.360]   How much are terrorists that?
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.440]   Hey, does it bother you that the response?
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.280]   Let me ask you, because you live in Manhattan or you work in Manhattan, that the response
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.080]   to the Times Square bomb is let's put up more cameras.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.400]   No, I'm fine.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   You don't mind that.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.600]   Don't forget, Leo, I was also at the World Trade Center on the last train in on 9/11.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.080]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.480]   And no, I'm fine with it.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   I'm just suckers.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   I'm in public.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   It is public.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   It is public.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.320]   It's like, yeah, it's good in public.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.720]   And I couldn't be happier with it.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   I do not want to depend my life on God bless him, but I don't want to put my life on and
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.520]   the city's life on the backs of a t-shirt vendor.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.640]   Okay, you're right.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   Good point.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.720]   As a New Yorker, who was also nearby, the trade center on 9/11, I agree more cameras, whatever.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   Okay.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   There's be like Britain as far as I'm concerned.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.520]   And by the way, the t-shirt better should now sell t-shirts and say if you see it, say,
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.080]   if you see something, say something.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Definitely.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.640]   So this is how a manhole cover explodes gas builds up.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.400]   Then damaged insulation causes wiring.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.240]   Is this demand media?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   Is this demand media?
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.280]   No, this is how stuff works.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.600]   This is like, how stuff works is a great site.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   This is a great site.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.880]   This is the lady to Leo's new show, This Week in Terrorism.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.720]   But did you know there are 13,000, there are 13,000 volt power cables in there?
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.240]   Well, the cables, they had to take all these cables and straighten for me.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   They are awesome cables.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.440]   They are incredible cables.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.080]   And so the gas, you know, if the gas accumulates and there's a spark from the cable, the manhole
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.720]   cover goes 50 feet in the air.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.840]   What's the big deal?
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   But I wouldn't stay.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   You gotta pop with that.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   Hey, what do you want?
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   Hey, what?
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.120]   Hey, just a manhole cover.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.960]   I would stand on a manhole cover as a, you know, a matter of course.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.520]   The other thing that happens here in the winter is the snow and the salt mix and then get
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.440]   electricity on them and dogs die on them.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.840]   Or dogs and their paws on them.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.840]   Oh, dear.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   I made those grids.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.840]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   That's terrible.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840]   God, New York.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.840]   Look at town.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   It's a place to live.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   YouTube is going to start running videos.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.480]   Do we talk about that last week?
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.120]   We mentioned it briefly.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   Okay.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.080]   We knew about that.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.800]   Google acquired bump top.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.120]   I thought this was very interesting.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:52.800]   This is a very fancy looking, I thought it was for Linux only.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   Window manager.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   It's not.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800]   It's for other operating systems.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.680]   I definitely beta tested a very early build on Windows.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.680]   Okay.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.680]   Yep.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.680]   So what does tell, describe it?
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.200]   Gosh, it was a really long time ago, but it's, I guess it's Mac as well.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   It's kind of a different.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.720]   It's kind of, it's just a really fancy eye catchy flying kind of UI.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.400]   It's not like a touch UI, but it's kind of like what you'd imagine a touch UI.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.840]   I got to find a video here.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.080]   It's three dimensional stuff flies in and out.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.240]   Is there a touch to this?
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   Is this where this goes?
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   Yeah, it's touched too.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   Yes.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.240]   Isn't it?
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   Actually, there is touch support.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.720]   I didn't have a machine that would support that, but yes.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.600]   And this would be for, what do you think, for a tablet?
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   Perhaps.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   Hmm.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   Hmm.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   Hmm.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.000]   You may, there is a TED talk with, you could see the bump top.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.640]   There's a, there's a video on a, yeah, but this is like from the top.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.360]   There's a thing like we haven't heard anything from them in a long time.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.640]   So the idea is your desktop looks like this.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.880]   And now can on your computer to be a complete mess and you drag stuff around.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.880]   Oh, I like the bling.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   Right.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.080]   You guys have round and it's got that angle 3D.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   Right.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.560]   And you could lasso icons and move them and fan them out.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560]   That's right.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560]   That's right.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.720]   Jeff Raskin was working on something a little similar to this.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   Yes, he was.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.320]   And I was, I was concerned that I was going to get confused with his, uh, his touchy
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   eye.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   Hmm.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.880]   Yeah, I would be good for a tablet.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.600]   I'd like that on a tablet, wouldn't you?
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.600]   Sure.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   Anything.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   Anything.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   Let's see.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   What else?
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.880]   FTC may be fighting Google's acquisition of AdMob.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.560]   I think it's imminent to the decision.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   I can understand that.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.960]   But if Apple's got I add, yeah, I think most of the most of the commentary I've seen for
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.720]   people who you would think would be against the acquisition or say, no, let this one through.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.920]   In fact, that's why Google was so happy about I add.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.200]   It meant, well, there's see there's competition in this in this market.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:14.080]   Well, Apple wasn't happy about losing AdMob, but they found something else.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.440]   Apple's just not happy about much.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   They're cranky.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   Yeah, they are.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.680]   Um, it did sell a million iPads.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.800]   Yeah, no, they're doing all right in the iPad.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.280]   They're making a lot of money on the iPad.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.800]   It's a way to get a million people can figure out how to use it and you can't drivers.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.600]   I'm sending it back.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.000]   It looks like Google TV at IO.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.320]   So Google is invested in something called an ad TV ad startup called in Viti.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:52.120]   $23 million, in fact, series defunding led by Google with group M Motorola, Menlo Ventures,
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.040]   InterWest and Entertech Capital, a bunch of venture partners.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   So it's not all from Google.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.920]   What does in Viti do?
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.760]   They offer a digital set tops box application that delivers targeted advertising and marketing
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.560]   messages to individual viewers.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.040]   So you'll get custom ads the next time you watch Glee.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.520]   Google keeps trying to get into display and trying to get into TV.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.240]   You know, I was talking to an executive believer named in a big media company who said that
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.040]   Google kind of promised years ago never to go into display advertising into brand advertising
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.680]   and that if they come in and take the same share there, that's going to kill media is
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   what it's said.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.640]   But I think they had an only choice to.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   They're going to be an advertising.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.040]   They're going to be in these other areas.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.640]   So your prediction for Google IO is that they will do a TV.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   What will it be?
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   Do you think Gina?
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.000]   Android set top box or a build of Android, which is going to be a media center if the
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.960]   box itself doesn't doesn't come out.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.040]   It's kind of a ho hum announcement to be honest with you.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.680]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff like this.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.360]   There's box like Apple TV Apple TV, which has never succeeded.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.040]   I think it's a pretty ho hum announcement.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.600]   And Microsoft tried for years to get the cable companies to do a Windows based set top box.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.840]   And the problem with this and I presume would be true of Android is that these make them
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840]   too expensive.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.200]   You have to put too much hardware, too much processing, too much RAM in a set top box.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.480]   These things have to be dirt cheap.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   You don't want a smart set top or not at least not that smart set top box.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.880]   Maybe times have changed.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   I don't know.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   Interesting.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880]   I don't know.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   I'm excited.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.720]   I'm like that market, you know, the Android app market on my TV.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.520]   That's kind of interesting to me.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.360]   Yeah, I think that that could open things up.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.240]   The problem is you're not going to get it on to your cable box.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.080]   It's like a little as others.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.240]   It's an added box.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.240]   Right.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.840]   So now it's like Boxy or Roku or something like that.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.840]   The boxy.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840]   My sort of best.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   I'm not really a media center geek.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   I should qualify that.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.000]   But my best kind of media center experience was with XMBMC and Boxy Boxy.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.960]   It's just a fork of XBMC.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.600]   So I just, I don't know, it feels like an open development platform like Android, you know,
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.320]   and the Android market just a lot of potential.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.880]   Yeah, who's ahead of them in this market?
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.080]   In this market is Yahoo of all people.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:11.880]   A number of television manufacturers, Panasonic, Samsung, make Yahoo widget enabled TVs.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.520]   And you know, nowadays most televisions are computers.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.720]   They have an ethernet port.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.560]   They have processors.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.840]   They're doing a lot of work anyway.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.320]   There's a cell processor in one of the new Toshiba TVs.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.640]   I mean, that's how much power they put in this thing.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.960]   And it just, that's where you put it.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.280]   You put it in the TV.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.680]   You don't try to get through the cable company.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.920]   You don't try to sell it through Apple or, you know, Lynx's as you put it in the TV.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   Samsung sells it.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.600]   Comes with the TV.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.880]   And then I think there'll be a brisk competition there.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.640]   By the way, it will not just be Google in that one.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.080]   And that will push the cloud more and more because you, when the TV everywhere structure
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.000]   the different architecture of this that once you bought the show, you should be able to
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   get it across those devices.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.200]   The only problem with the guy who did Web TV has been pushing for the last couple of years
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.840]   something called OnLive.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.680]   Similar idea.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.600]   It's basically server-side gaming.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.040]   So all the rendering, all the heavy-duty hardware is server-side.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.160]   And they just send a stream down of the game so you can use an inexpensive television or
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.360]   even a device about the size of an iPhone to play these games.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.320]   It's called OnLive.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   We've been waiting for this for a while.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.040]   And the beta tests have been kind of underwhelming.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.600]   But if you think about it, there's a way to make a lot of money is you put games on
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.040]   these things.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.400]   Google just bought a company called RecordedFuture that tries to predict the future.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.200]   I think that's a good thing to buy.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   Google Company.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   You could invest in it.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.080]   Yeah, this is such a Google Company, right?
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.040]   So the idea is they're trying to, just like a weather forecast.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.440]   Go farther with the future we already have.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.840]   Look, if Google starts prediction in the future, I'm worried.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.920]   It'd be for financial markets like a weather report.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:58.320]   You could say, what's IBM's stock price going to be tomorrow or next month?
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.840]   Who's going to do the next IPO in television widgets?
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.640]   I wonder how accurate you can get.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.040]   It's an interesting acquisition.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   It's probably very speculative, right?
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040]   Well, it is interesting.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   Yeah, you can predict things.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040]   If it works.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.120]   It's just like Google's in the best position to do this, right?
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.160]   Because they have all this data.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.560]   And actually, this app appears to have a lot of plug-ins.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560]   It uses Google charts and things.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.760]   I don't know if it was about their algorithms or what.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.920]   Maybe you put it in the sidebar.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.160]   That's the next thing in the sidebar.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.160]   You got the real-time timeline last week, last month, yesterday, tomorrow.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.160]   Right, tomorrow.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.960]   What's going to happen tomorrow?
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.880]   Well, you go to the fact, this story early time, said about a month ago, that the Twitter
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.520]   discussion about movies is 97.3% accurate and predicting box on this.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.520]   Interesting.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520]   How accurate?
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   93%.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   97.3%.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   I don't really think that.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.520]   There's your number.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.520]   There's your number.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520]   Thank you.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.520]   Done.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520]   Wow.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.520]   That's impressive.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.040]   While we're on predicting the future, if you saw Conan O'Brien spoke at Google and his
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.840]   tweet was, and I quote, "I'm in San Jose and I'm going to visit Google.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:13.720]   If I look up Google on Google from Google, you see the face of God."
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.800]   That's the programmer joke.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.640]   If you Google recursion on Google, what do you get?
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   Did you mean recursion?
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   Did you mean recursion?
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.560]   Well, I mean, Google started to get a little bit of this prediction thing with the flu
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560]   trends, right?
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.480]   So they could predict where the flu out was happening based on search queries for symptoms
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   in different areas.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.480]   I don't know.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.800]   I guess that's not really a prediction as much as a just trend spotting.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   Right.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800]   Well, what's the difference?
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   Well, but you're going to the next step.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.360]   You're seeing where does this curve lead you?
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   Right.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360]   Right.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.080]   Dane's going to put this story in our rundown until we do it.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.880]   So I'm going to do it right now.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:59.840]   Google Street View driver caught peeing on Google Street View.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.000]   If you look at the Google Street, I don't know where it's a Street View 4.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.320]   Somewhere in the middle of freaking nowhere near rewind of that.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.240]   One, two, three, four, nine, no wonder he felt safe to do it there.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240]   There's no one around.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.200]   In fact, if you scroll around, you'll see there's the open car door for the Street View car.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.560]   And there ain't nobody else around.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.360]   And there he is.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.680]   So that's when you start, you can't stop.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680]   Well, that's right.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.680]   That's right.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.640]   I wonder, you know, maybe you left the car in gear and just slowly rolling.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.600]   That's pretty funny.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.040]   Google Street View caught in its own mall.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.160]   Well, if it's good enough for us, it's good enough for everybody.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.360]   That's right.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.480]   Big gains for Chrome in the browser wars.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:53.280]   In fact, according to Mashable, Chrome is gaining while Internet Explorer is slumping.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.760]   What's Firefox doing?
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.160]   Firefox is holding steady.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:03.960]   Firefox went from 24.5% to 24.5%.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.960]   Google's Chrome though gained half a point.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.760]   10% improvement.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.720]   That's a month to month, fifth month in a row.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720]   I love Chrome.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   I do.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   I love Chrome.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.680]   It's fast, it's lightweight, very reliable.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.440]   I've been very happy with it.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.720]   One thing I wish is that when I accidentally hit the red button on top and I close all
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.560]   the windows, most of the time, if you open a tab right away, it'll let you reopen all
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560]   those windows.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560]   It'll know that you did it.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   It then crashes.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.280]   It'll restore for you.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.960]   But once in a while, I lose all my tabs.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.680]   Mashable points out though, while in general, the Chrome usage in the worldwide market is
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.920]   6%, it went from 6.13 to 6.73.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.920]   Among Mashable users, 12.6 to 14.8%.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920]   Mashable users love Chrome.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.560]   I bet you, if I look, I should look at the Twit numbers.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.760]   I bet you see a big spike as well.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.520]   Huge, huge number of Chrome users probably.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.640]   It'll change the next two minutes because you told people.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.400]   Go get Chrome, install it.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.440]   You bring down a Google server, Leo.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.080]   That's your macho goal.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   All right.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   That's my goal.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   That would be a serious accomplishment.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.680]   You'll see the Google cops.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   Not gonna.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.680]   What kind of tasers will they have?
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.240]   Open source ones.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.000]   One last story, then we'll get to your tip tool and number.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.480]   That story is from Rupert Murdoch.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.760]   The subscription plan is coming.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   Paid content.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   Do it already.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   Really?
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760]   He likes talking.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.800]   Rupert loves the talk.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   He's planning.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.480]   He's arguing now that the iPad, well, you know, is kind of their salvation.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.840]   We got all this money from the iPad, 64,000.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.920]   He's used the word "savior."
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.480]   Because he doesn't use the internet.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.480]   It's a savior.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.160]   I won't be given a press conference in about three to four weeks in which we'll have some
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.480]   important announcements.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480]   Google.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.480]   I mean, Murdoch said.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.960]   Three to four weeks.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.640]   Well, you know, why do you announce a press conference in three to four weeks?
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.520]   I don't know.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.200]   Will it be a competitor to iTunes Store?
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.360]   I guess so.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.160]   An extension of it.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.760]   I don't know what that means.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   We just like to confirm.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.120]   The, you know, Murdoch started a New York section in the Wall Street Journal to compete
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.480]   with the New York Times.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.480]   It's rather laughable.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.480]   It's not good.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.760]   But he didn't really down the care of this whether it's good.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.840]   He just wants to nudge the New York Times.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.240]   Maybe a new amount of business.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.960]   He says that the Wall Street Journal app has 64,000 paid subscribers.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:29.960]   So that's what it's like.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.680]   Yeah, but that's a fake too because I went in and I downloaded it because I was already
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   a journal subscriber.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680]   I think he counted me.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.880]   I didn't pay X three yet.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880]   But I did too.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   And then three days later it said now even though you subscribe to the paper edition and
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.080]   the web edition, we want more money.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.280]   And that's when I deleted it from my iPad.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.520]   Well, even when I was reading it, it still said, you know, this story, you can read the
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.960]   story you can't.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960]   It's very frustrating.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.480]   Well, let me just see.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   I'm just curious.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   I mean, that doesn't sound like a huge number.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   Let me do.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   He's right.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   He's basically not all that money goes to us.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.480]   It doesn't go to Amazon.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.480]   There's no middle man.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.880]   So I went 64,000 times $18.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.160]   Hey, that's some good money.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.480]   That's a $1.15 million a month or something.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.280]   I mean, that's not unless I did my calculations wrong.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.280]   That's pretty good.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:31.040]   If all of those people are paying, yeah, almost a little more than a million dollars a month.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.680]   But I think I saw some more that there were counting people like you and me.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.440]   Oh, well, that doesn't count.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.440]   They can't count me.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440]   I deleted it.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   I sold.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   I give it back.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.560]   So Gina has a good article on Steve Jobs flash open letter.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.240]   Just just go to smarter where and read it.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.000]   So much has happened since we've met last.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.960]   I know a lot of stuff happened.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   Wow.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.720]   And some good comments too.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.840]   Of course, you have the best smart readers on there.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.960]   So some good stuff smarter where.org Steve Jobs on flash.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.680]   Apple shut law law bought Siri.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.960]   We talked about Siri.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.480]   I think we're ready to move on.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   There's so much boy.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.040]   I mean, I got on and on and on here.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040]   There's a ton of news.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.720]   But let's get to Gina's tip of the week because frankly, this show can't go on forever.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.880]   We've got a we've got a train to catch.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.280]   Gina, you got a tip for us.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.160]   My tip is for, I don't know, hopefully I'm not the only one excited about this.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:32.560]   But for those of us who really who still love and use wave, big thing happened this week,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.160]   you can now embed waves onto web pages and anyone who anonymous users who don't have
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.280]   a wave account can see that wave.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.280]   Oh, that's good.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   That's a change.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.000]   Yeah, which is awesome.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.040]   So so you can basically add a real time group chat onto your site.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.200]   And anyone can see it.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.800]   And you can see it actually I wrote up my blog and I made a wave public and it promptly
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.520]   got kind of destroyed.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.440]   I mean, like anarchy, you know, which is wonderful because I love love anarchy.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.720]   Lots of people commenting and chatting, really lots of fun.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.640]   The cool thing though, you can make a wave public so that anybody on wave can comment
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   on it.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.760]   But I've started using, you can restrict edit access to a group, right?
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.280]   So like, so I'm using it now wave for to do office hours with my developers on my open
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.280]   source project.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   Good idea.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:20.800]   So the people in the Google group on my mailing list can edit the way, but I can publish
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.960]   the transcript, you know, an archive it later on a regular web page, which is really,
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   which is really cool.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.480]   So yeah, embedded waves are really a lot of fun.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.120]   So hopefully we're going to see wave out a lot more.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.320]   This will make a difference.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.600]   This will make a big difference.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.800]   People will finally get a chance to look at it, use it in a functional way.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   Definitely.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   That's going to open.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   Cool.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   Smarter word.org.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   Another reason to go.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.520]   Jeff, do we, do we cover your number?
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.480]   No, no, no, no, God bless Dane.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   He's given numbers, then you don't stay away from them.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.120]   Besides the fact that YouTube tops 13 billion views a month.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   That's good news.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   A month?
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   No, video this month.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   Hold on.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   Let me go.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120]   Oh, this month they got 30.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.120]   Hold on.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120]   Hold on.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   Hold on.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.120]   Hold on.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.120]   I just lost the tab myself here.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   Jesus.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120]   I'm an idiot.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.120]   Tom score says that more than 180 million users watched online video during the month.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.840]   You delivered video to more than 135 million viewers, three out of four, every four video
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:22.320]   viewers, an average of 96 viewers, videos per viewer.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320]   That's what's amazing.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.880]   Wow.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:30.400]   So that's, yeah, in the month of March, internet users watched 31.2 billion videos.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.720]   So now Google had a third of that Google TV.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.720]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.720]   It's a lot of sense now.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   Now it makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]   Makes a lot of sense.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Now the volume of video that's there.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.440]   If they can go to advertisers and say, no, no, no, we know when they're watching on the
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   big TV.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.760]   That makes you comfy.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:52.480]   So Google had 41% of all videos viewed online in March, YouTube, of course, the, you know,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.560]   I don't know how much Google video was watched.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.600]   Hulu came in second.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.720]   So, so Google had 13 billion views.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.960]   Hulu had 1.1 billion.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.680]   That's the second place.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.240]   Wow.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   Unbelievable.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.480]   Rightable, isn't it?
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:13.920]   That gives, gives a whole new meaning, the value of YouTube.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.800]   And you, and if I'm doing Hulu, if I'm doing, if I'm a network, I'm wondering, why am I
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.520]   doing my own site?
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   Why am I not using it?
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520]   Where the people are.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.360]   This whole idea, I wrote a post a while ago that I think that the notion that brands are
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.800]   the magnets that draw us is now out loaded.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.760]   Search changed that because we started the transaction.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.760]   That's a good point.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760]   Right.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.240]   Links from Twitter and Facebook.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.640]   We, the humans, start the transaction.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   Right.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.240]   Well, I think brands remain labels once you've found something.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.720]   You still want a brand.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720]   Well, you're a man.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   You still want a brand.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.480]   I mean, you're going to still look for lost.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   But why would you go?
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.360]   Of course, I should have to look for.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.840]   Why doesn't it look for me?
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.760]   On the other hand, I mean, you can still use that argument to say, well, I don't need
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   to live on YouTube.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.960]   I'll, I can live anywhere I want.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960]   It's be embeddable.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.200]   Which is by the way, the smart thing that Twitter did this week is they created the
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   embeddable tweet.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   Hi.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.320]   I'm arguing with newspapers should create embeddable articles.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.840]   What did we learn from YouTube that embedding things all over the web gives you distribution
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.640]   and control at the same time?
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   Right.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   Right.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   And Twitter is doing that.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.320]   And, and I think the lesson here is that's how you get distributed.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.600]   And so that's exactly the lesson.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.000]   That's how YouTube got to be so big.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.520]   Not because everybody goes to it because it comes to us.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:27.040]   So you think the embeddable tweet, I mean, it, it mostly looks cosmetic.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   I guess it's linkable.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.320]   But they, I think it isn't.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.480]   And, and one person in the UK pointed out with their libel laws, if you, if you say something
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.160]   nasty in the tweet and then believe it, it can still be distributed everywhere and
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.520]   still get you in trouble.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.000]   It says, you know, two minutes ago, which in two weeks becomes mean less.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.760]   And I think it was TechCrunch had a post today about another, another way to embed tweets
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.640]   that put a timestamp on it and make it better.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.600]   But I think just the idea simply is right and it's smart.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   So when you know the New York Times complaining about Huffington Post, quoting them too much,
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   well, then make your stories embeddable.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.600]   And they'll put them up there with brand and links and analytics and all kinds of things.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600]   Why not?
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.400]   I mean, YouTube certainly gains from that, don't they?
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.320]   I think this is the, this is the lesson to media.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.400]   But we keep on not hearing it because we think that they come to us.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.280]   That's again, why the iPad is so beloved of the media companies.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   I control you again.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.360]   I control you.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.440]   Our, our tool of the week isn't really a Google tool.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.760]   Although it's a great tool that has come to Android.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.040]   As you mentioned, Gina, it's mint is finally available.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.480]   It was for a long time.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.480]   It's a website.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.280]   You go to mint.com and I'm sure Gina and I both use mint on the web, but it was very
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.960]   nice to be able to get it on the iPhone because mint will tell you things like, you know,
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.520]   you're overdrawn or what's in your accounts right now and having that win your pocket
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.400]   with you all the time is just, is just great.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.800]   I'm not sure I'll show you my mint thing because the first one says, well, you live
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.880]   in public, says, says what, what, how much you owe, what your net worth is and all that
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.880]   stuff.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   It's great though.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:57.280]   I, you know, you can, mint will alert me when, you know, a big check is written.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.600]   I can go through my accounts and see, you know, what's going on and I actually use it as
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.600]   a business person.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.040]   I use it to monitor all my accounts, including my business accounts.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.960]   So it's very handy for that.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.880]   And having it on the phone, it's like, you know, I hate going in a quick end and like
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:12.880]   dealing with all that.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.320]   Like I hate balancing my checkbook, but if I'm like, you know, off in line somewhere at
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.160]   the grocery store, I'm just like, oh, how am I doing?
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.840]   So I have that casual way to just be like, oh, you know, just take the pulse of my bank
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]   accounts in one place.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.080]   Well, and of course it is in a way a cloud story because, uh, Intuit bought mint mint
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   was so successful.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:35.400]   Uh, Intuit bought mint and, um, I suspect this is kind of the, the next quick and I
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.720]   mean, it's kind of the replacement for quick.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.000]   And, um, so really just a handy thing to have.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.320]   I've got 14 new alerts.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:46.600]   It'll tell me, you know, what's overdrawn, whatever it has my budget as my cash flow.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.280]   My total net worth is really nice to have that in your pocket all the time.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:57.880]   And as Gina and I have pretty much ascertained pretty much figured out its safety.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.600]   It's, it's, it's safe enough.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.800]   I think it's car to sort of say it uses it when it, well, it's get a little scary.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.160]   Cause when you first set up mint, you started giving it all your bank account logins, you
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.320]   base and credit car, everything, all your financial information.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.720]   And that's a little nerve wracking, but the mint doesn't save that information itself.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.040]   It uses a service called Yodley, which all the banks use it.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.240]   You know, the truth is Yodley already knows all that stuff because the banks have been
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.240]   using it for years.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   That's a big 90s business.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.640]   It's survived by changing its ways.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.960]   Well, this is part of what that idea of putting somebody having been the guardian of
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.880]   my, my identity, my, my safety that I can trust who then knows one of the things we're
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.200]   done becomes a good, good housekeeping, seal of approval.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.680]   There's a company called, I think it's called JIST.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   You seen that one?
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   No.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.680]   What do they do?
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.480]   Uh, I said what it is.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.640]   Yeah, so, uh, people, the guy who got me on the Howard Stern show, uh, Jeff Schick,
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.680]   when we complained about Lotus made fun of them.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.160]   They, they've done a deal with this company and they say it's wonderful and it takes your
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.480]   email and other things and finds where all it's not, it's not, it's on the web.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.840]   It's not on a, I don't think it's on the phone.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   Remember the web?
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840]   No web.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   What's that?
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   It's on the web.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.880]   And, and the thing is, I was at the point of saying, okay, here's all my email and I thought,
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.840]   no, would, would Gina let me do that?
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:12.840]   What would Gina?
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   What would Gina do?
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840]   What would Gina do?
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840]   We all want to know.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.840]   Does he use a Gmail OAuth or do you have to actually hear you?
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:19.840]   I just want you to tell me, Gina.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.840]   I don't know how it does it.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.840]   So is it jist.com?
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:22.840]   Yeah, it is.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   So it looks like a neat idea and they, they were, they were raving about it.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.160]   But I just had that last minute moment to say, I don't know.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.840]   No more about who you know.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.320]   Yeah, I would, if they use OAuth, I would be fine with that.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.680]   I would, you know, I have certain, certain passwords I'm a little crazy about.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.880]   My Google account password I'm crazy about.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.960]   I wouldn't want to give that 10 third party.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.720]   But, but if it just needs my Gmail, they should be able to just use OAuth, right?
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.120]   Because that's, that's available now in Gmail.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.280]   But, yeah, the other stuff, I don't know.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.880]   I might be a little worried about giving my Twitter account over.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.800]   I mean, it all depends on, you know, what services you really care about and have the
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.880]   stuff that, you know, you're really concerned about it.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.560]   I'm just checking right here.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.960]   I can't do it now.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.760]   I have to activate it.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   I hate it when they have to activate it before I can try it.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.400]   I'm sure everything now uses OAuth.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.520]   I mean, Twitter uses OAuth, Facebook uses OAuth.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.640]   What is XAuth versus Yo-Watt, by the way?
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   I'm unclear on that.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.280]   I think that XAuth is sort of the next generation of OAuth.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.960]   But I think that it's like better, new, improved.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.760]   I'm not exactly sure details.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.680]   Okay, that settles at Christmas scene it will be on next week's show.
