[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040]   This show covers Google, the cloud, and the Google verse
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.960]   joining us right now from his home, where he's been very
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.040]   assiduously watching the Facebook Developer Conference keynote
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.920]   by Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.520]   We've got Kevin Marks from BTBritish Telecom and Ribbit.com.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.120]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.880]   Hi there.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.680]   Nice to see you all again.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.000]   Thanks for joining us on short notice.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.760]   I really wanted to get your thoughts on Facebook's announcements.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.800]   Also here with us, for the first time we're doing a live show
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.600]   now on Wednesdays, and for the first time from his office,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.880]   are you at City University?
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.400]   Yeah, man.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.000]   I wore those lights that are really 10 minutes
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840]   because I'm gone.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.280]   It just happened.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.280]   I love those.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.840]   Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200]   And glad to have you, Kevin.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.520]   Of course, from New York City also, just down the road
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.240]   at peace, we should have gotten you two together.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.440]   Gina Trapani, she's a fast company today.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280]   Hello.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.040]   Yes.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.540]   She does.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.160]   Show us the view.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   Here it is.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.920]   It's pretty.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.420]   It's pretty.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.680]   Oh, isn't that great?
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.080]   That is really kind of gorgeous.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.280]   Pretty good, 29th floor, World Trade Center 7.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.320]   Thanks to Fast Company for hosting me.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.920]   Their conference is actually today as well.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   Oh, good.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.160]   We'll talk about that as well.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.800]   I was at that earlier.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.280]   Gina is, of course, a blogger at smartaward.org.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160]   Her blog sheet was one of the founders of Life Hacker.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.840]   Still writes there.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.320]   And the new book is the complete guide to Google Wave,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.240]   a complete wave guide.com.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.880]   Indeed.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.080]   And she's at fastcompety.com/worksmart.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.120]   She's very serious.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.320]   She's getting together for weekdays.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.640]   She's a lot more serious than Saturday.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   It does.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.440]   I said that we're not as fast.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   Should I be in a suit?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   I got to be in an office.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520]   I got to be up on my stories.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.120]   OK, get silly.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.520]   Get silly.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   Get silly.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.480]   There's nothing--
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.400]   I have colleagues walking by in the hall
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600]   because it's a glass wall.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.560]   And I've got my laptop up on a box
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   so that I have it at eye level.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.760]   And my heads up off.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.280]   I do too.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.200]   You're a local player.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   I can do that.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.520]   Mine's too low.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   I mean, the double-tune company.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.800]   I've got my laptop up on a stack of fast companies.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.720]   High is good.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.920]   High is good.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.280]   The first thing you learn in television
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.440]   is you always shoot from up down, not down up.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.280]   My space angle is good.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.200]   There you go.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.880]   My space.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.280]   Now I'm pose.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.040]   So you don't have double-chins.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.240]   And you always have my head.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   It's like that.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.880]   And then, of course, if you're like a professional news anchor,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.360]   you'll have an eye light, which gets rid of all the bags
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.120]   because there's no wrinkles or anything
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   because everything's so brightly lit.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.120]   So Kevin, you were watching Mark Zuckerberg speak today
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.920]   at the Facebook Developers Conference.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.160]   I didn't realize they were streaming it.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.360]   That's very handy.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   It seems with the trend now.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.720]   I did last week with Chirp as well.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.840]   It can actually sit in your office.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360]   Because if it's the keynote thing,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   you don't get in a lot from being in the room.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.280]   You can't talk to them.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   But you can watch the stream.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   And it's actually easy to track it.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.400]   And you've got Wi-Fi and a comfortable sofa.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.880]   And I'm even more meta because I track it by tracking your tweets.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.320]   So I didn't even know you weren't there.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.720]   I just-- I'm watching your tweet.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.000]   So did Mark announce anything of great interest?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.680]   Oh, there's a bunch of interesting stuff.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.560]   So I can get them all in the right order.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.200]   So they announced what they're calling the open graph.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.480]   And basically, they've changed their API
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.640]   so that you can get access to any information
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.800]   Facebook has with a straightforward REST API.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.960]   They've made it such that any website can become effectively
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.360]   a Facebook fan page by adding metadata to the site
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.000]   and then connecting to that.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   And then the other thing they've added
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.400]   is they've-- instead of having connect,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   they've taken away the name Facebook Connect.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   And they're now got the idea that, rather like we did
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.400]   with Google Friend Connect 80 months ago, two years ago,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.800]   even, you add a little bit of iFrame to your page.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   And that connects to Facebook and then
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.480]   shows you information from Facebook about the pages on.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.960]   But because it's Facebook, it doesn't have
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.000]   to log in because they assume there's
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.880]   only one possible source of information
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.080]   in the world and that's Facebook.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.040]   So I'm like, Google one where you have to log in through Google
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.720]   or your Facebook or whatever.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.480]   This one is like, no, you're logged into Facebook.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.880]   So there's a little iFrame on the page
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.640]   that shows you if your friends have visited that page
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.240]   and liked it or other information about the page
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.600]   that Facebook has about it.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.760]   Is it a one-way street or is it also--
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.880]   is that potentially a way for, I think it is,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.000]   for Facebook to gather information about you and your friends?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   Oh, very much so.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.920]   The point is that you have a little like button everywhere
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.280]   on the web.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.440]   If you click that, then it posts a Kevin-like twig thing
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.280]   to your Facebook feed.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.160]   The other thing they said was rather than--
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.400]   they're also changing the way the profiles work.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   So before the assumption was that you would fill in your profile
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.560]   once and you would say what your favorite movies were
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.040]   and your favorite records and all that stuff records.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.200]   Records, what are those?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.680]   Your favorite music.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   A favorite music.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.040]   Music bumbles.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.120]   Do you remember records?
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.800]   I still have some of the garage.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.680]   So you can-- before you used to have
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.360]   to type this in as part of your profile creation
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   and then they got stale and sat there forever.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.760]   So the idea now is that these lights
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.720]   will be a dynamic part of your profile.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.840]   So when I like twig, twig will show up in my Facebook profile
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.960]   by clicking on the twig page.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.200]   So that's actually quite a nice, you know, clever idea.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.360]   But I'll have the--
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.960]   that's an explicit action.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.240]   It's not going to be just doing it just because I go to--
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.160]   you know, Sally's--
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.720]   You'll have to push the button, right?
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.400]   You'll have to push the button, but they will know
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.560]   that you've visited that page.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.720]   That's what's creepy.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.600]   That's what's creepy as well.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   It is creepy.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.760]   Because they've got a API frame.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.280]   And so, you know, that was the thing we did differently
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   with Frank and Nick was you had to log in before we
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.880]   captioning data about you.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.160]   Whereas if you're previously logged into Facebook,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.480]   you are logged into that iframe.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.400]   So just by visiting the page, Facebook will
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   know you've been there and it'll show you information
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.280]   about that page.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.200]   Hold on, hold on, let me make sure I got this straight.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.440]   So if any site on the web puts up that iframe,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.040]   then Facebook will know that I visited that site so long
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.120]   as I'm logged into Facebook.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   Yeah, if you haven't logged out of your Facebook--
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.240]   I mean, it's the same--
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.680]   I think it's the thing--
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.200]   Google crap about privacy.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.760]   Yeah, really.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.600]   It's the same kind of thing that-- well,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.080]   it's the same kind of thing that the ad servers do, right?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.560]   The ad servers have a cookie on you, and they serve a page--
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   But they never publish that information.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.760]   Right?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   There's a chance that Facebook will publish that information.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.400]   And if I don't send my defaults right and want to--
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   That's a good point.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440]   That's a great thing.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.040]   They've been saying that setting privacy defaults
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.280]   is the new programming your VCR.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.200]   Right.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.680]   It's a point that you make, Kevin, that it's too complex.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.440]   Thus we don't do it.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   Thus the default matters.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.960]   When they change this default, just
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.600]   as the proof of concept on Twitter,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.400]   I called my mom who's on Facebook,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   and I asked her if she knew about the privacy settings,
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.000]   and it confused her.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.080]   She had no idea what we were talking about,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.520]   nor the fact that because she never
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.680]   set privacy settings, her privacy
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.480]   had now at this point defaulted to none, to public, basically.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   Right.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.320]   I wonder what percentage of Facebook users never
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.280]   set privacy defaults.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.120]   The chain--
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.840]   They're doing a little dance here about what's public
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.600]   and what's private.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.120]   So what they have is they will give you--
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.480]   they're trying to make more stuff public so it can be shared.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.360]   They're trying to do that.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   But at the same time, this data that they have,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.560]   you can only really get access to this so-called open graph
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.280]   API if you actually authenticate against it as a developer
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.960]   so they can shut off your access again.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.920]   So there's a--
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.000]   there's a sort of back and forth.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.320]   Basically, they're getting this set of data,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   but I think they're designing in such a way
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.640]   that, say, Google can't index it.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520]   So the likes page is adjacent structure.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.680]   You have to have all to see that see my likes.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.520]   You can see the graph.facebook.com/kevinmarks.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.080]   Metadata about me, but that's just the minimal metadata.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.800]   If you actually want to get richer stuff,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.280]   then you have to authenticate against it,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.440]   which is mostly a good thing.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.200]   Some site also learns data about me?
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.840]   Can it share it?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.240]   You have to log in to do that.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.520]   So just as you understand--
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.040]   I understand that.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.080]   But if I go to Kevin Marks' Bazaar, you're using all this,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.880]   I'm logged in.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.040]   Do you get data about who visits your site?
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.680]   I don't get that directly.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.280]   If you're correctly, right?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.360]   I don't get that directly.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.440]   I have to--
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.080]   Create an app.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.360]   --get to log in, as you would do now with Connect.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.040]   So Facebook gets to--
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.320]   Should you get personally an identifiable information
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.800]   about your readers?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.320]   Yes, you can.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.920]   So long as those conditions are set.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.600]   Yes, if they log in, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.320]   In the same way that you can now with Facebook Connect.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.240]   And that's not an explicit action per site, for me,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.600]   the reader.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.080]   You know you have to make a specific action
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.040]   to give it to that site.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.480]   I do.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.880]   All right.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.440]   So there is an isolation.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   So there's the iframe that has the Facebook stuff in,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.120]   and there's the outer site.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.840]   And to jump back across that boundary,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.920]   you have to give permission.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.400]   So again--
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.760]   Again, you were saying--
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.400]   It's very similar to the way Frank Connect works.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.480]   So that was the thing that when we designed Frank Connect,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.120]   there was a separation between the two
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.560]   so that the site wouldn't get stuff
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   unless you made an action there.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   But in this case, it is rooting after Facebook service.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.760]   My concern is that this stuff is so complicated
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.200]   and difficult to understand what data is going, where,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.440]   and who's getting what about me.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.600]   I mean, if I can't understand this,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.560]   or I have to make an extreme effort to understand this,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.680]   no normal person is going to understand this.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.960]   It seems to me Facebook is moving a little faster
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.520]   than the public you keep up with.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   I think it people--
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.840]   what you'll see is you go to the page
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.880]   and you'll see Gina and Jeff like this page.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.360]   And you'll see their faces by it.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.760]   And you go, oh, OK, that's interesting.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.000]   And then you can like it too.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.960]   No, I understand the public-facing stuff.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.120]   What I'm worried about is--
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   That's what's actually going on behind the scenes.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.760]   It's all of that stuff going.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.920]   There's a conversation going on between sites
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.280]   I visit in Facebook now.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.040]   And I don't really know what's going on.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.000]   Right.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   Yeah, some of them are a lot more comfortable
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.200]   with an ad company associating my IP address
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.760]   across two sites that I visited through cookies.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.080]   Right, because Facebook knows so much more about you now.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.240]   Facebook has so much more information about me personally
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.600]   and how I interact with my friends and my name.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.960]   Ad companies don't have that, even though they--
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.360]   Right, you know what they're after Gina, right?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.920]   They're after--
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.400]   Right, they--
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   Targeting an ad, then they're kind of done.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.280]   Right.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.840]   So Kevin, you're saying-- so if I wanted to--
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.680]   So say I integrate this on my site.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.720]   In order for me to get the information about the visitors
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.000]   to my site, I will have had to create an app that
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.200]   authenticates and that the user would have to also grant
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.280]   access to in order for me to get that information as the site
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.800]   publisher, as the external site publisher.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   No.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   Is that what you meant?
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.160]   Yes.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.040]   Oh, we would.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.920]   You would have to get them to--
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.760]   you can get the likes to hit the like button,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.600]   then you could go and get that feedback from Facebook,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.120]   because you can query against your domain.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.840]   Yeah, I'm not so worried about the publisher.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.400]   Like, OK, you go to twit.tv, you press like.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.960]   If you've logged into twit.tv, then I can get some information.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.400]   Yes.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.960]   But I'm much more concerned about the fact
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.640]   that the more people put-- every site I go visit now
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.200]   that has a like button, if I haven't logged out of my Facebook
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.000]   account, Facebook is aggregating information about me.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.600]   About my travels.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.280]   Yes, that's right.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.240]   Huge amount of information about my travels.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.800]   And I don't really have-- I'm not even opting into that,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.960]   particularly, because I forgot that I logged into Facebook
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   and didn't log-- I mean, I think maybe the lesson here
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.400]   is you should log out of Facebook every time, right?
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.680]   I was going to say, when's there going to be an app that Sandbox
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.080]   is the tab that you're logged in with the Facebook
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.880]   in and keeps other sites from seeing it?
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.000]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.960]   Legal reasons, too, Judy.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.800]   You're right.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.040]   It's a discoverable thing, right?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.760]   How long is Facebook going to hold on to this?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.920]   What do they know versus the ISP?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.400]   I could be using a library machine somewhere,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.480]   but now my identity can be set and tied to me.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.840]   Mr. Publicness, and I'm fine with that.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.400]   But yeah, I think you're right, Leo.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.000]   This is potentially way too complicated
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.880]   to understand the implications.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.320]   This open graph that Facebook's talking about really
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.360]   is more like your life is an open book to Facebook.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.840]   Yes.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.120]   I'm slightly grumpy about the calling it open graph.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.920]   I think that's slightly abusing the term open.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.000]   But we go back and forth in these debates at the time,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.800]   because basically it's a graph that a set of data
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.440]   that is stored on Facebook's servers
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.840]   that third parties have access to that you can update.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   So it's not open in the sense of distributed.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.720]   It's centralized and available from Facebook.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.360]   It's open in the sense of your underwear drawer.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   Yeah, I think this is really interesting.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.840]   I think-- and by the way, I have to say I'm a little bit
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   colored because I've talked to people
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.560]   who think that Mark Zuckerberg is the devil incarnate.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   And then there's people who think Mark is just a nice young guy
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.920]   who's trying to figure it out like we all are.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.840]   But I keep seeing Facebook make moves
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.560]   that it's kind of like Apple where you can interpret it
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.440]   from their point of view as positive for their business.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040]   And you could put it for the user's point of view
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   as good for you.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.360]   You put a like button on your website
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   and you know what people like.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.520]   And I'm building a-- he put up a social graph that says,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.760]   I am friends with Chris Cox.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.600]   I live in Palo Alto.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.760]   I eat a lot of fried chicken.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.160]   What could be wrong with that?
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.120]   But there's this dark side to it that nobody--
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.640]   Facebook doesn't seem to acknowledge.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.960]   But I don't know.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.240]   I think they're very aware of.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.760]   I think in a way it feels like they're
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.360]   doing something a little covert here.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.840]   Well, I'm not sure.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.440]   It's slightly covert in that--
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.120]   so somebody is kind of-- it's being like Beacon.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.240]   Beacon was like the first iteration
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.440]   that was purely focused on commercial.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.640]   Now, this is trying to do that again,
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.200]   but actually provide some value to you.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.800]   So the value to you is the kind of thing
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.440]   that Jeff and I have talked about before,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.280]   of when you're browsing the newspapers,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.720]   seeing your friends' faces on the stories they've read.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.280]   That's actually quite helpful and useful.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.120]   And getting people to sign in to do that
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.280]   was a bit of effort to do.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.560]   Getting them to choose which of six sign-ins to use
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.600]   was even more.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   Right.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   Now we've got Facebook Connect.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   Just use that.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.960]   So the other half of this is--
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.520]   it's a pushback against the anyway stuff
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.840]   that Twitter was launching last week.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.440]   Right.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.960]   To say, OK, we're the one true source of knowledge
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.760]   on the internet.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.840]   Twitter isn't.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.240]   And you don't even need to click a button
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.120]   to log in with us.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.560]   We've already got you logged in.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.680]   Look, here's the information.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.240]   My concern is that this is something
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.760]   that even a web adept finds complex and difficult
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.200]   to understand.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.240]   And a normal person is not going to understand at all
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.200]   what's going on.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.280]   And Facebook, I think, is playing on the fact
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.880]   that this is kind of difficult.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.240]   So you can easily sell it as-- well, it just
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.680]   means you don't have to log into a site.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.840]   You've got a friend, Facebook Connect.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   It's easy.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   You've got the like button.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.800]   It's easy.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.560]   What could be happening?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.680]   Making it easy to you.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.040]   They're busy in the background, collecting data,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.920]   because no one understands how to opt out or opt in
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.480]   or what's going on in the background.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.520]   I mean, it does seem like they're
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.000]   doing a lot in the background without--
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.360]   because it's easier.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.040]   Well, there's bugs where they're using all these nice open web
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.520]   APIs for seemingly malign data gathering techniques.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.400]   What is the benefit to the consumer or to the user?
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.120]   What's the sell on that?
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.760]   And why this is good for me?
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.200]   So what's good for you is that when you browse the web,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   you can see the stuff your friends like.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.880]   You can see their comments on it from the activity streams.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.800]   You can get recommendations of other stuff
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.240]   to look at based on that.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.520]   So they're doing the sort of graph analysis stuff
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.480]   that lots of people are doing.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.560]   So they're bringing that out to the rest of the web.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.240]   So that's a valuable thing.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.560]   I did the friend connect demos of that last year,
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.840]   and we were playing with that stuff.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.440]   And if you can get people to log into it,
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.640]   that works quite nicely.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.000]   If you have a site that has a lot of separate pages,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.360]   a newspaper site is a great example,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.440]   knowing which stories your friends read is really useful,
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.720]   which ones they recommend and correlate them by that.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.240]   So they're doing that stuff and doing that fairly nicely.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.040]   But the challenge is they're doing it in a way that
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.840]   assumes that you want to be logged into it.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.880]   But then Brett Taylor comes up on stage and says something that sent a chill,
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.240]   a little bit of a chill down my spine.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.320]   He said, "A user should be able to show up
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.040]   and never having visited the site before
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.080]   have the site personalized for them based on their social preferences."
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.920]   Yes.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.400]   Holy grail.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.600]   Now, some users are going to go, "Hey, that's great.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.920]   The New York Times knows that I'm interested in stories about this, this, and this,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.480]   and I never been here before. Isn't that wonderful?"
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.960]   But in my mind, I start to think about, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   What's the process that made that possible?"
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.760]   What do you go to the New York Times?
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.120]   I mean, so you go to the New York Times, first of all,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.080]   I think there's a lot of value.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.160]   You go to a web page and seeing your friends' faces on it and names.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.440]   They've been here and they liked it.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   I agree with Kevin.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.480]   There's a lot of value in that.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.680]   So I go to the New York Times and I can see all the articles
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.880]   that my friends have posted to their Facebook walls in the past.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.800]   I have a friend of mine who always, he's like,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.840]   "He's my New York Times editor.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.080]   He picks out all the good articles that I would care about.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.160]   And I see them on his wall."
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.960]   So I would see them on New York Times.com.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.320]   There's a lot of value to that, but it's also a little freaky as well.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.720]   I mean, I think people will see that and be like, "Oh, hmm."
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.200]   There's also social pressure to use this.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.920]   So as a site, as a content creator,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.680]   there's a huge amount of pressure on me to put a like button on everything.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.040]   To co-op, I've been co-opted by this.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   To put Facebook's like button on New York Times.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   There's times people which no one uses,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.760]   but they try to build this on the Times site.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.160]   So this makes, I mean, the fight here is not only who owns the identity,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.120]   right, who has the identity online,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.760]   and then also now who has this relationship machine.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.120]   And media companies and retailers and so on hate somebody
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.760]   disintermediating the relationship, but that's exactly what Facebook is doing.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.560]   Under the guise of saying, "No, no, no, no, no, we're improving the relationship here."
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.720]   But Facebook owns that data.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.320]   I don't know why, but it doesn't bother me when Google does it, for some reason.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.800]   Well, I mean, look at buzz.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.720]   I mean, buzz used relationships across several networks to kind of...
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.560]   Look at the heat.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.520]   But look at the heat they got because it was very easy for people to see,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.360]   "Oh, you're exposing my contact list."
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.520]   I mean, that was very easy for people to see.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.080]   What Facebook's doing is much deeper, much more profound,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.440]   and potentially much more risky for privacy.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.000]   And yet it's so obscure.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.400]   You know, Google's mistake was having that page pop up saying,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.560]   "Here's your friends."
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.520]   Facebook's not going to do that.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.000]   They're going to keep their cards closed.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.120]   Well, there was something about that on Facebook.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.400]   I mean, they did improve the permissions stuff this time around.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.840]   So at the moment when you sign in, you have to sign in,
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.600]   Facebook connects, you have to go through a whole bunch of permissions dialogues.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.120]   Okay.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.200]   And you can apply that and make that clearer.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.160]   They've cleaned up the API so that this new API is the same thing you use,
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.400]   whether you're developing an app on their site or you're developing it remotely.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.240]   So they don't...
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.880]   The actual...
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.280]   Look at the API cleanup they're done is rather nice.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.920]   And the permissions are more granular now.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.680]   So when you sign into the site, we sign with an app,
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.800]   it will say, "I want to see your photographs and this and this and this."
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.880]   It doesn't just give you a whole bunch of them by default.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.840]   So that's...
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   In theory, that should be better.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.200]   I haven't actually explored that yet, but that sounds like an improvement
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.360]   over what you have to at the moment.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.200]   So there's...
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.000]   They seem to be thinking some of this stuff through quite nicely,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.720]   but the other bits are sort of annoying me a bit.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.080]   The other thing that they've done is they've done...
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.840]   The bit that I was getting grumpy about was the way they want you to mark up their page.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.520]   They say, "You can add metadata to your web page
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.560]   and then we can make sense of your page and put it into Facebook."
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.840]   But it's their own namespace in meta tags in the head.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.280]   It's not using micro-formants for H-card or
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.240]   rel-friend links or anything that already exists.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.040]   They basically made up their own thing and said,
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.520]   "Put this extra stuff there as well."
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.440]   So they're trying to get you to explicitly remark up your web
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.960]   in their language so that they can make sense of it
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.400]   and not reuse the stuff that everyone else is using.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   So...
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   That sucks.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   That...
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.800]   You know, other people will be able to parse that markup too.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.200]   But the other thing that Zuckerberg kept saying,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.640]   which was really, you know, why my tweets were really grumpy about it,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.320]   was he was saying, "The web is linked together,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.200]   but what we need is social connections between people on the web."
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.600]   And that's what we want to add to the web.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.520]   The web doesn't have this.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.760]   It was like, "Okay, I know you are selling this,
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.000]   but Jesus Christ hasn't been paying attention."
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.800]   That is the web.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.400]   The link's...
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.360]   Wouldn't it be great if you could link things together?
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.440]   It's like, "Well, we can link together."
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.240]   They're called links.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.240]   It's called links.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   It's been in web for years.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.680]   It's actually what the web is.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.640]   The web is made of links.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.040]   The web is made of links to exist on their service.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   That's the key!
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   That's the key!
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   The web is...
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   To me, this is...
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Yes.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   This is...
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   This is to me what seems to be happening.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   And, you know, it's scary because Facebook has so much 400 million users,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.920]   has so much power, 400 million of them,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.640]   many of whom are not sophisticated in the least.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.040]   It seems to be a huge power grab.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.440]   Now, it's interesting because it may stimulate kind of a backlash.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   Rick Boucher, who's a Democrat from Virginia,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.040]   is talking about legislation.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.240]   He has been for a while in Congress that would allow...
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.440]   Basically, would require opt-in for the privacy rules for...
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.640]   And Google, by the way, says, "That's a terrible idea."
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.240]   But we also have privacy czars in a half dozen countries,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   Canada and various in Europe, that sent this letter to Google yesterday.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   Right.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.640]   That's, I think, fairly scary because my talk in Germany that I'll be putting up later tonight,
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   the German paradox about privacy and publicness and penises,
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.040]   is arguing that when they go after things like Street View in public,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   they're robbing from the public.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   We talked about that on Sunday, but I don't buy that so much.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.840]   Well, but now you have these people saying that
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.640]   we're going to try to restrict you, Google, from taking pictures of public,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   but nobody else.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   And they even complained about Google putting out a beta.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   Oh, please.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.640]   And basically saying, "No, no, no, no, because this assumption from the old world is,
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   "No, no, no, you should put out this product absolutely fully baked, fully thought out, perfect."
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.440]   Or else, because it's not a car they're putting out, it's just chat.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   We're going to talk more about this and all the other subjects,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.240]   but right now I want to mention a word from our sponsor, as they say.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   Go to Meeting is an online meeting service that is just the best effect.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.040]   I just did a Go to Meeting.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.240]   I was so cool on my iPad.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   They have a free little app, so I was going to get shown some software.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   So the folks said, "Okay, go to Go to Meeting, they gave me ID."
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   I didn't even know this.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   They can hear me because I have a speaker on my iPad and I can hear a mic and a speaker.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   I didn't even need to use the phone for this meeting.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   I just needed the answer.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   I could sit out in the bench with a Wi-Fi and have a meeting.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   It is amazing.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.120]   Go to Meeting means you don't have to travel as much.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.600]   You could get the job done without going across town or out of the country.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   If you've not tried Go to Meeting, I want you to try it free right now.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.840]   You probably have tried other meeting software and I don't want you to get scared away because
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.440]   that other stuff is not as easy to use, not as easy to configure.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   Go to Meeting is very simple.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com/twig, go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.720]   Just sign up for 30 days free, no cost or obligation.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.240]   See how you'll have it installed within a second.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.440]   It takes about 20 seconds to download and you're done.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   No firewall, port forwarding or DMZing or configuring.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.040]   You don't have to call the IT, but it just works.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.800]   You will cut costs by eliminating travel.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.960]   You'll improve communications with the people you work with.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   You'll work smarter.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   You'll work more efficiently.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.720]   For product reviews, sales present, that's what we were doing, by the way.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.080]   For sales presentations, by the way, we use it all the time for that.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.040]   Meeting sessions, collaboration, just taking a conference call and making it more engaging.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   Go to meeting.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   It's the best.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.680]   Go to go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.840]   This week in Google, TWIG, and try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.720]   We thank the folks at Citrix for making this show possible.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.280]   We appreciate it.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.800]   So Boucher says consumers should be able to opt out of first party use of the information
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.200]   and for its use by third parties or subsidiaries.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.040]   Consumers should be able to opt in to use the information by third parties for those
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.640]   parties' own marketing purposes.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.400]   They should have the choice.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.000]   Google says there's a position paper that just came out.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.160]   They call this opt-in dystopia.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.040]   Environments in which cumbersome opt-in requirements could discourage users from engaging socially
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.600]   on useful sites, could push service providers to over-collect user data at the point of
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.720]   consent, and could turn the net into "landscapes of walled gardens in which consumers are reluctant
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.960]   and even afraid to explore new services."
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   Amen.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.720]   It puts some snooze holes in the next few years.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   Here's the quote.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.360]   This is from the Google position paper.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.040]   "The opinion is a rhetorical straw man that cannot really be implemented by regulatory
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:25.560]   policies without creating a number of unintended side effects, many of which are sub-optimal
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   for individual privacy."
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   Is that true?
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   Yeah, it's the web.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.320]   So the issue is, I can see what they're getting there at there, which is you don't have one
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.640]   after filling a form when every damn site you go to.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   That's kind of where we are at the moment.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.040]   No, but Facebook will fix that.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   True.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:51.560]   But that's what I've been trying to do with a bunch of other people is to try to do this
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.960]   in a way that doesn't involve having it in one place, but having it in a place of your
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   choosing.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   Yes.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.680]   Not one giant database that is then subject to...
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   That's a good idea.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.720]   So I create a set of privacy policies that are my personal privacy policies.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   You could host your...
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.320]   You could host your personal information on your own side.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.840]   It could be an open ID kind of a thing.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   Here it is.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   That's the idea of web finger.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.160]   Web finger is, here's my address.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.680]   You look the address up and then it can derive the rest of this stuff from that.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.080]   I've been asking about web finger.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   I love that idea.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   I remember the old finger protocol.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   It was such a great idea.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.800]   We used to use it all the time.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.200]   Well, so we got this...
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   We got open ID.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   So open ID proves I own a URL.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Right?
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   Right?
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.800]   And that's basically all open ID does.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.400]   But what that means is once I've got a URL, I can go to that URL and fetch the web page
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.320]   there and look for links from that and look at it for information.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.800]   So you can get information and endpoints and so on.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   I can have an XFN.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.120]   You can have an XFN link.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.880]   You can have an H card.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.800]   You can have links to API endpoints to get more data.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.480]   So once you've got a URL, that's a powerful thing.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.360]   What you have with...
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.280]   The problem you have is with login is that people don't tend to use URLs to login.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:13.260]   So the web finger idea is you use an email address and then we have a set of rules to
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.240]   get from an email address to a URL where you can get that information.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.840]   So it's a way of locking in with an email address and it will then do the open ID or
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.440]   OAuth or whatever it is from that.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.000]   So that's the goal of it.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.720]   That's the way to do it.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.880]   But the point is it is truly distributed.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:36.720]   So if I have Kevin at KevinMarkz.com, that will then know to go to KevinMarkz.com to
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.040]   look it up or I could have used KevinMarkz at gmail.com and then it will go to gmail to
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   look it up.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.360]   But I'm choosing where it's going.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.880]   It's not rooting through one central center.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.680]   Is that possible to implement in a way that's friendly so that my mom...
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.520]   I hate to use that my mom meme, but I've got to.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   Could do it?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   That was the...
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.640]   Well, it was Blaine's grandmother was the original use case because Blaine's grandmother
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.360]   knew his email address but couldn't remember any of his URLs.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.880]   She said she wants to look for Blaine.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   She wants to type in...
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   Blaine@gmail.com.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   Blaine@gmail.com.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   Blaine@gmail.com.com.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.360]   Blaine@gmail.com.com.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.040]   And look it up from that.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.800]   She wanted to type her own email address in and look it up from that and have the two connected.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.960]   You can't necessarily remember URLs for other people.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.240]   So that was Blaine's worldview is that email addresses are identifying as people that have
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.200]   actually learned to remember.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   Let's go from those.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   That's perfectly...
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   I mean, it works.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.960]   It's got the namespaces all work.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.040]   We don't need to invent a new namespace.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.720]   The problem is it can't be commercialized.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.960]   So Facebook and Twitter and Google don't really like that so much.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.480]   I mean, I'll leave Google out of that because I think Google has mixed motives.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.120]   But clearly Facebook and Twitter are very clear motives.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   Right.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   Google...
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.000]   You're sure Google's got mixed motives but they tend to move in the...
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.160]   I don't work them anymore.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.000]   They do tend to move in the direction of doing this in an open standards way.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I think you're honest about it.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.240]   I think you're filling profiles on their side and getting more information about you and
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   target ads.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   That's part of the nature.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.760]   It doesn't matter as much to them though as it does to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:15.920]   The way it matters to them is that they want signals to personalize your experience of Google
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.040]   more and your relevance for Google.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   And so having a tie into that is business benefit to them, which is different, I think,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   from Facebook.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   How?
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.160]   I wouldn't Facebook benefit from having some sort of connection to say Twitter.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   I mean, if you could...
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.440]   So on your Google profile, you say, "Here's my Facebook page.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   Here's my Twitter page.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.280]   Here's all my other URLs."
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.600]   But Facebook doesn't say what's your Twitter username.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.680]   You can't really imagine them doing that.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.800]   But it would be beneficial to them, wouldn't it, for them to know their social health on
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   another network?
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.160]   I connect my Facebook to Twitter.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.240]   I can't remember how I do that.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   But I...
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.800]   You feed your status updates into Facebook, right?
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.640]   But connecting to Twitter and saying, "Here's my Twitter username.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.800]   You can get my social...
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.240]   Can you imagine Facebook recommending a friend that you don't follow on Facebook but that
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.480]   you do follow on Twitter to you?"
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   Sure.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   It should.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   It's a little bit...
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.280]   Their goal is to collect it all, right?
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.960]   I mean, right now I authorize...
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.520]   I authorize Facebook to access my Twitter account, right?
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   Is that not how it's working?
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   Or is it the way around?
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.520]   Yeah, I think it's a Facebook app, right?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   It's the way around.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   That's the way around.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.520]   That's the way around.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.520]   It's the way around.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.520]   It's in your feed.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.640]   The thing that Facebook doesn't want you to do is point a link in somewhere else and say
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   that's me.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   Right.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   They let you like pages.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   Live on Facebook.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   But they don't want you to point out.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.040]   Where is the world but live here?
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.880]   The Google profile and the Twitter profile and friend feed a lot of these others say,
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.240]   "Okay, here's your thing on this side and the here point is just to you elsewhere."
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   Right.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   That's part of our goal.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   And that's a piece that's...
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   That's the difference.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.880]   Well, Facebook's AOL.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.320]   It's just the AOL for the 21st century.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.600]   It's a walled garden that's going to let you leave the garden, visit around as long as
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.320]   everything you do is pumped back inside the walls.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.080]   There's a great moment on Twitter the other day that Steve Case saw someone say that,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.560]   "Oh, Facebook's is just like the AOL of walled garden."
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.440]   And Steve Case said, "It reminds me of the old days."
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.040]   The good old days.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.800]   All right.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.240]   What about docs.com?
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   That was interesting.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   I had a quick look at that.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   That was interesting.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.040]   What's the story there?
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.840]   So, actually, Kevin was listening.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.360]   So, he probably has the details, but it looks like Microsoft launched a partnership with
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:31.760]   Facebook, docs.com, where you can share office documents with your Facebook friends online.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   They're...
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   Whoa.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   That's like a...
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   Well, it's Google Docs.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   That's my kind of saying, "You know what?
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   Google, you're not going to take over our Docs business.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   We're going to be more...
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.040]   And see, this is what's going to happen because Facebook is again so much power now
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.560]   can go to Google's natural enemies, its hereditary enemies, and say, "Play with us."
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   Doesn't that mix?
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   Isn't that...
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:00.160]   Isn't that a weird kind of mixed like buzz and Gmail in the sense that it mixes potentially
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.240]   your personal and your professional lives in ways that people aren't going to like?
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   And identities.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.840]   Maybe, but then again, I mean, on Facebook, maybe my network on Facebook is Gocker Media,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   which is my publisher.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   You know, I can't imagine this share.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   That's fine.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   That's true.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.880]   But how many people you know, Gina, who just don't want their business people to be part
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   of their Facebook?
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   Oh, lots of people.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   Lots of smart people.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   Really?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.880]   Smart people.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   Definitely.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.400]   Who have, you know, just button up jobs and, you know, want to post their Facebook about
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   personal stuff.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   I don't know.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   I'm allowing, let's see, Docs to access my public information and send me an email.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   Why not?
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   How convenient is that?
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.440]   You're so cynical today.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.600]   Well, I just signed up.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   I'm not that cynical.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   I just signed up.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.800]   I can now see my friends, Docs, so they're not sharing it with me.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   You know what?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.240]   This is very interesting.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   Holy cow.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.680]   I just put a link into one from Lily Cheng, who's, you know, Lily Cheng at Microsoft.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   Yes.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   And runs two slats.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   This is one of her projects.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.280]   So what was it?
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.880]   docs.com/43capitalg is her intro document to that that shared in there.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.560]   Yeah, actually it's when you sign into Docs as well.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.120]   It's the first thing.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   Some docs you might find interesting.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.920]   Yeah, this exploration exposes you to look at the side of Ray Ozzie's broad.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.600]   Here's Ray Ozzie's got a PowerPoint.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.040]   He's broad and long held vision of social productivity.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   I like social productivity.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.640]   That's how to be the most dull friend in the world, sharing power points with your
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   friends.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   You can imagine that as a Microsoft.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   It's something friendly and useful.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   Come on, that's nice.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.280]   Not only that, I have to update Silverlight.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   Damn it.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   I just did that.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   I'm just going to take the second slide.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   I'm just going to do that.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   How much?
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   I'll take the second slide.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   No, I think this is really a shot across the bat.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.040]   I just think you approve of dialogue.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.760]   It doesn't let me uncheck things.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.720]   You didn't want to uncheck those.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.560]   It's like you didn't want to revoke the dialogue.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.760]   You could get my email address and stuff.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.160]   I don't want you to post stuff to my wall.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   Can I turn that one off, please?
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   No.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   Let me do that.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   No.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   It's an all-around-nothing doc.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   It is a fail.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   This is the Wednesday, Leo.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   You never saw this before, Gina.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.520]   I was going to say, the Saturday video is usually much more relaxed.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   I'm exhausted by then.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.840]   I still have some spunk left in me.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.720]   I still have a fire in the belly.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.040]   No, I've actually been a little worried about this.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   I don't know why.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.160]   I'm willing to be talked down on this, but much more worried about what Facebook's intentions
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.600]   are than what Google's intentions are.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.480]   I think it's not at all surprising to see that this confirms my suspicions with Microsoft
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.760]   doing a deal with Facebook.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.360]   You're going to see all of it.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   It's just a matter of time before Apple does a deal with Facebook.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   Maybe they're the third leg of this one.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   I think you're right.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   The third leg.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.200]   No, I was going to say, I mean, it feels like Facebook doesn't really even try not to
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   be evil.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   Right.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   They don't care.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.000]   They, you know, their attitude is, go ahead.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Are we evil?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Figure it out.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Right.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   What do you...
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.640]   I think you're right.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   Evil?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   Come on in and check us out.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   I don't know.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   We could be.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.920]   I had a different theory at one time where when the news feed started and everybody went
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.120]   ballistic, the truth is that Zuckerberg was right.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   The news feed had value.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.840]   He just announced it wrong.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.000]   Then came the ad program.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.160]   And it did make sense, but he announced it wrong and had to kill it.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   Right.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.720]   And he just put stuff out there.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.840]   It's just a, you know, he's just a young guy who's got great ideas and he throws stuff
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   up against the wall.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.400]   Let's see what sticks.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.920]   Let's see what we can fool you with.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.480]   I'm starting to think, you know, let's see how we...
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.280]   If we can sneak this one by you.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.120]   And now it's gotten so convoluted that only somebody like Kevin Marks, who's an expert
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.960]   in web APIs, even can begin to understand what's going on.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.120]   The implications of it all.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   Well, that's the point.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   I mean, Zuckerberg was using the word magic in his keyword.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   It's magic.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.520]   He's picked up the jobs thing there of like, and his, his breath tailored to explain how
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   this magic works.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.520]   And it's like, hmm.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.120]   It's, you don't need to know.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   Well, that's the point.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.040]   I mean, it's, well, most people, it is magical thinking.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.960]   It's like suddenly magically my friends are here at the New York Times reading the paper
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   with me.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.160]   It's very tempting as a con, and this is what really worries me.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.960]   I could see as a content creator, it's extraordinarily tempting.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.280]   We even, you know, I looked at, for instance, what ABC and Facebook did with the elections
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   page.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.360]   And that was not a Facebook page.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:26.680]   It was an ABC page that merged your friends, chat about the elections and stuff in together.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.560]   And it's very tempting.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.760]   It's very tempting, especially with 400 million people on Facebook.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   Basically, everybody's on Facebook.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   Why wouldn't I play?
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   So it's going to be very few people who are going to be willing to say, wait a minute.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.800]   Yeah, this is this is this is this shirt chocolate covered thing looks good, but do do we really
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   want to eat it?
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.760]   Well, here's the other thing, Leo, if you're a publisher, you're trying to figure out how
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.960]   to get a direct relationship with the readers and only the New York Times, the Wall Street
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.120]   Journal and the FT require registration at all, let alone paying.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.600]   So if you're the stronger tribute, you don't know who anyone is.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.280]   So Mark Zuckerberg now has them by the shorts.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   He's the guy.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   Mark's the man.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.920]   So the only way to have a direct relationship is that.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.480]   So look at the complaints the publishers have had like the New York Times with Kindle.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.920]   The complaint is I had a billion relationship with that reader.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   Now I don't.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   You do Amazon.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   Right.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   Right.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.280]   So now if you want to try to implement, let's say a billion structure across multiple newspapers,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.200]   if Zuckerberg says, you know what, this closed wall I have is really comfy.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   Want to come inside?
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   We'll do that.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   Well, he's in.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   So it's all about wall building, the app world that I keep complaining about you keep
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.400]   it ignoring them because I'm full of crap, but fine.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.280]   I think it's a walled issue.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.840]   And now Facebook is a walling issue.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.360]   It's wall versus open is really and then we have, you know, these privacy bozos and
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.080]   and China and Google putting out, we'll talk about later, you know, the censorship.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.360]   There's a lot of wall building going on.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   Hmm.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.800]   The thing that the other thing that Google published yesterday was the here's the, the
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.240]   account of requests we've had from different governments and blocking things.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   Yeah, I thought that was interesting.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.080]   That was very interesting to see, especially as I was looking at per capita and that meant
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.800]   the UK was way in the lead, which obviously makes me nervous given that laws they just
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   passed there.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.560]   So that's a, yeah, that, I think that's for them, that's a very effective counter to
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.680]   the, to the privacy stuff from the, from the, the governments to say, okay, here's all this
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.280]   stuff that you were trying to do because there's this, there's this weird asymmetry
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   in privacy.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   So that's a very, very effective way to say that.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   So I think that's a very effective way to say that.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.960]   If I can see you, you can see me, that Google is, you know, trying to say, okay, we found
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.880]   this thing in public, we're going to make it public for you too.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   And then, you know, in this Facebook movie is a bit like that as well.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.320]   They said, okay, we've gathered this graph data.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.280]   You can now read the graph data, which is a, which is a good move in that direction.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:14.840]   But the, you know, what, what we're seeing from the, the governments is, you know, how,
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.400]   how dare you gather this information.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.080]   But the same time they're, they're subpoenaing them and saying, give us, give us all the
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   information you've got.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   And the geolocation one is the best example for me.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:29.400]   This is, this is where at the moment the phone company and the police know where you are,
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.080]   but your friends don't.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.800]   And that's the thing that we've just started changing and people are going, oh, no, the
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   people can find out where you are.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.720]   It's like, well, people have already been able to find out where you are and been able
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   to abuse that.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.360]   The difference is that now you can find out where you are and you can decide who to share
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   that with.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.440]   And that's immediately moved back to that conversation rather than the should be banned
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.240]   this conversation.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.800]   We need to take a break and I, there is some other stuff to talk about and we do have to
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.280]   get Jeff out of here in a few minutes.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.880]   So let's, I hate to move on.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.120]   This is such an interesting and I think it's an important conversation.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.000]   I had to say, there are some other things that Facebook can ask for instance, no longer
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.320]   24 hours limit on the, on the caching of Facebook data, which I think is great.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.240]   Because that was a real, that was a bizarre kind of limitation that was imposing.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.040]   And they also added web hooks that'll update you.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.400]   So you can say, tell me when this profile exchange changes and it'll, it'll call you
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   back.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   So that's so awesome.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.840]   So that's, those two go together quite nicely.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.800]   So rather than having to poll them all the time and saying, has this stuff changed, you
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.920]   can register and say, call me when this changes.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.880]   So that's very handy.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.280]   The actual API they've done, Brett has done a lovely job there.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.160]   If you go to the API.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:43.200]   More spun sugar around the little jiggle, little gingerbread around the house.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Come on in kids.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   The oven's warm.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   The oven's warm.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.720]   I'm telling you, I'm very nervous about all of this.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   And it's a juggernaut.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.320]   I mean, this thing is, that's what really scares me.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.280]   If Facebook were the size of even Twitter, I wouldn't worry so much.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.840]   But it's massive.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.400]   You're watching this week in Google, a great cast, Kevin Marks, Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.000]   talking about Facebook's FA conference and more.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.720]   But I need to interrupt because I forgot to say something about carbonite.com and I
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.200]   want to get this in here.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:21.720]   It's backed up done right carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.920]   Combines the two things that are most important with backup.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.400]   It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.720]   It just does it.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.160]   And it's offsite.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   I still encourage people to make local backups.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   That's fine.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.120]   It's always good to have multiple copies of everything.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.240]   But what if the worst happens and somebody breaks in and steals a computer and your backup?
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.760]   Or the house burns down, the office burns down.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.400]   Then you've got nothing.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.320]   So you've got to have really two copies.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.800]   I say three copies of everything.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.960]   Your existing internal drive, an external backup drive and carbonite.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.120]   Offsite backup.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.480]   Carbonite is just great for your peace of mind.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.640]   You can look at your carbonite files, see that they're there.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.720]   You can check them with an iPhone application or from any computer you can get online.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.640]   You can restore easily with just a click of the mouse.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.040]   And carbonite is unlimited backup for all those personal documents on your internal drive.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.880]   Everything that's there for one low flat rate, $5, actually less than $5 a month, $55 a year.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.560]   Try it free for 15 days just to get an idea of what carbonite can do for you.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.600]   Of course, you have to have high speed internet to make this work.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.240]   And it will take a little time for that first backup depending on how fast your internet
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.880]   connection is and how much data you have.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.080]   But once it's there, the trickle up backups in the background always going on without
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.720]   slowing down your system.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.480]   So you're always up to date.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Try it right now.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   15 days free.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.000]   All you need is this twig.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.400]   That's the offer code TWIG.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.240]   Sign up for that free trial.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.120]   Use the offer code twig and you have 15 days free.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.560]   And then after the trial, if you decide to buy two months free when you use the offer
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.560]   code TWIG.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.880]   It's in the cloud.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.080]   It's encrypted.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   It's automatic.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   It's backup done right.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.760]   You got to back it up to get it back with carbonite.com.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.080]   Now back to the show.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   No more HTTP.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   I think that's kind of a smart thing.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   I do too.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.560]   I think it's great.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.560]   It's just, it's there.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.080]   You don't need to type it.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.800]   I remember when we started doing years ago, in 1994 when I started doing a TV show called
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:28.640]   the site on MSNBC, they would still in the lower thirds type HTTP/slash.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.320]   And Soledad O'Brien would say every time she said a website, HTTP/slash.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   What I hate is when they say forward slash.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.760]   You use the backward slash only in windows.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.280]   But also it's not a forward slash.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   It's a slash slash.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   It's a slash.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.760]   But the forward slash is the thing using windows power.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.440]   It's not the one that goes that way.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   You're kidding.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   Right?
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.600]   It's a I don't know depends.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   It works.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.840]   So you're saying Kevin that a regular.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.720]   It's a standard slash that that's a backslash.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.680]   Maybe maybe in Britain it is.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.600]   Well, so Stephen Fry said we should just call it say stroke.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   Stroke.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.160]   Much nicer word and it's a single syllabus.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.440]   And then what's really nice is when you want to do the other one, you say backstroke.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.840]   Or as you say, I like that.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.920]   Anyway, it Chrome no longer even shows you HTTP colon slash slash, which was the most
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.480]   confusing thing now that the entire world has memorized that.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.360]   The other thing it does is that I did a I do a lot of site colon searches, you know,
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.200]   to restrict the search one site.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   It now takes that and turns it into a little gray box.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.080]   It says search buzz machine.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.520]   Oh, that's really cool.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   Yeah, it is.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.520]   You know what?
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.320]   You consider it too that by changing our habit by getting rid of the Google search box,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   of course, I'm now in the habit fully.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   I use Chrome all the time.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.200]   I just put searches right into the bar.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   I love it.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.400]   And the beautiful thing is Google now knows even better what I'm searching for where I
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   go.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   See that doesn't bother me.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   I know either.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   I don't know.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   It's going to be better service.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   Let them know.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   Google fan boy.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.600]   Because you remember when who was it?
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.680]   Altivist somebody released all that search data and it took a reporter like two days
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.080]   to figure out who this anonymized search data was from and caller at her home.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.960]   So all they need is, you know, what you search for.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.960]   They know everything.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   The AOL the day.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.960]   Well, it was AOL.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.360]   I was the first of all listeners ever heard of this to Leo.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.360]   I think we're dating.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   I remember the.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.000]   You remember dog piles.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.600]   I love that.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   Altivist.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   Northern lights.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   I thought that was.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Northern lights.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.120]   Who do I know that used to work for them?
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.320]   I maybe Dane used to work for them.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.800]   Hey, good news.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.680]   Android 2.2 is on the road map on the horizon and we may get it first on our Nexus one phones.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   What?
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   What?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   What?
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.080]   Is that how you supposed to say what?
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   What?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   What?
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   What?
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   Can you loop that Leo?
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   Yes.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.720]   You just hit the button whenever something good happens.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   It's my new ringtone.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   Are you kidding?
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.440]   I can't even get that hot.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   What?
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   What?
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.280]   Apparently will also include a flash 10.1.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.880]   You want to woot that?
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   Not really.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   Ain't no.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   Ain't no.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   Ain't no.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   There.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.880]   What else will be in fro yo?
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.560]   You must know some stuff, Gina.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   You're like a developer inside.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.720]   I don't know.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.840]   I don't know what else is going to be in fro yo.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.240]   All I know is it's going to be call fro yo.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   I'm really excited that it's coming down to the Nexus one.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.800]   My latest Android thing is the incredible, which looks quite incredible.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.600]   Don't you want that on Verizon?
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   I just want to talk to you about it.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.760]   It's an HTC and it's kind of what it's kind of what I think.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.520]   It's HTC's response to the Nexus one.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.080]   It's like, well, that was nice Google.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   But what about this?
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.080]   What about this?
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.840]   And we're just going to pick a really good adjective and name it that.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.040]   It's incredible.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.040]   Incredible.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.960]   So the only thing I'm worried about is instead of the ball, which by the way, apparently in
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.880]   new Android 2.2, the rumors are will be multi-colored now.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.840]   Your Nexus one will suddenly do the color thing it was supposed to do.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.480]   Which cyanogen rom does now, right?
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.480]   Right.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:23.280]   And so like you could have a blue for SMS notification and red for a Google talk notification or
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.640]   whatever.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.360]   But there's this optical.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   And some people are saying the optical is not so good as the track ball.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.920]   The track ball, it goes, you know, it's like being behind an old lady on a stair.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.640]   I hate the track ball in the Nexus one.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   With a walker.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   I've got anything against old ladies on stairs.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.840]   With walkers.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.120]   And then eight megapixel camera.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.600]   Will it be front?
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.240]   Will there be a front-facing camera too, Gina?
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   Because that's the iPhone I think.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   That's the Apple.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   The iPhone is going to have a front-facing camera.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   That's the iPhone.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.720]   It's a Nokia N900 with a front-facing camera.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.280]   You can't call anybody because nobody else has that.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.960]   You have to use, you have to use "fring".
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.160]   So maybe with every, when everybody has it on their iPhone it'll...
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.040]   I can use it to be on "Twig".
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   You could.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.040]   You could walk around with that.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.800]   Which they have, they have a carrier for the incredible?
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   Yes, for "isen".
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   Right.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   No, they're definitely.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   No, they're thumbs up, right?
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   It's for "isen".
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   That'll be available soon.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   June, when is I-O?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   June 4th?
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   May.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   May.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   May 4th?
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.440]   Like the 16th I want to say.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:30.200]   That's when we think Froyo come out because of course that's when all the developers who
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.600]   go to I/O get their very own Nexus One or Android for free.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Yeah, we get the Droid, yeah.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.520]   It's May 19th and the 20th.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   That's it.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   Oh, so you think they're going to push down two two then?
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   Of course.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   Right around that makes sense.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.840]   They're not going to give you a Droid with two one on it.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.200]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.000]   Although they're shipping the phones out before the event.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.320]   So they're not getting them out at the event.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.600]   They said they wanted you to get started early on your app.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   When does yours come?
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   It should be in a week or so.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.160]   I'm in New York now, but I'm hoping that went by a time I get back to San Diego this
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.880]   weekend and it'll be in the mailbox.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   I got the confirmation.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.680]   This is going to have to go to a German bar to steal it.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.280]   Hey, what's your journalist?
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.520]   What's your take on this whole-we talked a lot about it on Twitch.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   Thank you, Ted.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   I'll bet you did.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.840]   I'd say it's a new world, it's public.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.120]   There's stuff about whether or not it was stolen versus just left there.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:29.160]   But if it's left there, on the bar store or on the street or whatever, Nick makes clear
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.760]   that he buys New Zealand.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   No pride about that.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.320]   I say welcome to the new world.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.320]   What do you think, Leo?
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.120]   Well, and by the way, Gina, we're going to let you recuse yourself because you still
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.320]   do stuff for Gawker media.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   Yes.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.320]   Okay.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   Or she has the opinion, you should make sense.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   Nick would care, right?
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.840]   I'll tell you my opinion, but I'd like to hear yours.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   Yes.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.120]   Oh, I think it's reprehensible.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.240]   And I think that Nick may be going to jail, to be honest with you, because I think he's
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   broken the law.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.400]   He receives stolen merchandise.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   Was it stolen?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   What made it stolen?
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.720]   There's a California state law.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   No, no, it doesn't matter.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   California state law, if you find an object, you must make a good faith effort to find the
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.480]   owner.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   And the person, first of all, if you believe Gizmo's a photo story, which they clearly
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:18.760]   published to justify what they did, that the guy left it on the bar stool and then the
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.720]   guy picked it up and he asked, "Who's phone is this?"
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:28.240]   And then he placed several calls to Apple's switchboard saying, "I have your phone."
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.520]   But I can't remember his name, but somebody pointed out that he not wants to.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.840]   They asked the bar's owner if the person had called.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.240]   And apparently the Apple employee called multiple times, very agitatively, saying, "Has anybody
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   found a phone?
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   Has anybody found a phone?"
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.680]   So there really wasn't a good faith effort to find the owner.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.920]   I bet that was by the seller, right?
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.120]   By the seller.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:55.560]   But if you purchase, it's the fall off the back of a truck rule.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.360]   Well, okay, so Leo, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.760]   one of your, your, your acolytes comes into the, to the cottage and says, "You won't believe
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.560]   what I found, Leo.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.360]   I found the next iPhone.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   Want to see it?"
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   We'd look at it.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.960]   You would put it on your own show to me that you would show us.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.280]   I would, no, I might even show it, but I wouldn't pay five grand for it.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.840]   Well, I mean, they didn't know what I'm not there getting a Chinese knockoff.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.280]   Denton pays for stories.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.520]   He's, he's really clear about that.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   They've done it.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.520]   He's done it before.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.600]   That's, you know, that's whatever.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.000]   That's choice.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   They held onto the phone.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   They checked it out.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   They tried to figure out whether or not it was.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.720]   Like the worst part is they tore it apart, right?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   Yeah, they broke it.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   They broke it.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   That's the kind of, that's a little beyond it.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.840]   They broke it because as somebody pointed out, they've never shown us a picture of the
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.600]   screen with the connect to iTunes.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.120]   And Apple very cleverly brick did.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.560]   They brick it immediately.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.000]   I feel bad for the poor kid who lost it because he's.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.520]   He did the right thing until obviously telling him right away is, uh oh.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.360]   Well, we don't know if he told him right away.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.720]   He could have brick it himself.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   Oh, really?
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   Sure.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   You could brick it yourself.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   It's a nice feature.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   Mobile me.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   Press the brick button.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:04.200]   Um, they better have a, have a warning.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.720]   Are you sure in front of it?
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.200]   Now a couple of warnings I would hope, I don't know.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.160]   I, I have to say, uh, by the way, and somebody's pointing out and you're right, I, when,
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.560]   uh, Gizmodo first published that story, I said, I, I tweeted that you do not want to
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.160]   be this guy, put the guy's name on, on, on Twitter and I deeply regret it.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.520]   Cause I feel really bad for the guy.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.360]   Any, as somebody's pointed out, any Google search for this guy for the rest of his life
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.840]   is going to, he's going to turn up this story.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   He's not, he's now branded.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.280]   We'll make mistakes and none of us get that kind of publicity when we make those conversations.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.480]   This is a, he was in a bar.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.680]   How many stupid things have you done?
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.880]   Drunken a bar on your birthday.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.880]   Let's be honest.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   Lots of things.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.880]   Yes.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   Absolutely.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.880]   I don't believe.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:50.520]   And now that Facebook knows everything about you, Gina, those pictures will live forever.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.800]   Well, I'll get to have his experience.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.280]   Yeah, that's probably the case.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   I understand.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.560]   I understand why, why folks are upset about it.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.280]   You know, Hey, I grew up as a blogger under Denton.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.160]   I know he buys stories.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.720]   I didn't, I didn't think it was, I'll be very curious.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.600]   I think Apple, I think Apple could sue him at this point.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   I mean, I'm not.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.680]   The discovery is all kinds of fun.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.400]   Yeah, then, yeah, maybe they don't want to.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.400]   This drives and rule, isn't it?
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   I think they don't want to.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.640]   They want this story to go away.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   Right.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.600]   Do you think this job's called Denton directly?
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.240]   No, he got a letter from the effect they publish.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.640]   Oh, there's also this, this report that the jobs called Denton.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.840]   Oh, and Denton's response when asked whether this happened, well, if that happened, it
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.840]   would be confidential.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.320]   Nick would love you to think that Steve.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   Oh, it's exactly.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   First, yeah, I don't think that happened.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   I have no idea.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.320]   I haven't talked to Nick about it.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   I don't think that happened.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.120]   Steve would not humble himself to that degree.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   I doubt.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   Yeah, no, if somebody called it wouldn't be Steve, it'd be.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   Steve wouldn't cool Denton.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.440]   Somebody would have asked someone who's inside the circle.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.080]   Yeah, that's true too, right?
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.880]   He would call somebody he knows.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:56.360]   I mean, because Moto destroyed any of any further future relationship with Apple in terms of
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.360]   covering your products.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.720]   Oh, I've done that.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   Who cares?
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   That's nothing.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:06.600]   But I mean, they were willing to, well, I won't.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.800]   I'm not going to talk about it anymore because yes, I work for Gox.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.960]   I certainly don't want to pull you into this.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.720]   I think it's reprehensible.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.600]   It is checkbook journalism.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.160]   I guess that's the way we are now.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.440]   Jeff, I defer to you.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.520]   You're the- No, no, no, I'm destroying journalism like Nick.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.520]   Oh, it's your fault.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.520]   Oh, it's your fault.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:28.480]   Journalism school saying this, I think someone will come in and beat me up in a moment.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.480]   But-
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.320]   You put it, you put it, opposed to a good hypothetical though.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:37.000]   If somebody walked in here, I have turned down stuff and I've also accepted stuff and
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   not published it.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.440]   Several times I've received what looked to me the be confidential Apple documents and
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.480]   read them and destroyed them, did not show them on the air.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   But I read-
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   Another story this week.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:59.000]   It may sound- I coach, I'm forgetting his name, said controversial things on in a bar.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   And Jerry Jones.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.040]   I don't know Jack about sports because I'm not a real man.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:11.200]   But he was criticizing Bill Parsell as a Tim Tebow and somebody in the bar recorded
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.120]   this and played it and there was just much angst among sports journalists, if that's
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   not an oxymoron, saying, you know, how dare you do this.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.560]   But it was in a public bar, he said it.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.480]   If I told a friend about it in a gossip column, what's the difference between that and me
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.400]   recording it?
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.800]   The difference between Nick buying it and the Nick and Terry and the part and Nick showing
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.720]   it, you know, the damage to Apple in that sense is the same.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.760]   Well, and let's be honest, it ain't the Pentagon Papers and the dang things coming out in
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   two months.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:45.920]   It's not like it's, you know, really what this comes down to is the very vicious news
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.000]   cycle and competition between gadget and gizmodo.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.400]   I mean, that's really- if there's anything to blame for this, it's that.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.280]   And as consumers who will go to whichever gadget blog has the scoop, we're to blame
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.200]   I guess indirectly for it.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.960]   It's our version of, you know, a Paris Hilton story.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.160]   So sad we are.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:13.040]   But the story did better than any other sex tape that I don't know if it's worth publishing.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   They got a ton of-
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.200]   There you go.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   It worked.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   It was well worth five grand.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   There you go.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.200]   I don't know if it's worth publishing.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.360]   Nobody's buying into the, this was leet wa apple nonsense are they?
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.920]   Oh, God, no.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.720]   And you work for Apple, you know better than anyone that that's not so.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.360]   Well, it does not make any sense.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:34.520]   The point about this information coming up can only damage sales of the current iPhone.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.080]   So Apple keeps that close to their chest and anything.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:40.800]   And the other thing is that they make more than one prototype.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.560]   Just because this one has those features in it.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.720]   If it's a prototype, there may be another one out there that has a different set of
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   features in it.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.080]   Apple, Apple will build a bunch of these different ones before they decide which one to manufacture.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   It would be very interesting to see that.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.480]   I didn't know what they didn't just say that.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.080]   Say, oh, yeah, we got 20 of them.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.560]   Ha ha ha ha, you found one.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.680]   They just want this to go away.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.680]   They want people don't want to talk about it.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.800]   Because if it escapes out of our geeky little world who know there's a new iPhone coming
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.480]   to the mainstream and it hurts sales, that costs them real money.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.600]   By the way, Jeff, I loved what you said about stop being an audience and start being participants.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.000]   I thought that was so right on.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.920]   You are the crazy homeless guy who turns out to be right.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.920]   That's a quick reference.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.880]   Somebody tweeted that.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.200]   But I think that's exactly right on and I love that.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.000]   This was a speech that you gave where?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.760]   TEDx, New York, NYED.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.120]   I made fun of the form of TED lectures, thus making fun of the form of education lectures.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.120]   Yes.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.400]   And I'll keep the language clear here, but I started off with some potty mouth.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.520]   Well, you can watch it.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.040]   It's on YouTube.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.800]   The end of the age of content.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.160]   I'll put up another one tonight.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.560]   My German thing, I'll put it up tonight in video.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.560]   Is it German?
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:59:01.360]   No, actually the first two sentences are, but then transfers from bad German to bad English.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.520]   One of which is your native tongue, we won't say which.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.520]   Yes.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.920]   I was saying I'm an American.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.000]   I speak like an American, 1.1 languages.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.640]   Was it Churchill has said Britain and America are two countries separated by a common language?
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   Yes.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.320]   Let's get to our tip.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.280]   We don't have to do a tip number in a tool.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.240]   We've used up our time well enough.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.920]   I'm still on if you want to one, ten more minutes.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   I'm good.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   Okay.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]   We'll do a tip from Magina if you've got one.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   I'm going to find a number now.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.160]   Nobody has anything.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.600]   Okay, never mind.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.360]   I should mention that we were going to do a, well, it's by fault because we were going
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.160]   to do a call-in-only show and then F8 happened.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.600]   I had forgotten about the Facebook conference.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.800]   Kevin Marks very kindly at the very last minute agreed to come on and I thought that this
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.120]   was such a good conversation.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.840]   I did not want to not have this.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.880]   But we will do a, maybe we'll do a call-in show next week, but I would love to do a call-in
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   show.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.400]   Kevin, we spent so much time on, if I may, if I may extend this for just a moment, on
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.280]   the one aspect of Facebook and you were at the beginning of the show went through the
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   other aspect.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:11.080]   Are we missing anything major from implications of Facebook moves?
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.400]   That was the key thing they were pushing was that with these changes.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.680]   The implications for me was, some of it was disappointing in that they seem to, some of
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.080]   it's good and they've gone to OWOR, they've gone to Jason, they've got a bunch of open
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.880]   sand and stuff there.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   But they very much, for the markup, the web staff, they haven't gone with microformaits,
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.600]   they haven't gone with existing staff.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.400]   They've said, "Here's our own markup, put it in the head."
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   It's our own stuff now.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   That really stinks.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.480]   Is it FML or is it?
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.960]   It's no, it's meta tags.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   It's meta.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.600]   So it's still XML?
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   It's not a test.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.280]   It's a opportunity to promote a standard and they totally didn't do it.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   That's sad.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.360]   Some of the scheme is there an overlap, but at this point they didn't pick up the activity
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.200]   stream stuff, we'll use the activity streams community.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.800]   We've been trying to define this stuff in a collective way to drive that.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.000]   So it's very much, we've decided what the schema of the world looks like and here it
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   is.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.560]   Turns out, Christmas scene is should have taken a job at Facebook.Google.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560]   They could have used it.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.760]   Yeah, I think that's quite fair.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.440]   I think the guys who've been doing the open stuff, they have been doing good work.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:20.200]   And I know Monica just joined there and has been working on this stuff and I'm sure she
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.520]   will help to bring that stuff.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.920]   The Monica Keller that is and will help to bring that stuff back to the open standards
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.800]   that the rest of us are working because she's going to be proponent of those.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.520]   I think what this, there's, there seems to be a lot of Brett Taylor in this and a lot
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   of that is good influence.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.360]   Yeah, Brett's great.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.320]   The API is now much cleaner and much more sensible than it was before.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.280]   If you actually compare the API they've got now, it's much closer to the sort of cleanliness
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.320]   of the friend feed API than the sort of accumulated craft of the previous Facebook API.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.240]   But at the same time, it's still a, we've decided what the parameters that define the
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.000]   world are and here they are.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.520]   Brett, we should say it was co-founder of Friend Feed and CEO.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:06.400]   And along with Paul Bucheit, the big acquisition of Friend Feed was really about these guys.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.800]   And now it's clear that they're not there to develop Friend Feed, but they've brought
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.120]   their good work to Facebook.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   So that's great.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:21.040]   Mark Zuckerberg said, "The web is at an important turning point."
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.840]   He says, "The default has been most things aren't social and don't use your real identity.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.320]   Facebook is looking to change that."
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.680]   He also said that when he was a kid, he remembers thinking, "Man, the world could be a lot better
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.000]   and we can make it that way."
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.240]   So I feel better about the whole thing now.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   What is that?
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   Doctor Who?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240]   What are you watching?
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.080]   Doctor Who?
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   Doctor Who?
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.880]   We're going to let you take that call.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.080]   KevinMarkzRibbit.com, R-I-B-B-I-T.com.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.040]   It's great to have you on.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.720]   Thank you for doing this on such short notice.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.960]   Really good to have your comments on all of this.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.000]   And if anybody doesn't know who Kevin Markz is, just go to Wikipedia and you'll see what
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.440]   a legend he is in this business and how many things he's had a hand in, including the other
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.520]   day, Kevin's in the studio and I'm talking about getting Skype better and stuff.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.200]   And he said, "Well, when we wrote iChat, we made sure it did and I thought, 'Oh, of
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   course, doi.'"
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   Next time, we'll use iChat.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.200]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   Really great to have you.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.680]   Also, on our new time, we really appreciate your flexibility, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.200]   I know you have a train to catch and people to see.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.480]   I want to show you that I've got my replacement for the iPad.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   What is that?
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   Whoa.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   What is that thing?
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   A TRS 200?
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   Was that from Tandy?
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   What is that?
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480]   What is that?
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   What is that?
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   Oh, the moro.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.880]   Oh, my God.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.520]   The first portable computer, not transportable, like an Osborne or Capro.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:55.280]   So I now have my museum of dead technology boarding in my office here in New York.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.600]   This thing weighs about 20 pounds.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.520]   George moro was a great guy, a real innovator and brilliant fellow.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.720]   And I always wanted one of those.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.880]   I'm impressed that you have one.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   Okay.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   Didn't it come with WordStar?
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   I believe it did.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   Yeah, with WordStar and the whole office.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.320]   Just D batteries.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.160]   Making it even looks more heavy.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.760]   Well, it might help with my iPhone.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   We use some D batteries.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.200]   I could last all day.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.880]   I think the new one has a replaceable battery, at least if that prototype, that $5,000 prototype
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.040]   has anything to do with it.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.480]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com, the author of a great book that you have to read if
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.560]   you want to understand what Google's up to.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.560]   It's called What Would Google Do?
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   We appreciate you being here.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   Is this time working for you?
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560]   Good.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560]   It's great for me.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.480]   I just showed out a little bit earlier.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.320]   Gina Trapani is, what can I say?
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   The greatest.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.720]   She's the author of the complete guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com and blogs
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.760]   at smartawear.org and is giving us a great view of New York City.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.960]   Yay for Twig on Wednesday.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   Yay.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960]   Look at that Skyline.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.960]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   That's a, see, she's got a better view than you do, Jeff.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960]   My nose is a Skyline.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.840]   Yeah, much better view that Jeff's looking at at a quadrangle.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.360]   You're looking at the World Trade Center.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.360]   New York, baby.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360]   New York, New York.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   We're so glad you're here.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:19.600]   Again, we do this show now Wednesday afternoons, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 1 p.m.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.680]   Pacific, 2000 UTC at live.twig.tv.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:27.160]   And of course, because we're doing the show earlier, we'll get the show out now on Thursday,
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.160]   maybe even Wednesdays.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.360]   I think we'll try to get it out on Wednesdays, if not early Thursday.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.760]   So you can listen to this during your week, which we think will be a better time for the
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.560]   show.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.240]   You could subscribe, of course, at iTunes and the Zoom Marketplace and everywhere, better
