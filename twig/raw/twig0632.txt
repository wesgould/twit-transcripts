[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.560]   Was trying to think of something of four seasons only like
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   Crank like a man. I don't know. I don't I can't
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.840]   That's a pruit who's doing the four seasons voices today from a really bad falsetto hands-on
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.920]   Photography all not is also the community manager at our fabulous club Twitter has arranged
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.520]   I don't know how you did it and AMA with Steve Gibson, which is you know, that's that's
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.280]   Never happens. It'll be more of a fireside chat, but we will take some questions, so okay. Oh, so he's Steve's already told you
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.760]   I'm not answering any questions. Yeah, he said no do get out of here
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   He's really looking forward to it. It's gonna be fun. Yes
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.360]   And he's popped into the discord to to acknowledge everyone. Oh good. Oh nice
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.720]   What time will that be?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.440]   That'll be 10 a.m. Pacific times are on Friday October 8 Friday morning, and they'll be
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   It'll be recorded and you can hear it on the twit plus feed. I presume that's correct
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   So twit plus and the discord are all features of club twit
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.000]   Which is our you know our little membership thing our little attempt to to get kind of listener support
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.520]   And if you are a listener and you want to support us and you want to hear the Steve
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   Event coming up this Friday. It's easy enough go to twit.tv/club twit and
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.840]   Sign up cost you seven bucks a month you do it. There's a lot of benefits you get ad-free versions of all of our shows
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.400]   you get
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.360]   The the discord access which and discord is fabulous. I mean there's a lot of other stuff
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.680]   There's it's like a chatroom for all the shows, but it goes on all the time
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.200]   So it's not just during the shows. There's all sorts of stuff going on
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.640]   In the end the discord and then there's that special twit plus feed which is stuff that doesn't make it the podcast
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.760]   Like the Giz Fizz and the Linux show and so on and our discord friends were putting up all kinds of
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.120]   Possible stories. I added one to the rundown what I saw. Oh nice. Thank you
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.560]   Yeah, our IRC people do that too, and it's exactly it's a
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.640]   I sometimes it caught the scooter X a change log because that would be correct
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.240]   It's like 20 more things new at Google every week. So good. Thank you for everybody participates
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   We have a wonderful community, and I I
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.640]   Appreciate it so again this Friday 10 a.m. If you're not a member of club twit and you want to attend
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   Go to twit.tv/club twit Wow. This was a very busy week. I kind of almost want to start with the Facebook stuff
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.760]   Facebook was down of course on Monday
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.280]   Which I know it's all the timing is a little suspicious
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.400]   Given that it was the next day after Francis how can we now who know who the whistleblower was?
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   Went on 60 minutes and then the day before she testified in front of the Senate
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.820]   And I think fairly damning
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.880]   testimony
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.760]   Facebook
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   The Verge said took a page out of big tobacco by instead of addressing her accusations
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   Attacking her
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.080]   And that you know I think is a little bit frustrating
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   Facebook's very common. Yeah, I mean that's how you take out a whistleblower. Yeah
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.360]   And so I think that's a little unfortunate Cara Swisher asked Alex Stamos
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.960]   What they should have said and he had a wonderful statement saying
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.760]   Basically we brought in people like her to work on these issues and it's too bad
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.240]   She's not still they're working on them, but we're trying to do this and that you know, they could have they could have done it right there
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   Was nothing they could say
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.560]   There was really nothing they could say
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   Definitely would have given him a little better light though
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   This is basically saying hey
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.760]   We acknowledge these are our concerns and we want to make this better and she is clearly qualified for this and but nope
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   She's a bit little shadow. Yeah, you can't just start to be an evil start hard to stop isn't it?
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.840]   It's it's part of your emo. You're like, uh, how do we do this?
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.800]   Discreditor today Facebook wrote a Senate sub commas commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former project manager at Facebook
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.000]   Who worked for the company for less than two years had no direct reports?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.320]   Never attended a decision point meeting with sea level executives and testified more decision time
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.280]   What the heck is that? Yeah, six times to not working on the subject matter in question
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.400]   But she had documents. Yeah, and the documents were sufficient. Yeah, they don't play these things
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.800]   Well, they don't know how to me. I was thinking all week. This is a very much a stacy moment of
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.480]   Well, we need a conversation and this is cause of conversation
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.040]   And to me what's more interesting than than even what she said is the conversation around it
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.320]   Right and and a lot of people are afraid after the testimony what I heard from the people I trust like
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   Masnick and as Nick Jeff Kossif and and and nate personally and Kate Klonick and daphty Keller and all those folks
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.120]   Is we could be heading toward kind of a government disinformation arm, which on the wrong hands could be really scary
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.840]   And so there were things about it that might have the wrong way
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.640]   But there were there were things that need to be discussed. They personally had a great op and I put in all kinds of
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   Takes on this everybody had a take on this
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   And and was suggesting legislation around
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.640]   Transparency of data. I think that's the my hope is that's what comes out of this
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.360]   Is a structure for transparency of data so researchers can find out what the real impact is
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.840]   And and that would be the conversation. I think they need to ban fenced right here right now
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.040]   And then it'll be okay. This is the reason I understand why will you commit the bandie? How
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.800]   Running fenced this sir. I really understand why people are reluctant to let congress
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   Way on in this and I think fris is hogging propose the whistleblower proposed
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.720]   Something that doesn't necessarily involve lawmaking they that you know dick bloomin's on others really pressed her
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.320]   Well, shall we make a law? What was she and she kind of had to say well? Yeah, you should make a law
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.440]   But really I thought what she said about moral bankruptcy was interesting
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.960]   She basically said the right thing is for facebook to do at this point would be to say
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.120]   Yeah
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.400]   We screwed up
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.320]   More we declare moral bankruptcy. We did something wrong and we don't know how to stop it
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.680]   We don't know how to fix it, which is completely legitimate. It's a tough
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   Where it is. Yeah, and so it's a what facebook should say is it's we we don't know how to fix it
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.000]   But we would like your help and I don't mean congress should make a law
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560]   She said change section 230. I think that's exactly not a thing to do
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.600]   Uh what what facebook should do
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.360]   You know facebook's defense was well, we did all this research
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   You know, we do care do it. Yeah, but we didn't do anything about it facebook should a release all the research in full
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.480]   They're hiding the results of the research. Yeah, they did it
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.360]   But they don't want anybody to know how damaging facebook can be
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.520]   and then be
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.040]   And stop blocking legit researchers like nyu
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   From doing their own research on facebook data
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.040]   Let's let's put light in here
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.760]   I was thinking about this before the show and and and how to how to tackle this
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.000]   and and
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.160]   There's a lot of talk about algorithms being bad and I hate the demonization of algorithms
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.000]   And I even hate the demonization of tarkanine and well she and she did say which I agree with her put it in chronological order
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.960]   That's what everybody else. That's that's why I disagree. That's why I disagree
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.400]   You have that option now and it turns it off every time
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.720]   Um, let me let me just also work on beefy. Let me turn on when you go back
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   It will be off again. Let me ask a question. I think the real focus that comes out
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   Is and it's the same problem media. It is the attention economy and metrics based on engagement
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.680]   Yes, so if you're gonna rebuild if you if tomorrow you own facebook get all the three of you
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.920]   you are the new board of directors of facebook and
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.840]   Engagement metrics are decided to be corrupting
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.800]   What metrics would you use to decide what a good feed is and what a good business is?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.200]   Well, she said it's something that's important
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.280]   Which is you might in this short term make less money if you turn off
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.680]   Yeah, yeah, I'm fine with that
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.160]   I believe facebook will do better because it will be less damaging to its users
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.920]   I think I think that's simplistic and I think that's that's wrong. I doesn't use my question
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   Is it though?
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.440]   About it. Here's what facebook said when they their promise when they came along was
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.640]   Follow your friends and family
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.680]   See what they're up to and share what you're up to with them
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.160]   That is not what facebook does anymore because of algorithmic
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   Well, it's because it wants to sell ads
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.680]   You don't understand why it does it
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.600]   But it could still sell ads against what it promised to get lied to us
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   It said give us give us your content follow your friend
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.240]   But judge what we liked based on engagement and if you're gonna go back to my question if engagement is a bad metric
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   Let's just go back to what you promised
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.400]   But then even then you have too many posts in a day as as I think it was
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.560]   No, no, you're only gonna see the random little bit of fine. That's what twitter is too
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.440]   I know it's up to you. It's up to you. That's not true. By the way, that's not true
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.360]   Look if I follow my mom my kids and my high school sweetheart
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.920]   I am not gonna see too many posts in a day. Okay. I don't want to just follow those those three people
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.240]   I want to follow and find more interesting people
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.040]   But I also want to I want some prioritization and that's not facebook
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.840]   You're doggie my question, which is if you could redesign facebook around a better
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.640]   algorithm you follow what you're interested in
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.200]   That's what twitter was until recently what if you buy for catered what if you buy for catered it into
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.760]   Personal so leo you will only be you'll be kind of like a freeloader on facebook in the sense that you're only going to follow your close friends and family
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   Jeff might be someone who's willing to
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   Follow a wider assortment of people and see different ads. I mean the issue is there's not a large cut
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.120]   That's the issue. It's whether facebook's in control of what you see or you're in control of what you see
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.480]   Yeah, that's all fine. I want to make those controls more obvious
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.560]   But I go back to my yahoo. We had control of my yahoo. Nobody went back to it
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.080]   Because of the pain people don't do personal though. They don't do dials. What are you talking about my yahoo?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.360]   I don't know what you're talking back of the day. We all set up my yah
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.880]   That was a news page that wasn't about following friends or family
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.680]   No, that wasn't just saying when you say people want more control and I agree philosophically
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.200]   I'm not sure people are complicated. You're already doing that when you join facebook
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.480]   You follow your friends effect you do it. You have a wonderful facebook feed
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   You go through this beautiful facebook feed
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   You go through this dumb exercise that facebook wants you to think
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.760]   You're going to get to see what you ask to see
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.280]   And instead they tell you what you're going to see and if you even if you follow your mom
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   You will not see all of her posts
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   You may not see any of her posts, right?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.920]   And I get my surprises in facebook that I wouldn't have seen if I just stuck the prawn on when I go in every three
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.720]   You know what we're gonna have to throw that little serendipity thing out
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.280]   That's the mistake is the face face and you've returned to mass media
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.920]   No, you haven't just it's exactly the opposite
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.760]   You've returned to personal media. You're following what you want
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.160]   Not what facebook tells you you want. That's the whole problem in a nutshell
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.040]   And it by the way, they make plenty of money doing that
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.200]   You could you could put a dial for more or less serendipity
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.840]   Mm-hmm. Yes
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.440]   I guess
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.600]   I don't know it seems like it does a bad job with this serendipity. Yes, that's the nuts
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.680]   Suggest that's the name
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.800]   Clicked on well, that's because their metric was engagement and if you are gonna show people
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:52.720]   If you're gonna surprise people with stuff, you can't surprise them with anything that's less than like a six or seven on the oh my god scale
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.360]   You know exactly
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:02.720]   My mcloo get I we're gonna have to stop right now the I my facebook's fine thing
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.480]   That's people say that all the time about all of this stuff. Yeah, mine's fine. What's your problem?
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.960]   Why don't you start? No, why are you telling me to stop that because it's not useful?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:20.000]   That doesn't solve the problem. Yes, it is because because it's because the presumption and the narrative is that every single feed on facebook
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.120]   Okay, I'm gonna tell you how your experience isn't useful. That's what I'm saying. Thank you older white man
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:35.200]   Who has a very different experience based on the types of things you're interested in the types of people you follow then
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.760]   Yeah, a lot of other people and your experience is gonna also be different because of the fact that you're you know a guy
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:49.520]   Yes, I all true, but I also choose I ignore people I don't like I get rid of them and it makes life perfectly pleasant
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.160]   Okay, so you ignore people
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:00.240]   Served up to you about algorithm or is it someone? No, I don't follow them. I I get rid of them. It's not hard
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.080]   Well, there's no problem facebook's fine. What's the problem Jeff facebook's great
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   Facebook is great. Okay, if there's a way my little bar is great. So clearly my neighborhood is great
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.920]   I've got some if you're in there in it. Well, I ignore them Jeff if you're in the facebook is great camp
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.440]   Thanks. Anyway, we'll talk to somebody else about it because you're in the very small minority that says facebook's great
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.480]   You say nothing
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   Show me the day to say
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.320]   So 2 billion people are miserable. They're all there because they hate it and they're miserable
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   Also, this is also i think at least sagram and what's up and I think that's worth noting because
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.560]   Some of our most vulnerable people are not on facebook, but they are on what's app or at this point
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.160]   At this point Jeff you're just saying there's no problem. So move on
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.440]   No, I'm not saying that at all. You know, I've just spent time saying that there's a problem
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   And I'm trying to get to a more helpful
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:06.560]   Constructive way to rebuild facebook from scratch saying that there's a huge problem with their business model built on attention and on
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.800]   Engagement so you're there's a problem here. There's a problem here, but your feet is fine
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.040]   I'm just saying this possible. The problem is in facebook problem is people nine doing a good job with their feet
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.280]   Well, you're the ones who are saying it was more control. I have never used that control
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.520]   Your argument is my experience is good. So we don't need to change anything. That is like
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.280]   I just argued for huge fundamental change in facebook
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.440]   All i'm saying is number one if you think that every single facebook feed is awful
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   Then you're basically accusing how many people now three billion people of being back to the idiots
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.400]   We're just saying they're at all facebook's putting its thumb on the scale
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.680]   And creating huge problems with their algorithms
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.920]   They know that there's a problem and they bury the research
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.280]   When somebody comes out agreeing with them when someone comes out with a research and says here's the problem
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   They say well that person really doesn't know what they're talking about what I want to disagree with you on is go to krono and everything is okay
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.200]   That's that's ridiculous
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.760]   I've seen pure krono facebook and i've seen pure krono twitter and i don't like them very much
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   I think that's what facebook found you facebook did not promise us that they will show you what you want as opposed to
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.440]   The very beginning the news feed promised they were going to be be selecting what would you would find interesting them very beginning
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.640]   Now again, i'm saying there's a fundamental problem there i'm not i'm not arguing with you guys on that
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:33.840]   I'm just saying that this is you do you think twitter got better when you break them up or that stuff is choose to stick and there's a harder question here
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.680]   So facebook shows you things you don't follow right it's it picks stuff for you right
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.000]   Does twitter do that?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   Twitter knows too
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.240]   Yeah
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.400]   Twitter shows your stuff happens because
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.160]   A friend of mine follows something a friend of mine liked it a friend of mine did something and then it comes
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.360]   But always comes to you as a retweet from a friend, but you don't
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.720]   Twitter doesn't inject stories. Oh, yeah twitter puts it. Oh, no twitter does sir twitter will put a
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.400]   Post right there on your screen that says so and so replied to this where that i was interested in it or not
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.160]   It only put it there. Oh, I don't see that I turn it off so twitter is fine
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:14.320]   I'm trying to say that there's a more fundamental problem slap him and slime you can scream about
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.600]   How the world was helpful well, I just disagree with you. I think the problem is the problem is algorithms
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.560]   That's the problem. That's that's the problem with youtube. That's the problem with facebook if twitter is doing that
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.400]   That's the problem with twitter. It is the algorithms are not optimized for anything except engagement
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.960]   And I don't want this is what france of how can said when you optimize for engagement you optimize for extremism
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.720]   What else could you optimize for is what i'm trying to get you to address
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.000]   Engagement that's that's what we're doing right now is going for engagement people can say hey
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.520]   Those are the other than the all about this and that we're going for engagement right now two and a half hours worth
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.720]   That's what we do too. Yeah, what is the alternative to I do
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:00.000]   I still believe it's good for people to talk with each other and find a way to connect on let me ask you this
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   So how do we do a better job? Let me ask you this then is facebook a media property
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   No, you've heard of this before no, okay, but
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.640]   So media media optimize for engagement
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.600]   Because that's the job
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.000]   What is facebook and twitter and google took all on media's business model? Yes
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.840]   Because the ad industry that's what the ad industry buys
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.560]   You're going to get back. You can't have it. Both. If you ask me you can't have it both ways
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   Either facebook is a platform for people to share with one another
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.960]   Which they would like to pretend they are or they are media which optimize for engagement
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   You can't have it both ways. I don't think
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.800]   Yeah, I think that's fair what you just said
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   That is a pretend going on here. Yes, they want us to connect
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:57.280]   Yeah, they want us to connect that was their emission way back when but they also want to profit make a crap ton of money
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.760]   And all the way to do that is to algorithmically
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.640]   Show us stuff that's going to have people more engaged on it whether it's great content or really really horrific content
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.000]   Something that's going to make people hit like something that's going to make people hit
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.040]   Reshare and comment on it over and over and over again. That's that's where they want to win
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.960]   So what would be a better job? What would be a better? So you want to start a whole new
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:24.320]   By the way, Jeff, I've told you four times what my solution is and you just reject it out of hand
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.880]   You see, I can't do that. I do
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.120]   Well, no, I do because if I want to follow more than 10 people it's going to be able to follow anybody
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.640]   I want I want some let me
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.120]   I want some mechanism to help choose that no Facebook should not put it
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   No, Facebook should not put it's thumb on the scale because Facebook cannot be trusted to do that because they're going to optimize for
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.360]   Profit there. They're doing it to the wrong metrics is what I'm trying to get to. No, no
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.960]   They're doing it to the exact right metrics any choice any
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.200]   Yes, just as we optimize for engagement any media business should optimize for engagement
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   They're doing it to the exact right metrics if they're a media platform if they are a sharing platform
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.240]   They shouldn't put their thumb on the scale at all. You should follow who you want and see what you want. Period
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:15.520]   I don't see why that's not a service. They tried this way. So Jack Dorsey in his talk of was a blue sky or whatever it's called
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.680]   Right
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.760]   Envision a different architecture where where speaking is the commodity platform
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.800]   But there's a value added layer where people find this stuff that's worth listening to I want that service
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.360]   I want someone to go as I did with my
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.880]   I put this to someone the scale with my covid twitter list
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.680]   I chose 600 people I am god
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.960]   And I found this value in it right and I offered it to others and you can take my suggestions
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   You can reject them, but I
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.320]   Did put my thumb on the scale to that extent right I chose I want that as a service
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.600]   But if it's done, but what you did is human to you
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:01.280]   No, if it's done to pure engagement and attention it will be corrupted. So what are other mechanisms?
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.960]   There is just I must say it one more time
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.800]   Yeah, you're really thick on this. There is only one mechanism which is to optimize for profit
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   That's the only mechanism before profit company will will use that that is optimizing for engagement. They are equal
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.440]   And the minute facebook puts its thumb on the scale in any direction
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.120]   They're going to optimize for profit. It would be dumb of them to optimize to make less money. Why would they do that?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.160]   Um
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.800]   There argument there. I want to hear from Stacey here because I've been talking about all the three guys been talking to much but I'll
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.720]   answer your one question there argument there is
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.800]   um
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.720]   That a bad experience is not profitable in the long run
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.640]   Right and if this is such a cesspool and such a miserable experience and if people come here and all they see is hate
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   Um and and that we force me to do that. That's bad business now. That's
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.320]   glib
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.080]   But I think there's an underlying point there that says that if this thing is so miserable to so many people
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.720]   Then it's not in the long run going to be a good business
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:15.440]   So are there other measures of quality and value to people in their lives?
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.760]   Uh
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.680]   That yes may not be as profitable as hogging says, but we're trying to end up at the same place there
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.840]   We're just trying to get there in different ways. You see only one that has to say this is all facebook
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:33.200]   Some of some of it is the users too. We we do have a choice to not use these platforms and not
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.920]   Engage on the stuff that we see pushed up through that over
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.840]   But you know if you're a qn on fan and you want to follow all qn on stuff on facebook
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.560]   You should absolutely be allowed to I think facebook wants to be a media company
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.960]   But pretends it's a platform for sharing
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.360]   And it's in it that's exactly how they got into this problem
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.880]   And as soon as they put their thumb on the scale in favor of profit
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.920]   AKA engagement they're equal
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.040]   That's when you get this problem and youtube's done and now twitter's doing it and in all three cases
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.680]   That's when extremism gets pumped up
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.760]   I don't think you should see anything you don't follow on any platform
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   Then you would solve it
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.920]   Yeah, and if you're think your your friends family and the new sources you want to follow are boring
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.160]   You're not saying that you're saying it's too much
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.000]   So you're going to let facebook curate it. Well, that's a media platform
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.040]   Showed you some new york times and some washing and posing some drink
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.600]   I can find the new york times wash. I can find all that stuff myself that becomes a media platform
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.880]   That's a curation platform inherently problematic
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.520]   curation
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.120]   For a mccompany optimizing for profit is inherently problematic. Stacy you agree? We do disagree
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.400]   I think you can't do anything at scale when it comes to
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.680]   moderating or
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.160]   If you're going to pick in this this is actually this is common across all
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.920]   In anything technological anything that requires computation
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.560]   Whether it's using like sensors to optimize factory production or trying to optimize for engagement
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.160]   If you're trying to optimize for profit, which people are
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.800]   at a large scale
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.480]   Things are going to
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.840]   People are going to gum up the work. So maybe it's people being jerks
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.280]   Maybe it's people slacking off on their breaks or getting rsi
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.360]   Injuries because they can't work as hard as you would like to optimize them for
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.480]   The point is we have faith in technology to solve these problems
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:39.840]   But we can't apply technology uniformly to people in any way whatsoever
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.680]   To do otherwise is to break free will right you end up with this horrible dystopian place
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.920]   So knowing that all of our companies are going to use technology to optimize right now for profitability
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   If they're publicly traded that's cool their fiduciary duty in most of their cases
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.960]   We have to figure out how to price in
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.000]   All the externalities that they're ignoring so if it's social media
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.080]   We have to figure out what are harm what are the externalities that we're ignoring?
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.640]   What are the harms and how do we mitigate those and that's kind of what you're asking jeff
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.200]   But you're saying it it's not what do you optimize for it's how do you
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.040]   Price in things knowing that you they're like that a lot optimize for profit. So I like that a lot
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.640]   And that and that goes to the you know when I was on my transatlantic high-level working for the content moderation freedom expression
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.080]   Where what we came to was where I think the discussion heads now
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:40.480]   Where may personally from stanford heads is we have to get the data out of facebook to understand what the impact is to then
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.960]   Uh, I used to say create those interventions, but I think you're right to then identify the costs
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:53.840]   And and now facebook just says we're gonna throw through 40 000 people getting rid of of crappy content. Okay, okay
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.520]   That that's that's not it. I mean while people who are getting
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.480]   Horrash to have nowhere to go
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.880]   Uh because that's not valued because there's no cost put to that. So I like that a lot stacey
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   I think that's a great mechanism
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.120]   To look and say there's cost to everything right there's cost to cars and so we add in the seat belts
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.280]   We require every manufacturer to do that. We all agree. We're gonna spend money on that right?
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.360]   So that's an interesting thing to say when you have people online, which I celebrate
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.400]   What are the costs that and that we now know?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.600]   End up coming and what do we do about that? What do we demand as investment against that? Is that a fair summary?
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.360]   It is but you have to also be aware that you know, everybody's externalities are going to be a little bit different like
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.000]   Some people think the cost of like a cheap consumer good is
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.960]   More valuable to them than the cost of preserving the environment right?
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.800]   Right because they're thinking short term versus longer. So I mean this is hard
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.880]   This is this is why I'm always like we need a new one's discussion and we need to decide what we want to give up
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.040]   What we don't which is how you get the policy. Yes
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.840]   So, okay, hey, let's talk about failures because y'all
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.040]   This is this is so much failures
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   Can we talk about do we want to talk about bgp and dns or do we not care about that at all?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.240]   I think we've actually talked about it quite a bit on
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.960]   On security now and other security now
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   We can do we can do the run
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.160]   We don't have to do the rundown if you're doing it to change the subject. I don't mind if
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   Do you want to change your subject or are you really fascinated?
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.560]   I would like to talk about gp anything other than this. Yeah
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:32.960]   This is the top this is the top story of the week though. This is really I know the top story
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.840]   I mean, I guess you're right. We're not going to make any progress at this point
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.720]   Y'all are just going y'all are getting real loud and cranky and
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.440]   Oh, no
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   Each other structure from just passionate
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.960]   This this triggers all kinds of craziness. I'm a bad punted. I can't even listen to you
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.200]   Well, I can't I need you to hold my hand through this
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.360]   I got you. I got you. I got you. I think in the long run
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.640]   I think in the long run what's going to happen if you add all the data and you do all the research and less stuff is you
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.040]   Just going to come up again and again with the problem that
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:19.680]   Facebook it says it's a platform is a media company is optimizing for engagement because it's profitable and there really isn't
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.840]   there
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.240]   Either it's a media company in which case you can say it's Fox News. I mean like I'm not saying Fox News
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.960]   Uh should be stopped
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.840]   They're engaged they're optimizing for engagement. That's fine. Yeah, and your choice is not to watch it or watch it
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.120]   At whatever whichever you please I don't think that is an issue
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.360]   I think it's a much bigger issue that Facebook promises
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.680]   Something and delivers something else and it does it in a very sneaky way
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.320]   I think the real reason they don't release this data is they don't really want people to understand
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.120]   A how much they're algorithmically massaging your feed and B the consequences of that whether it's instagram or facebook
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.720]   What's app doesn't really come into this conversation because
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:07.760]   It's just a messaging platform. In fact, what's app I would see there's a lot of damage going on. Yeah, which you're algorithm
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.640]   But what are you there? No, I agree. What's app you're only talking to people that you actively talk to
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.800]   Um, what I don't know what you're gonna do about that. So what so jeff, that's the same thing. That's a common carrier problem
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   There's all sorts of horrible stuff going on in the telephone company, but it's not their responsibility
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:34.240]   And I hate to throw children since we're gonna if we're gonna keep talking about this we have to focus less on
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:41.680]   the jeff's situation and more on how the kids are I agree, I thought it was interesting. Congress really focused
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   The senators really focused it about kids and I think that's politically safer and easier than saying
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.640]   It is important to I mean, we have to protect our kids
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.560]   And like and I'm not saying this like is some sort of pro clutch and crazy lady
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.520]   I'm just saying this from the standpoint of here's here's
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.920]   What instagram and facebook tell kids
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.320]   Put your pictures on here and and look at the pictures of your friends
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:13.360]   And it's very simple and and you know, I think there probably are issues with adolescent girls
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.880]   Looking at their friends pictures and getting, you know, bad body image messages and so forth
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.640]   That's a societal problem. I don't think that that's instagram's problem
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.000]   I don't think instagram should be required to somehow
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.680]   And I don't even know how they would fix that. I don't think that's fixable
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:36.800]   You can also see like and I don't know where instagram falls on this but like, you know how tiktok prioritizes certain
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.200]   Uh, you know, they what's the word i'm looking for brings to the for you page things like
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.960]   Tiktok is a perfect example of the opposite of a totally algorithmic feed
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   I follow the my son for instance and he never shows up when I look at following
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   They are not they are literally not showing me his content because they've decided algorithmically. I don't want to see food content
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.240]   So that's the tiktok is the actual worst of the thing. I mean
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.960]   That's as bad as you can get and I am
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.400]   I'm not gonna slam tiktok because henry's getting to a million followers needs to
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.280]   But honestly tiktok tiktok is a perfect example of what's wrong with this stuff
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.600]   And you know what that's the next one where you're gonna hear i'm surprised you're not hearing more of it
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.960]   Oh my god, they're not a us based company. Right. What are you gonna do?
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.920]   That's can't hold yeah, well they can take it's bannin
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:38.240]   Um, yeah, that's gonna go. I think honestly. I I think algorithm is the problem. I don't I think the promise face book gave us
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   No, it is it's absolutely the worst in the out you're demonizing algebra
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.000]   No, no, I'm not demonizing algebra. He's not demonizing algebra. He's demonizing the people who use out
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.960]   The fact that you can't scale an algorithm you have to pick something to optimize for and if you're optimizing for profit
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.640]   You're gonna optimize for engagement. It's just not nuanced like add there's no way you can say well
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.920]   I think we're gonna make the sale give them a little bit better. So it doesn't hurt children. You can't nuance it you can't
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:13.040]   It's an algorithm and I'm not demonizing the algorithm. I'm demonizing the people who use it's the same thing in world of warcraft
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.280]   When you play in world of warcraft wait a minute what no no listen when you play world of warcraft no no
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.920]   It's there's a very this is clearer. So it's less charged when you play world of warcraft
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.280]   You bet you team up with other players to go on raids, right?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   And when you go on raids you get loot drops so the the people who do world of warcraft watch
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:40.720]   Very closely your engagement time in world of warcraft and they tie it to the loot drops they can tune the loot drops
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   To make sure you engage more
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.400]   There's a loop rub it's just stuff you get from the raid and it's all made up
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:55.600]   Stuff you get from the winnings and just like it well vaguest does the same thing you think vegas doesn't pay very close attention to what
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:02.320]   Payoffs make you play slot machines longer. It's all all of this engagement stuff is all the same
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   They are feedback loops and the problem with technology is a very rapid feedback loop
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.760]   And pretty much the humans don't get involved they can they can tweak little factors
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.720]   But they it's a it's what jeff bezos
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.800]   Calls the flywheel that gets faster and faster and faster and it happened with world of warcraft became very addictive
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.440]   Because they knew exactly how to tune it for optimization for engagement
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.160]   And I think that's exactly what's happening on facebook's exactly what's happening on youtube
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.840]   Um, and when you optimize for that kind of engagement you let you lose control of what's happening
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   There's no way to tweak it to make it uh safe that would that's a fool's errand
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.120]   Was fascinated is as much as sometimes the instagram algorithm pisses me off
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:54.880]   I look at youtube and i'm like, how what is youtube doing different to make the algorithmic experience much more enjoyable for me
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:01.200]   But do you use instagram can't fight instagram's interesting because they don't show you at the top of your feed anybody you don't follow
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.840]   They save that for later
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.400]   After you've gone through all of the factors i've gone through my current stuff. It'll say it. I'm caught up
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:15.760]   Now there's stuff you might like this other stuff out and then i'm like, uh, i'm out. Yeah, that's the algorithm. I'm like, what are you doing wrong here?
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:22.720]   YouTube doesn't do that for me. Well might not work for you, but it might work for others, you know, remember they're not optimizing for you
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.360]   Right, right. Right
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.840]   How selfish of me self-centered
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.960]   um
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.360]   Anyway, i'm just shutting up because he doesn't want to get into fight, but uh,
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   I'm on through another date. I tried to start to have
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.600]   You're saying that i'm trying i'm trying to use them otherwise and you say it's simply impossible so we disagree about that
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.440]   I think the i the internet is young and if we say that the internet is finished and these are the only owners and we're screwed
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.280]   Then we have possibility and the agency to build the internet that's saying that what what a social network look like
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.880]   Where people can connect you have one answer which is a you follow all the people you get you got all of that
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.000]   I don't think that's a very good experience. You want a media experience
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.480]   Yeah, we've said it already
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.600]   Um, you know master done you only see what you follow
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:15.120]   It's a very good, uh, social experience that's social i'm seeing the people i follow they see me
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.800]   We have conversations. I don't see what's so bad about that jeff
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.360]   Your only argument against it is it's too much
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.160]   We'll stop following so many people
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.120]   But do you have the one you want and i'll have the one i want and why can't we have that because
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:38.720]   A media platform pretending to be a social media platform is problematic. Well, let's get to the real basis
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.400]   Close
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.080]   There you go. Thank you as a wolf and she's cliving. Thank you. It's using the engagements
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.920]   Let's go father. It's using the engagement technique
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:52.880]   To the fox news on a what purportedly social site and that's not what you're getting. That's why it's problematic
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.600]   Well, let's talk about atnt and oan not to change the subject yet. I'm sure we'll get to it
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.680]   But the same problem. No, i'm not going to even do this story. I don't even know why this story is in here
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.880]   I know exactly why this i put it in here. Yeah, I find it's a warrior. It's a major warrior story
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.480]   It's not it's not some made up thing
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:17.280]   So one big company funded another decided that to get their merger through and for other other other motives and reasons
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.560]   And to engage certain parts of their audience so that they get more good subscribers
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:27.680]   They basically created a way in so what oh no no no atnt has always been super super conservative
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.720]   Just as a company. Yeah, I don't even understand what's wrong with that
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:36.320]   They're like the coke company, but the kn, yeah, so what's wrong with that?
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.000]   That's what businesses do they create thing is that's a media company
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.320]   I don't have to watch away in and they own it. Yeah, yeah, they own up to that. You don't have to watch facebook
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.000]   Well, I don't as a matter of fact. I don't yeah at all
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   But but I would love it
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.280]   You're the opposite of me you're so you're saying that my experience doesn't work
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   Well, neither does yours because you want to deny everybody experience and say this is so awful
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.240]   So we're different besides the same coin
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.000]   What if we keep this discussion going don't we can don't think or we can move on you don't think facebook is awful
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.080]   You don't think facebook is awful
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.400]   He clearly does not okay. No
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.600]   What if you said you had to be 18 to participate on any of these platforms?
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   I think that makes some sense. However, trying to enforce that
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.560]   Is going to be hell and age verification and lots of other problems actually kids don't want to go
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.200]   Go, I mean they don't want to be on instagram
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:35.040]   You can't keep focusing on facebook in its algorithm. We have to talk about instagram and others too
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.000]   You're right. I don't think instagram is as bad to be honest with you
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.640]   Instagram is horrid
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.760]   It is horrid for kids. They say they're gonna tag each other because they're in parties
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.080]   Then you feel left out that's because that's where the kids are that's a that's a that's a kid problem a society problem
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.840]   I don't know. I don't think that's an instagram. It makes it easy for them to see it
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.520]   That's all it is. It just makes it and then it glamorizes bad things
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.920]   It glamorizes a life people don't how would you prevent that would would you not allow your kids online?
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.160]   Because anything that they do online is going to end up being that
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:20.000]   Yeah, but it's the bullying and things that go on via instagram. Well bullying goes on online in a lot of ways
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.960]   That's a social problem. That's a kid problem
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.400]   But you can go away from it without like if you're all of your friends are communicating in this one place
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.120]   You're going to go to that place if they're all at the watering hole
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.640]   You're gonna be at the watering hole with right well
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.480]   If they all went to the mall and they were bullying at the mall would it be the mall's problem
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.520]   Well, but at the mall it's a lot fewer people can go find you at the mall
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.880]   It's a higher it's a higher friction experience to bully someone at a mall than it is online
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:53.680]   And there's a there's limitations on the number of people who can see you at a mall
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.240]   Well, this is where i'm going to be on jeff'side, which is
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.960]   This is a feature of the internet
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.080]   And and it's a I agree it's problematic, but I don't know if the problem is the internet
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.360]   But you're marketing it or society
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.840]   Um, yeah, but kids are good even if you didn't market it to kids kids would use it
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.200]   Yes, but we were just the problem with the age limit
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:22.960]   That's it's it's harder for kids to buy cigarettes even though kids do still smoke because we implemented laws against it right when I was a kid
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.040]   Mm-hmm, you know, you could still smoke if you really wanted to but it was kind of a pain in the ass
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   So even in china where they are pretty effective laws and they even make you sign up with a driver's license for your internet access
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.640]   Somehow kids under 13 are getting some some people are gonna break through okay, but some people are not
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.080]   I mean that's we can't just say well this law is clearly doesn't bullying happen
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.920]   Through texting as somebody's pointing out in the chat room. It can yes, so but again, you're not
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:55.120]   You don't spread it as far. You don't you can't like oh, I imagine they're group there are group texts that are
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.640]   Yeah, there are group texts, but those group texts
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   I mean being bullied on something like twitter or facebook is a lot different than being bullied by friends in your text thread
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.800]   Even if it's 200 people
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:13.200]   I'm sympathetic. I mean that's horrible when a kid's bullied and the consequences can be devastating and even life-threatening
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.760]   But I don't know if you can
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.320]   I mean that's turning off you say well, you can't go to the mall. You can't turn on the internet
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.640]   You can't turn on texts. You can't have a phone
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.280]   In fact, why don't you just stay home and you won't be bullied? So let's bring in dana boy now who says
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.240]   Yeah, try to over protect our children. We we harm them terribly and they can't find people who feel like them right and right and you lose
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   They lose
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   They're they're growing up. Yeah, because we are lots of kids are bullied on the playground at school
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.600]   Mike my son was
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.680]   It's definitely a balancing act because yeah, yeah, instagram can be quite problematic, but at the same time
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.240]   We hope that these children have some
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.600]   Sensible adults in their life to tell them hey, didn't none of this stuff is is
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.960]   What you think it is people are doing a lot of phony belongs
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.640]   I'll give you a hug and make themselves look better and and and you know
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.680]   They have to try to draw the line and let them know what reality is and what really matters in life and stop buying into the
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.800]   Body shame and stuff. I think it was 2017 or 2018
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.440]   There was a kid that committed suicide at um the hard-head school
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.600]   and that was a really really big ordeal to talk to them, you know, they were much younger and
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.960]   Just seeing that
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.720]   Just seeing how they reacted to it because they just assumed
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:38.480]   Everything was about instagram and snapchat or whatever the apps were at that particular time
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.200]   And I had to tell them look there's more to life than just
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:48.400]   These apps right here. There's there's other things that are going to take precedence and we got to help find the balance
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.840]   Still enjoy your time with your friends on these mobile apps and whatnot
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.480]   But you do have to understand look I'm going to draw the line on this stuff that I catch you posting
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:03.440]   I can't stand these kids posting all of this braggadocious stuff because that's what it leads to at least other people feeling like
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.760]   Everybody is leaving them out and it's not even factual, you know, just
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.040]   Again, just have some sort of sensible adult
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.800]   Around for these children, but I don't even know if that's a guarantee
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.120]   Unfortunately, can I can I use exactly here?
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.320]   It's not so so there's an example today from tiktok
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.920]   Where we see all kinds of stories out there
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.280]   alerting to
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.480]   Trend on tiktok that you should go and slap a teacher
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.280]   Now, yes, I would think that any
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.760]   Sensible students
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.920]   Any sensible parent would
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.720]   Already have taught their kids not to slap teachers your teachers
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.360]   And so a dang
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:53.440]   Tiktok's going to cause this rash and if it does isn't there to Ann's point a different problem that we've got to grapple with
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:45:00.000]   Well, yes, so to these kids having social credibility
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It's like you don't when you're that age and you're like if all of your friends ran off a bridge
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.480]   Would you run do yeah? They would they would do something incredibly stupid because pure acceptance is way more important with them at this stage
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.000]   right
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.960]   A lot of other times
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.280]   Slap to teacher. I mean just because it's just I would like to think that I would like to think that my kid wouldn't either
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.920]   It but there are other kids who are very easily led and they just make them horrible people
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.680]   You know what happens is you become so desperate to get pure acceptance
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.520]   And if it looks like the only or best way to get pure acceptance is by having a viral video on tiktok
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.840]   Then you might it might be worth it to you to slap a teacher just because that pure acceptance is so important to you
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   I can understand but that's one I step in
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.320]   Don't do that. That's that's the dance point
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.600]   Yeah, yeah, but that's when I would step in and say look that that pure acceptance
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.320]   It's it's you know, there's a fine line to it
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.400]   You know, yeah, I know you want to have friends and this and that but you can't go out there and just do stupid crap
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   The problem is you're gonna say that after it happened because you're not even gonna know about it until it does happen
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   You know what I'm saying right?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.120]   Especially as kids get older their lives are now out of our purview
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.000]   We don't see what's going on and it's all about their peer group
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.880]   So you're gonna know about it, but it'll be after they slap the teacher. It's not gonna be before you're a teacher, right?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.560]   I'm mr. Stacey. I lucked out most of the dumb crap
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.240]   I did was in my adult years not so much in my well childhood years because I I was scared of my mom's
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.600]   It's good to be scary. I was terrified of my mom, but my brother totally different person
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:40.320]   Yeah, yeah, my sister's the other thing and this is the substantial difference. None of us grew up in a world where everything was online
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.840]   Right and that is a huge difference. We're then that's kind of what we're grappling with here
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.480]   Is that this generation is growing up in public effectively?
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.240]   Just I just had this conversation with queen prueh yesterday
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.440]   Just said that yeah, we didn't grow up with everything being connected and having the
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:07.840]   Challenges of following the lights and stuff like that. Jeff's totally different take their stuff offline when they turned
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.000]   I've been I've been telling my daughter
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.200]   Like everything down you've ever posted
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:21.120]   It's very hard for the same reason even as an adult
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:26.480]   Peer, you know your peer acceptance your peer group. This is you get values where you could get value
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:33.760]   Did you read jeff ben Thompson's piece in strateccary? I didn't get through it. No, I didn't have time because it's been Thompson
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   It takes forever. I didn't find it
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.720]   It's essentially defensive facebook in a nutshell
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.600]   Facebook's value to the economy giving small businesses and so forth
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.120]   Parity with big businesses
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:53.680]   It's so valuable to the economy that it's it's really important that facebook continue as it has
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.560]   That you know all of that engagement stuff does go to advertising which is all about giving you know
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.640]   So let's stay there for a second. Let's stay there for a second
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.200]   so imagine that rather than trying for
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.120]   CPM based advertising and programmatic based advertising that facebook said we're gonna rebuild
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:18.160]   Around local which is it's not about engagement. It's about local and trust and other things
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.240]   There are way and it'd be a smaller facebook
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.680]   But it's the way to imagine an advertiser supported facebook that
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.160]   Next door is trying to build that right next door is doing that on on real
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.920]   Identity and there are a holes on next door to it. Yes
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.000]   Number two of them off there forever similar problems though with next door because our problem is people
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.520]   What is there are a holes in the world right and and so the question is do we protect do we expect the platform?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.640]   Mr. Protect us from a holes well to an extent. Yes, and that's the other side of the algorithm by the way the algorithm also
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.200]   demotes a lot of stuff
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.840]   And take stuff away that you're not going to want to see because it's crappy
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.560]   Now the problem is there demote and the wrong things and promote the wrong things and that's part of the problem here
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.520]   Is that they haven't defined why they exist and what the experience should be
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.760]   But there is a world I can imagine where
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   social
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   Can be better
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:17.280]   Uh, and so i'm not ready to give on up and neither am i ready to give up on algorithms and curation and and choice
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.760]   I don't think that's a bad thing. I think that that could be value added
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.160]   This is what Ben writes if you'd gotten to the end you would have actually enjoyed this
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.240]   he says
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.040]   that
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.240]   I acknowledge
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:35.520]   A prop some of the problems that facebook particularly the first one about facebook internalizing the fundamental flaws in hearing in humanity
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.800]   In other words to argue it is not in facebook's interest as an ad platform to have angry political
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:48.720]   Discussions doesn't change the reality that having people interact more will entail more angry political discussions
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.080]   Amongst every other discussion that humans are liable to have
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   But this also makes the case for why I don't think the world would be better off
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.600]   if
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.720]   Facebook were a much smaller company it's political problems
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.400]   But for the company in the world are irrevocably tied to its size
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.120]   He's he's arguing that
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.720]   facebook has now become a behemoth and that is inherently problematic and in fact
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.440]   That facebook ultimately will be used for political power
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.480]   He said James Madison predicted this in the federalist papers
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:28.640]   Facebook presents a societal problem not a competitive problem more of her political problem three politicians don't want a smaller facebook
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.920]   They want to use it. They want a compliant facebook
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:38.320]   So the most likely outcome facebook doubles down on information control perhaps with some regulation
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:44.400]   Which I you know, I don't think there's any possible regulation that could actually solve this problem
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.560]   It's just without mucking it up. He says that it's far more likely to hinder new startups
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.200]   Strict your limits on data for example or increasing liability for user generated content
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.160]   Then it is to materially harm facebook not much will change at least in the short term
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.200]   Uh, he makes it. It's a very strong argument
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.080]   It's one I don't like but it makes a very strong argument
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.280]   Kevin roosts also argued today facebook is weaker than we knew
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.120]   Mike maznick I think also was smart about this that that that we're
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.280]   Messiness is facebook weaker than we knew is facebook weak at this point. You think this is a body
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.720]   It will fix its problems. I think that's what kevin's point was
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:26.160]   I think that's what I that's a lot of what i'm seeing is that is that is that they put themselves
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.640]   I mean, here's here's the most dystopian vision
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.920]   Right. I think the congress looks at this and you're right by the way some of the senators who were going after facebook have spent a
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.640]   tons of money on facebook
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.080]   Uh, but people look at this and think that there's a solution
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.840]   And that facebook you could solve this right and probably what you're saying leo is no
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:49.040]   They really can't the part of all this and they really can't that's the that's the question does is this is this is this?
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.040]   Is this train gotten out of facebook's hands and they don't know what to do with it now?
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.400]   I think that's the more dystopian view here and that's why
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.680]   I hang around with academics even though i'm not one i want a lot more research
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.200]   To understand this better because what we're doing is having a huge discussion and a policy discussion
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:15.040]   On presumption and and I want to know more about this and facebook is the only path to getting that knowledge because they have the damn data
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.840]   That to me is the essence of this entire story right now now others might say too late forget it
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.960]   It's it's it's ruined the world. It's awful. We should just turn it off. But that's where I think
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.920]   Um, sretetry is really interesting to say well, no not only the advertising piece
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:37.040]   But also the george floyd story also the my students who worked with people who were food poor in the midwest during the pandemic
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.640]   And facebook was the mechanism by which they did that you know, I think you all you would agree
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.600]   It's not all bad. Whoa, I absolutely agree
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:49.520]   Would we all solve if we just turned it off so the harder thing that's why but i'm not safe to stay safe
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:56.880]   He's your hard problem turn off the algorithm so but well his point roose's point is facebook is actually a dying company
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.520]   not because of political problems
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.080]   But because young people aren't interested
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.800]   Uh, he says he says tiktok is you know, it's or something like it's gonna take over
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.960]   It's my space. I would I would submit
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.280]   That if tiktok takes over we have not seen the worst yet
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.440]   That tiktok is so algorithmic and I love tiktok
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   But that's part of the problem. It's very very addictive. It's so algorithmic and so cleverly done algorithmically
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.320]   That it would be worse than facebook
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:33.360]   Musicals will solve the we won't know for some years yet, but I think roose, you know after after reading what he said
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.800]   I think you're right
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.360]   Kevin often gets things wrong, but in this case he might be right
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.440]   I I agree with you. I think tiktok's down right now
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.640]   I just try to go to tiktok is down on the web for some reason I did the same thing and it says too many concurrent
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.160]   Connections, I was I was gonna try to find a musical to solve so this is not our soul. This is not the same
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.480]   problem that
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   BGP problems DDoS
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:00.080]   Yeah, that looks like it that looks like either a DDoS or a misconfiguration. It does seem to be working on mobile
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.080]   So I'm not sure exactly what's going on
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.480]   Um wait tiktoks on the web hold up really? Yeah, you don't have a fax
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.800]   Here's a here's a nice tip. You don't even have to have an account to watch tiktoks
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   You could just go watch them in fact if you wanted to watch somebody who's about to have a million tiktok followers
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.720]   Like we watch we watch hank on the web. I just never thought about yeah
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.040]   He's on instagram too. In fact, he just told me he's gonna start a youtube channel, which I it's kind of a relief
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.680]   I was just wondering that today whether you're advising or he's advising himself to branch out
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:38.640]   I've been telling him for ages here that he should not be relying on one platform format is so different right? He has to wait
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.520]   Different tiktok youtube has shorts, which are basically there. It's their attempt to be tiktoks
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.600]   But I think he's I said shorts. He said no, I don't have to do shorts. I'm gonna do regular
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.040]   To I think that's great. I think he's right. You should never you should do an exciting cooking show
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.160]   Yeah, I yes, I think that's what the long term he you should never you should never
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.840]   Rely on a platform. You don't control whether it's facebook tiktok youtube sub stack medium
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.200]   Yeah
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:11.440]   That was you know always when we first were you know everybody said oh you should you know facebook at one point was really getting big
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.560]   Into podcasts and meet in video and you should just do it on facebook and I knew new
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:25.760]   New nor on youtube nor anywhere else. I mean we're everywhere you want us to be but I wouldn't be on any one platform and ultimately we need to control our own destiny
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.960]   So but I hope for thanks to that hank. I think tank. Well, you know, I think he's
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.400]   monetizing plan is he's gonna sell salt because his handle is salt underscore hank
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.720]   Why not and he says he's a perfect product. It's high profit. It doesn't go bad
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.640]   Then you don't have to worry about rodents. It's easy to ship. There's no restrictions
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.840]   Said you're brilliant sell salt already your brand
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.920]   Here you use it on the sidewalk in the winter. Yes. Yeah, he could do that
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.720]   It's so yeah sell road salt
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.360]   He wants to do we were talking this morning because I work out with him on the wednesday morning
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:05.440]   And he wants to do a halloween thing. I said you should do a roadkill recipe
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:14.560]   He said but and this was telling he said I can't I said go pick up for 10 to pick up some roadkill and cook it up
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.480]   He said no no they'll take it down. They'll take it out and you can lose your account for stuff like that
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:25.440]   TikTok is brutal. He knows people with million followers gone in 60 seconds boom
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:31.840]   And wow you and that's it. I'm telling you if you think facebook is bad and which I do
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:37.440]   TikTok is gonna be wrong. Yeah, it's gonna be worse. I wonder why it's down
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.440]   So facebook posted yesterday was there a moment because you used facebook was there
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.880]   Was there can you remember a moment when you turned on facebook or it on you?
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.480]   Yes
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:55.840]   When I realized I always felt bad after I went through it and and it really was and I was trying I kept hitting the chronological button
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.160]   I just wanted to see
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.680]   The reason I was on facebook and I think the reason I would except for you jeff
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.440]   But most people I think the reason they're on facebook is that's how they stay in touch
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.200]   That's how they see kids the grandkids pictures or that's how they see
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:16.960]   You know my high school sweetheart. I was following her that kind of thing and if I just seen that I wouldn't have felt bad every time I went there
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.520]   But all the other stuff
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.240]   I could it would I feel a pit nice and I said why am I using something that's making me feel bad
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.400]   Same thing happened to twitter
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:31.520]   Twitter made me feel like I was having a stroke because it is so fragmented. It's like I can't it's like what
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.960]   You have to stay on twitter all the time to understand what they're talking about
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.440]   Mm-hmm. Anyway, or you can just accept that you don't and move on. Yeah, I kind of got there to be a very zen experience
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.520]   It's zen. It's like I have no idea what they're saying. No
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.160]   It's like having dementia ahead of time
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.200]   I don't remember anything. I don't know. See I'll be good at dementia. I'll just be like
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:57.920]   Did I tell you about my dog? Nice. Yeah, just post a picture. Yeah, good. Okay. Was I yours? I'm before
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:04.240]   Let's take a break. Um, we can talk actually about the uh facebook router outage
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:11.120]   Uh because facebook of course is not telling us everything but they've told us a little bit more as of yesterday
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:18.320]   Uh, it's not a bgp error. It's kind of a bgp. It's kind of interesting and I know you like infrastructure
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.520]   So we can do we don't have to I already cut I shut those pages down and everything. Oh, okay. We don't
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:29.600]   We we'll talk about the pixel six instead that'll make everybody
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.640]   I'll make everybody happy our show today brought to you by
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.200]   Our crowd you said you were reading up on them. It's kind of Jeff. It's kind of an interesting
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.280]   Yeah, business their venture capitalists
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.600]   And of course the phrase venture capitalists use all the time kevin rose said this he said you should be an angel investor
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.720]   You've got deal flow. I said what the hell's that he says you can see you know what's happening
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.840]   And so this is the thing if you've wanted to invest in pre IPO startups
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.880]   You know you're buying a stock is no big deal, but if you want to invest to start up
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:06.000]   Early before they have the exit of course. That's when you make the most money is when you you get in early
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.480]   That's how kevin made all his money you get in early and then you get the exit the IPO
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.720]   You need deal flow. The problem is you and me. We're just you know
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.280]   Doing our thing. Where do you get deal flow?
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:24.000]   That's what our crowds about these guys are venture capitalists guys and gals who are doing constantly doing the research
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.120]   They have deal flow because they're constantly investing they have both individual investments and they have a fun
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.200]   We'll talk about that in a second
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.000]   And because they have deal flow they can introduce you
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.480]   to new companies starting up pre IPO pre exit get in at the ground floor
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:46.000]   Now i'm going to tell you that there's a limit on this you have to be an accredited investor
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.200]   This is this is due to the laws in various countries
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.600]   I think they think they're to protect innocent people from investing and stuff they don't understand
[00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:00.080]   So if you go and you can find out right now if you qualify at our crowd.com/twig
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.440]   Depending on which country you'll see what the rules are for being an accredited investor
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.080]   But once you're an accredited investor and by the way, there's no cost to this you don't have to put any money in
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.200]   You can actually see what's going on
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.120]   You can see because our crowd is analyzing companies across the global
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.000]   It's not just us global private market
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.160]   Selecting those are the greatest growth potential and then they present them to you
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.120]   So you get deal flow from personalized medicine to cybersecurity or robotics
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.800]   It's a great way to just see what's going on in the world in quantum computing
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   In state of the art labs startup garages and anywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.640]   So that you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest early on
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.640]   Our crowds accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.480]   Many of their members they've already had 46 ipos or exits
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:01.360]   So that's a lot of people who have benefited a lot from these ipo and exits and you can see some of these
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.120]   On the page at our crowd.com/twig
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.000]   This is for somebody who's already doing all the right things you're saving up for your retirement
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.880]   You know, and you know, you're doing the right conservative things
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.680]   But if you have some space in your portfolio, you really want to diversify it
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.560]   And invest in early and innovative private market companies. This is really the only reasonable way you can do it at our crowd
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:32.080]   Accredited investors could participate in single company deals. Let me give you the deeds for as little as $10,000
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.320]   You can actually if you prefer you can buy into one of our crowds funds
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.120]   That's a little more expensive. That's $50,000
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.480]   But a minimum of 10,000 is required to invest. I want you to know that

[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:57.040]   It is I just signed up because you know, I've I've done a little bit of time and call it mid what I do in angel investing is little
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.240]   Cruce
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.960]   Um because it's the angels on the head of the pin. Well, what I what I have is about the size of a head of a pin
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.360]   Um, but with a couple of friends with things and I haven't done very well
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.880]   And so what's what's but I would love to stay involved in the startup world
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.720]   What's interesting about this is that they have not only the individual companies, but also their fund
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.080]   Yes, and they are very experienced investors
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.920]   So, I mean they know I mean they take the meetings with all these companies
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.040]   You're only seeing the stuff that they they've they've gone through hundreds of companies
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.760]   You're only seeing the stuff that they've looked at and they've taken the meetings
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.520]   They've done the thing a normal vc would do or angel investor would do and then they present you as if you're you know
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.400]   In the room you present you with that information. It's very interesting
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.880]   At first I was like, oh, I don't know this
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.560]   You gotta be richy rich. This is uh, but I you know, I trust our audience. All right, it's knows what they're doing
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.080]   Uh, and they have you know, there's no I'm not gonna take a lot of money in this
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.720]   No, well, you gotta put at least 10,000 by but yeah, right if you've already
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.440]   Especially you and me were you know, we're we've been saving. We're at that age
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.880]   And you know, maybe have a little just the kids are finally out of college
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.680]   Well
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.680]   Oh, you still have one
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.520]   I'll tell you what oh, yeah graduate school. Abby's doing a master's program. That's all
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.120]   It's a lot less expensive than the four what she doing master's it
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.280]   um
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   Let me ask. Uh oh
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.000]   It's a kind of writing. I think it's I
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.520]   Is it essay writing? It's writing of some kind some masters in writing
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.600]   uh, but it's um one of these modern programs at um
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.680]   Dominican where
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.560]   Uh
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.560]   You're off site for a lot of it and then they're like I think quarterly you go in
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.920]   It's really cool. They have a lot nowadays boy. You can do a lot
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.640]   With the zoom and stuff with this stuff learning is this a story. Yeah, are you still teaching classes on zoom?
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.880]   No, well, yeah one class which is international they can't get here
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.320]   Right, but we have news innovation leadership. But most of the other ones are in person
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.600]   I engage with journals and classes in in session with masks
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.760]   Yeah
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.280]   Yeah, New York is uh is in pretty good shape. I hear broad ways reopened
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.200]   Which is nice
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.560]   Still be a little nervous about gold nerve racket. Yeah, it's
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.400]   Yeah, we the concert we went to we were talking about before the show with the uh elana's morsel was outside
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.040]   At least and I are not comfortable with going to inside
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.760]   Events of any kind at this point
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.480]   Even we even we go eat out. We we throw we eat outside. We don't need sign. Yeah
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.560]   All right
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.280]   There is a big leak uh these leaks google just does have no success
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.880]   Maybe maybe that's their strategy. Maybe they're just like, you know what? We're not the apple
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.360]   It's just let it out. I kind of thought it might be actually
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.320]   uh a german retailer
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.960]   Has uh accidentally leaked out
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:49.600]   Um the price let me see if I can find this I had it before the price and availability
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.920]   We know the event the officials invitations have gone out the event will be the 19th
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.880]   Jason howl and I will be covering it. That's a tuesday
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.840]   So we will be um 10 a.m
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.800]   So uh, we'll be in here right before mac break weekly. I i'm hoping google can do it watching
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.480]   Yeah, it'll be it'll be fun. I'm very excited
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:14.400]   I actually had an order in for microsoft's folding phone the duo the duo they call it
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.760]   And uh, I thought you know, i'm gonna cancel that and because i'm gonna I know i'm gonna get a pixel six
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.280]   I mean, I just know it
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   What are you gonna get a pixel fold? Is that really gonna come out? You think? Well, I don't know that's interesting, isn't it?
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.040]   I already have the z flip which I like by the way
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.120]   That is a folding phone that makes sense because it's a little thing
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.400]   That's the clamshell ones. Yeah, and then it opens up and it's a normal size phone in every respect. I love this phone
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.160]   That's part of my promise. I have 20 phones now. I don't want I uh
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.000]   But I can't wait to hear
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.600]   Jesus on the 20th if I should get the pixel six or if I should get the folding flip them
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.080]   Well, I don't know i'm my guess is they're not gonna announce that that that's coming
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.800]   We I mean there've been enough leaks that we know they're doing it
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.800]   No, I met the Samsung phone. Oh, I love the I so well you can look at the pixel so the
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.160]   Camera on the Samsung is good not as good as the top of the line Samsung phones
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.400]   I'm a terrible photographer. Okay, so if you don't say I think it's still a very good camera
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.480]   Even though aunt doesn't like the white girl. They're all
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:24.640]   Well, not the aunt standards. They're all very good humans most of them are pretty good. The flagships are rustling pretty good. Yeah
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.320]   So, um, yeah, that's a good question actually. I'm not sure where I'd go on that
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.280]   Here's the german retail
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.320]   Uh, this one even comes with a free pair of bows premium headphones
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:46.640]   Yeah, this is from a german retailer saturn pixel six costs a huge
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:53.200]   649 euros launch october 28th so the events of the 19th that would make sense
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.440]   That you could pre-order on the 19th delivery on the 28th. They're also offering this can't be right
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.040]   a pair of
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.840]   269 euro bows headphones when you pre-order between the 19th and the 27th
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:13.440]   So but so big retailer probably not inaccurate. Here's the you'll have to read the German for us. Yeah
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.360]   Google picks a six vobishtelen vobishtelen means pre-order pre-order
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.760]   649 euros the dual leaf from the 18th to 27th, right? So it's it is limited time
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.640]   Yeah, let me let me make this big. I'm gonna make this big for you as big as I can
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:36.320]   dual camera 50 megapixels plus 12 megapixels. I can read that
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.240]   Oont eight megapixels front camera wonder what a front camera is
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:52.080]   8 gig ram and 128 gig internal spiker is 46 20 milliamp hours
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.160]   It's got a finger druk finger abdruk sends or
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.880]   Yeah in the gazish
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.080]   gazish
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.680]   Kind of face recognition
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.280]   Ah both both face recognition both face recognition and fingerprint. That's a really good price
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.400]   Oh, so you're getting a bows like over the year headset. Yeah
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.760]   Oh, that's weird. Oh, this does not look like a mistake. I mean this doesn't look like they will mock up. This is real
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.800]   I would say that trade-ins
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.160]   Google will for sure
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.240]   full ht plus display
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.880]   You're gonna have to do some math here
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.000]   6.4 inches. That's that's pretty good
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.200]   pretty big phone
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.600]   But what is 649 euros? How much money is that?
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.200]   750 bucks out of sync says in our chatroom
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.960]   so
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.440]   That's how that's actually if that's the price that is uh, that's good
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.800]   You know, they what was the price? I'm so sorry 750 750. Oh, I would pay that
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.160]   Yeah
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.560]   That's half literally half
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.080]   What the fold two costs actually though, it's only a
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.760]   250 bucks. I think the flip phone is a 1100
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   so
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.640]   Good I will this is with the streaming that the google chip, right?
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.320]   Yeah, I think that's why I ended up thinking I'm not gonna you
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.600]   I'm not going to use this microsoft phone because the google phone is just more interesting
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.960]   You know, it's a better android experience android 12 did come out this week, but not for the pixels
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.440]   Which is very I swear my my pixel 4 excel. It's just been weird and out here
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.080]   Recently the pixel launcher just
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.640]   Freezes. Oh have to go ahead and make it ready. Let me restart it. You're ready
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.000]   Oh, you're just doing this right on time google. I see what you're doing according to
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.720]   How I feel about my three or my three or whatever the heck it is google
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:59.040]   Not only confirmed the date rumors very started about what other devices the company will announce this is from notebook check
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.760]   uh according to apple
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.080]   The 257 on the twitter google. I don't know who they are google may be planning a
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.800]   bumper launch event with lots of things
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.560]   Maybe a pixel fold pixel watch
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.040]   They have a smart home event on the 21st. Oh
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.560]   So they would save then probably the new nest speakers for that, right?
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.720]   That'd be my guess. I mean they've announced
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.280]   Like basically that whole week is like all google devices all the time is kind of how I'm feeling it's going to be
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.320]   So the tab is interesting to me. Yeah, the pixel true a tablet next at seven
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.760]   Oh boy, that would be great. Wouldn't it would but do people want android tablets?
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:51.200]   Lenovo just had a tablet come out and um, there was one other one
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.200]   Wasn't android is notoriously bad at tablets unfortunately my mom loved her android tablets
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.320]   I know Jeff and I love the seven i love my love their side. I love the nexus and I enjoyed the chrome tablet makes no sense
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.840]   Yeah, why oh, yeah, yeah, crawl town. No
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.960]   Other rumors say google scheduled that fold release well after this month
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.320]   So it might not be right away
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:23.520]   I have to say stacy. I really get the idea of having it a handkerchief pocket handkerchief size phone that opens up to an
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.960]   Yeah, that really works. It's a great experience
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.920]   And it's holding up well
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.640]   Yeah, i'm not using it all the time, but yeah, it's going to hold up. I think they've they've they've gotten pretty good at the folding screens
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.360]   It's well protected when you fold it up get a case
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.440]   Uh, they sell a case that then hides the gap and all that
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.960]   Uh, you start wreck it? No, it's not like
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:54.160]   When you're scrolling does the does the bump you can feel it you see it, but it doesn't bother you
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.800]   I don't think i'm gonna get a callus from going through twitter
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.640]   No, the bigger issue to me is these folding screens aren't they don't feel like glass
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:09.120]   They're a little softer. So it's a little bit less of a glassy feel last year's was real
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.440]   I didn't like this year. They've gotten better at it. They're putting a layer of glass on top of it
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   So I think it's pretty good
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.160]   All right, anyway, yeah, well if you want to join us for that event you can
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.200]   We'd love to have you going

[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.960]   Anybody wants to join us, please we'd love to have you
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.720]   It'll be for sure Jason and I will be here and all three of you. Why not we can have fun be party
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.320]   stacking
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.960]   Avatars we could do that. We've never tried though. Can we do that, John?
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:55.200]   All takes his money he says
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.600]   Got the avatar of god. I love you. I do the crag spot
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.240]   We could put you get Jeff if you want to be in the dot you could be
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.840]   I think Stacy should be in the dot. She should be in the dot go. Oh, yes. Oh
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.040]   Um, you put in all these stories. I'm gonna let you uh talk about him
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.640]   Well, I wanted to hear you see if you could explain mirror to me
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.440]   Decentralized mirror
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.800]   Is this something to pay attention to it's a publishing platform
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.680]   A decentralized publishing protocol
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.360]   Um, okay
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.800]   It's on it's apparently on the blockchain
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.520]   Yes
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:42.800]   Is it this morning blockchain isn't automatically bad you guys? No, no, I I understand the point of blockchain
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.320]   It seems like that's less to you. It's more like Jeff like seems like over
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.720]   Overcomplicate
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.000]   When you use mirror you log in with your ethereum wallet. You got one of those right? Yeah, I do
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.880]   Oh god, some of us do guys away at a me cool kids got them
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.480]   You don't use it as with that or password to use your wallet
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.000]   That's kind of interesting
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.880]   And you're which means your account is owned by you and lives on an open blockchain instead of a centralized database
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.440]   All data published on mirror is cryptographically signed by users
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.280]   And stored on permanent decentralized storage
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.080]   Okay, so there is a server
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.760]   Are we've well decentralized storage. What does that mean?
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.480]   I mean, that's what i'm trying to get to understand here
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:32.880]   Well in theory the blockchain some stuff you can't you wouldn't want to put whole blog posts on the blockchain that seems
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:39.040]   Let's see here is people people have whole mechanisms for storing chunks of data in different like yeah
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.560]   Let me be ipfs. Yeah, that's the idea of ipfs
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.840]   Are we they are we've stored data permanently store documents and this is interesting
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.160]   It's a collectively owned a hard drive might be ipfs that never forgets
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.040]   Welcome to the perma web
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.440]   Hmm
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.160]   So this is where you're your data will be stored
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.080]   I guess if you if you're using our weave you'd probably have to participate, right? You'd want to
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.600]   Give some of your this actually sounds really interesting Jeff
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.400]   And there's stuff in their friend of t's
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:22.640]   Hosting the computer right in yeah, it natively supports new crypto native business models around tokens and nft's for instance
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:28.000]   Posts on mirror can be minted as entry editions allowing them to be collectible
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.120]   Collect my blog posts. Does it pay you for like
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.320]   Taking like some of your computer storage. I'm gonna assume becomes part of the like the distributed storage. Do you get like tokens for that?
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.360]   I don't know
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.880]   Because that's that's a really like
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.920]   I mean, I've I've been high on decentralization for you know a decade in with some of these
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.920]   blockchains
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.560]   In token like cryptocurrencies it is actually incentivizing people to maintain
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.880]   Consistent records over time right because a big issue is like you might sign up and then you're like, ah screw this
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.120]   I'm not interested in it and then you take it offline, right?
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.080]   You don't care
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.520]   But if you have an economic incentive to like maintain it
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.600]   Which is what this can do if you have a token or something like that
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.040]   The nft feels a little silly, but that's just well
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:27.200]   Even more this seems like overkill for a blog post most of which are ephemera
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.560]   Hey
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   Bloc posts
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.720]   Granite for no actually seriously
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.640]   Your blog posts are real essays and should be preserved. I think they're not being preserved as well as they could be
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:47.520]   My blog posts on the other hand are ephemera. Yeah, same. I feel like we should just accept that everything is kind of ephemerate
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:54.720]   I mean think about it think about like all the yeah think of well, let's get real. Oh my god now depressed
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:02.320]   But no just think about I mean like look at how much culture we've lost over time and how haphazard the findings we have are
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.280]   And the it's it's pure hubris to think that our stuff is really gonna
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.840]   I mean, yes, we have Shakespeare, but I guarantee you a million other people were writing
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:18.160]   Maybe not a million but lots of other people were writing at that time frame and we've lost a lot of their pamphlets or they're not worthwhile
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.480]   So I mean
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   I don't know. I think this is cool
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.640]   For instance ant because it doesn't have to be blog posts could do is photographs this way you could do a photography blog
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.560]   And uh totally fine with that you can mint the entries
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.520]   Connect the revenue to a stream or auction
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.800]   I wonder what you can. Yes. It supports crowdfunding
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.200]   So you can rally the support of your audience
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.680]   Unmirror anyone can raise funds for an idea project using the crowd fun block
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:52.320]   You know what this is really interesting. Thank you. Oh, you also have token race. Have you heard about token race? What's that?
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   Wilson is written about
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.960]   So token race is a way that um
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.600]   I'm gonna completely blow if you look up friend Wilson and token race
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.800]   Uh, let's see
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.920]   It's a way your audience can chew can curate can choose what goes up. Yeah to create a token race
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.760]   Oh
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.960]   No wonder Fred's writing about this. It's mirror. I didn't know that
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.400]   Is his portfolio company? Okay, there we go
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:27.440]   So our portfolio company mirror has been using a game mechanic called the right race to onboard users the mirror service
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.200]   I'm very interested. Yeah
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.120]   You need a right token to publish on mirror. The best way to get is to join the right race that happens every wednesday
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.960]   Oh, we missed it five p.m. Eastern shoot shoot anyone who joins a
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.760]   Hardly dead. Yeah, if we had just been stopped yelling at each other, we could have tokens now
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.880]   Vote for new users in the right race top vote getters are airdropped a right token and can publish on mirror
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:59.280]   Fred got his right token a while ago. What a surprise
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.720]   Yeah, any any now publishes a mirror image of this blog on mirror
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.120]   Yesterday mirror announced they've expanded the game mechanic to any activity that requires a token
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.200]   They call it a token race imagine your dao don't know what that is wants to emit new members
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.960]   I had to look that up too, but needs a way to do that token race
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.880]   decentralized autonomous organization, that's me
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:31.360]   Imagine your dao wants to distribute funds to worthy crypto procta projects crypto race
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.000]   token race
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   It's like a crypto race
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.960]   So to create a token race user specifies the address of the erc 20 token contract to use
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.360]   Uploads a list. Oh, this is going to be very mass appeal uploads a list of proposals
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   I
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.160]   Am needing to vote on
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.000]   And specifies a minimum number of tokens members need to hold to be eligible to vote
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.040]   It's just like civil which is how the reason I have a theory it was because I I gave money to civil
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.760]   Which was this whole journal something built on the blockchain?
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:09.120]   wildly over complicated journalist heads exploded they didn't know what to do in a time
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.520]   Um, that's what I fear for this
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.960]   But there's let me ask you a question what distributed though for all the problems we were talking about earlier and all we don't want the huge
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.720]   property to be involved
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   Is a distributed thing though
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:28.400]   More vulnerable in the long run no, but so why not but it's less popular because it's so damn complicated
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.720]   So I'll use as my example mastodon, which is our federated twitter
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   Uh, it's just less popular because you have to figure it out
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.960]   And it's it's not it doesn't that doesn't need to be does it sort of because you have to find a server
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.200]   Join that server then the people you want to follow and other servers you have to understand that you're following them from there
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.280]   It's yeah, it's not immediately obvious. It's a little complicated and I think though we're getting to a point
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.360]   There's some services and that's why i'm excited about the crypto thing you can embed a lot of this in hardware
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   So imagine if you
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.560]   bought like
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.840]   Let's mastodon may not be a great example, but like you bought the gamers mastodon
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.960]   Server right you would it like in a box
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.600]   So basically or maybe you just bought a mastodon box and then you connected to certain
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.120]   Categories that you liked when you set up your box like I think
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.440]   People are becoming a more interested in buying hardware and maintaining it and so as part of that deal
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.640]   You are, you know
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.840]   Your own server. Yeah, contributing to the distributed network. I'm sure in the early days of the worldwide web
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.000]   We're a little confusing and complicated and of course you want to create user layers above
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.920]   You know, honestly a hardware wallet is basically what you were talking about with your personal blob
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:55.280]   Ages months ago on this show and I can imagine that your phone could contain have a hardware wallet or you'd have a separate device
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.000]   It's a hardware wallet that is your identity blob
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.480]   And it has it has everything has links to the blockchain where your personal stuff is stored things like that
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:08.800]   That you control access you could you know, I mean this is this is I agree
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.440]   Very interesting right now crazy complex
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:21.200]   Much more over this one token race supports voting on behalf of a multi-sig account without requiring multi-sig holders to sign their vote
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:27.840]   Using the multi-sig in order to vote on behalf of a multi-sig add your multi-sig address to the token race page once it's verified
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.400]   You'll be able to vote on behalf of the multi-sig
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.400]   So that's using your wallet me at it
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   Yeah
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.200]   But it's but it's but but it's interesting and Fred, you know, I listen to Fred Fred smart
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.640]   There's something here. I just can't call something. This is very very interesting to me
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.440]   Um, well I put it there. Yeah
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.760]   Yeah, I'm I'm definitely gonna figure the sentence and do it
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:01.440]   Yeah, I found a couple links and I'm gonna look at it some too. Yeah, yeah
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.840]   Especially since I already have wallets. Yeah, I see and you've posted what did you post there?
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.160]   You posted a token found among ether scan. Oh, okay, the token
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.240]   So it shows you all the information about the token and how many holders there are and stuff like that so people can research it
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.880]   If you want to read about this is dev.mirror.xyz
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.160]   or yeah
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:31.360]   Sorry, yeah, even though even the address is opaque you mean calm xyz.com. That's where I should go
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.320]   No, no, I've put it in our seat and I put it in our disc dev that mirror that xyz
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:43.280]   You mean calm? No, no, no xyz.com
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.880]   No
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:54.080]   I have a flash xyz. I have enough trouble explaining to people that my son's account is salt underscore hanger score they go. What's that?
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:01.360]   No, it's well too late now. I ain't gonna change it. Yeah, I can't change
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.600]   I don't think he regrets it. He's always you know, he's cool. He's ahead of me. Yeah, he's cool. He's way ahead of me
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:14.240]   A million followers in tiktok show us the way hank show us the way
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.080]   I love it. You should be doing him on the discord server
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:29.360]   Well, you you're right. He would absolutely love to be on it. I guess tiktok is back up now, huh? Yeah
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.000]   um
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.720]   All right, I I feel I feel like I'm
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.400]   Our rundown has taken on the
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.320]   Attributes of twitter now for me. I don't understand any of this. What's going on?
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.680]   That's something there. How I do my research every Google's coral AI kit does miss tacey have thoughts. Okay, let's look at it
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.680]   I don't know
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.920]   That was brought up this morning on floss weekly
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:00.160]   By what line is that? It's right after the uh, didn't it right after the mirror xyz
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.520]   Oh
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.040]   coral.ai
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.080]   Quick take you mean coral dot com they have
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.680]   got ai.com Jeff
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.640]   coral.ai
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.840]   Alexandra
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.000]   Toonie and coro.com
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.280]   Oh, I
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:29.120]   Are you stacey? Oh, it's hardware. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, it's just you know coral is their their
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.800]   AI compute board it they've had it for a while. So I'm just like what it what's new here. I
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.440]   Did see there's a risk had a new USB device new risk five board from intel out
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.640]   Which is interesting the fact that intel is making a risk five board is pretty interesting
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.880]   Although like and vidias had them for a long time they used them they built them to
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:57.600]   manage some of their processing on their massive big gpu's but like intel
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.480]   Usually poo poo's everything so i'm going to try it. Oh, they're right intel's probably terrified
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.840]   It's what's happening. I was gonna say they just trying to turn the party essentially
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.800]   It's risk five for those who haven't been following our
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:14.560]   Conversations about it is a new architecture open source micro architecture for processors
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.280]   Kind of like x86 would be or arm
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.360]   Um, it's it's it's risk so I bet it's arm-like. I don't know if it's related to arm
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.800]   It is it is it is a risk and the style instructions
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.520]   Yes, and intel's not exactly building fabs for this. They're putting on fpga's so
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.760]   Um, you know they can program with machines, but still the nios v processors the next generation
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.880]   Oh, so they're using it actually just like in vidias been using it
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.240]   So they're this this makes sense because you can cheaply optimize and control your fpgas with this
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.440]   Yeah, but you know, that's the first step, isn't it?
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.520]   It is and it's not like intel actually has to pay licensing fees. So you know beauty beauty part
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   It's free man open
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:03.040]   I I mean the hardest thing. Oh, I would guess there's like gpl style licensing for it
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.280]   If you use it you have you can't there's restrictions on how you can use it. I don't know
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:15.200]   I don't think there are restrictions on how you can use it a lot. I mean one of the challenges of using risk five is
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:22.000]   Most people are not chip designers like that's a pretty esoteric skill set right? So you usually go to like
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.560]   It's not is it sci-fi
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:32.000]   That's that's where no no no no that's silicon lips. Oh, um sci-fi. I think is like I there's so many sci companies. Mr. Huggy
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:40.400]   So, you know, he's good. He's cute anyway. Yes, I five. Okay, mr. Huggy said intel did an ip and fab deal with sci-labs
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.200]   for risk five
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.960]   I sci-fi is related sci-fi
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.480]   No, sci-fi is a company. They're a fabulous chip company
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.160]   They do compilers and they make it really easy for you to bring your ideas to risk five. They're kind of like a neat
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.000]   I don't know but intel was actually in talks to buy them. That was the big rumor
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.640]   Um, which would have been a big freaking deal
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.200]   Um, anyway, I don't know why we were talking about the sci-labs
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   British regulators getting involved
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:22.240]   Uh sitting out rules that I think might be a little challenging for tiktok snap and only fans
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.640]   They want age
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.240]   Verification
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.000]   admittedly end up with identity verification, which means you end up
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.960]   Screwing vulnerable people around anonymity. I don't think so you can still be you can still be anonymous on the web
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:44.800]   You do need to have we do need I know people are going to hate this and it just depends on how you
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.000]   Mandate it. You need to have a credible digital identity that is
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.920]   Not that is protected and that is attributed to you and that isn't like
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.880]   But it could just say your name
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:06.000]   Yeah, yeah, just say your say or just say your birthday and and verify that and I have the token
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.640]   And you can say you don't know my name or dress, but you do know my birthday is over a team and that kind of thing
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.680]   The problem is they also things with it. They also want to control hate speech
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:22.480]   Uh, they must add video streaming platforms harmful speech speech that is an harmful but this harmful
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.280]   Yeah, so when the government tells you it's it's legal, but harmful that it becomes de facto de jure
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:33.120]   Illegal right so the government said but they won't tell you what is harmful. It's just your ass. We know it when we see it
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   Video streaming platforms under the new regulation
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:44.640]   Must ask the age of users and take down harmful illegal content including hate speech and terrorism or face heavy
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.960]   Finds the uk media regulator
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.280]   off com o f com or have come
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.640]   Uh, you know somebody who'd be great to have on the network. I don't think you've had on before maybe you have jeff kasav
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.560]   No, let's get him so jeff wrote the 26 words that created the internet. Oh, yeah
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:03.200]   Yeah, great book definitive book on on 230 his next book, which is just coming out
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.360]   Which I blurbed is on anonymity and the need for anonymity and jeff's
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:10.160]   Law professor and brilliant at this stuff
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.960]   um
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.040]   Jason let's see if we get him on a twig
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.320]   KOS if
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.280]   A O s e f k o s e f ko s e f kasav
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.600]   The 26 words created the internet is a brilliant book
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:31.200]   It's really is they it explains the history of 230 and really well and and his anonymity book is good too
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.400]   And he defends the need for anonymity so that goes to the question stacy
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.720]   Is it possible to have an identity that is not?
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:42.080]   Um tied to you, but if you're gonna have verified age somehow it's tied to you
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.400]   So who do you trust to do that? You you end up in the death of anonymity spiral?
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:51.040]   I think you may remember that the original off com regulation required you to go to a bar
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.800]   Show him your idea
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:01.040]   Unless he's a born by the bar would then pass along. Yeah, he's he's good man. He's good
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:08.080]   Uh, the guidance does not according to analyst not put pressure on video platforms to roll out any major product changes
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:16.160]   Such as new age verification technology because off com admits consumers could just switch to services and corded outside the uk
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.560]   That's called an unintended consequence
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.360]   The regulator said it hopes to coordinate these requirements with counterparts in europe and elsewhere
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:29.520]   Here so there is a globally consistent regulatory framework in the future analyst said the
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.400]   Regulation and the guidelines were not meaningful
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:39.280]   And we're inherently set up to fail because they don't address the biggest player in the video video streaming industry youtube
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:43.760]   Which is not does not doesn't have the correct kind of off this original office in the uk
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.400]   There in ireland exactly right
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:49.440]   Uh plus this is also pre legislation
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.600]   So it's a weird thing to do where the regulator has decided to regulate without the laws behind it
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.760]   very odd
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.400]   Big well i'm gonna take a break and then we will talk about probably the biggest security story of the week in just a little bit
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.560]   Our show today brought to you by udacity and i am a fan
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.200]   udacity
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.560]   Uh was founded about 10 years ago. I think they just had their 10th anniversary. Congratulations udacity
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.640]   I joined them shortly thereafter
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:23.360]   We were talking about it on twig when they found it because they created the nano degree program and they did it first with google
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.560]   And the whole idea was Sebastian thren who was a google or at the time
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.280]   Uh who said, you know, we're we're getting people coming to google want a job. They've got computer science degrees
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.320]   They've got you know credentials up the wazoo, which is a very painful place to put your credentials
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.840]   And they still aren't the people we want to hire because they don't have the skills the basic skills
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:52.400]   So udacity was created and these nano degree programs are created to give people from any stripe any walk of life
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.480]   the skills they need to get the jobs that are
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.280]   demanding
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.880]   needing more people all the time at the biggest companies in the world
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.120]   Udacity is here to encourage your career growth. They they want to provide you they're built
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:14.640]   They were founded to provide you with information about the career you want to give you the skills for that career then help you even get the job
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.680]   They have unique content the latest cutting edge nano degree programs
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:26.160]   You cannot find anywhere else in amazing areas like flying car and autonomous flight engineer
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.160]   AI entered a self-driving cars machine learning engineer
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.800]   Robotic software engineer and more the top five nano degree programs
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.880]   Right now and and this shows you how kind of their their work you're working in the future
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:47.680]   Data engineering product manager data analyst data scientist and programming for data science with python
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.280]   Those are the top five right now, but there are many many many more programs
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.160]   We've seen some great success stories. Jobin said udacity is a quote art udacity army with skills to develop models
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.120]   And gave me an innovative experience with quick high quality recurring feedback
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:11.440]   Aaron said udacity's nano degree programs and career resource center played an integral part in helping me land a job offer from google
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.000]   right on erin
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.680]   Udacity's courses are created with the biggest companies like microsoft google ibm aws

[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.840]   The entirety of twitch has been leaked have good sponsors. I know don't we
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.320]   You do you do you ask me another credit one
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:31.040]   I think one of the reasons is we've been talking about udacity for a decade because it was the google connection and it's with this on this show we've been talking about
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:40.640]   This is bad. This is not a ransomware attack. This is not this is not you know some hackers trying to make money. They're not selling on the net
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   Today a user posted a
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.560]   125 gigabyte torrent link on forchan
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.280]   That basically contains
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.960]   everything
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:00.160]   Everything on twit the the poster said which I was sorry twitch. No, you don't get our source code. No way, man
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.400]   There isn't any twitches. There is no source code
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.760]   Amazon owns twitch
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:14.560]   Amazon AWS serves twitch. I'm gonna what does that mean all of twitch? I don't understand that
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:22.240]   Uh, you get the source code you get projects twitch hasn't announced that uh the code for those you get
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.080]   Uh how much money people are getting paid on twitch you are getting
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.320]   passwords although it looks like the passwords were salted
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.880]   And then and then encrypted would be crypt later, but apparently
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.200]   Well, somebody was looking at the code on twit
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.640]   Twitter, I'm so confusing twitch twitter twit
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.120]   Stop the incentive
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:51.920]   I was reading on twitter somebody's looking at the code saying you know the way they coded this you could use the salted hash as the password
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.080]   And we go yeah, come on in
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.800]   So, oh geez. Yeah, I know
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:03.760]   So normally you salt it so that it's a one-way process so you can compare the salted hash
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.760]   But the idea is that nobody has the password in the clear
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.400]   Well, anyway
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:17.920]   I don't know. Oh look change your if you have a twitch account. I do this immediately change your password turn on two factor for sure
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.960]   Uh twitch internally is aware of the breach according to one anonymous company source
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.080]   This is from video games chronicle.com
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.560]   And it's believed that data was obtained as recently as monday. This is not old stuff
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.920]   Single here. Yeah, this is on a ws. We don't know exactly, you know, we've seen breaches from
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.400]   Poorly protected s3 buckets things like that. Maybe that's what's going on. I don't know
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.880]   The posters imagine that twitch would have all their stuff in an unprotected s3. You think they'd be smart
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.440]   Twitches confirm the leak is authentic. We quote we can confirm a breach has taken place
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:59.680]   Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this will update the community as soon as additional information is available
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.240]   Thank you for bearing with us the entirety of twitch's source code their get
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:11.520]   Basically their get repository with commit history going back to its early beginnings. I would guess that's just some dot tv
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.760]   creator payout reports from 2019 actually they're 2019 through
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.120]   Uh, uh september 2021 gamers making six figures folks many
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:26.720]   Uh, you know the one I locked I liked uh chess masters making some good money
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.560]   Grandmasters like hikaro made I think $257,000
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:39.600]   Uh last year on uh, which is great because chess masters historically are kind of a thread bear bunch
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.120]   Uh, so i'm just glad i'm just glad to see this no sadoku. It's no sadoku
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.200]   It was just going to say how's your sadoku guy doing? I wonder he's probably doing big
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:58.560]   You get the mobile you get here's what you get all done at what you get with your 128 gigabyte download mobile desktop and console twitch clients
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.120]   proprietary sdk's
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.800]   And internal aws service is used by twitch
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.080]   Every other property that twitch owns including i gdb and curse forge
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.240]   And unreleased steam competitor twitch was working on code named vaper from amazon game studios
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.000]   twitch internal red teaming tools designed to approve security
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.640]   By having staff pretend to be hackers whoops
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.400]   Uh
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.520]   holy
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.400]   cow
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.440]   The poster the hacker posted saying quote
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:37.280]   The leak was intended to foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space because
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.760]   Their community is a disgusting toxic cesspool
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.960]   Or another one
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:51.360]   Uh unity code for a game called vape world which appears to be a chat software based on
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.560]   on vapor
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.080]   Popular streamers such as shroud nickmerks and dr lupo have earned millions
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.800]   More than 80 streamers have earned over a million dollars in the last
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:12.640]   Two years wow good for them. Yeah, nothing wrong with that. Although i've seen people say well, that's it
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.680]   I'm not giving them any more money. No, they earn it. It's fine
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.240]   81 twitch streamers have been paid more than a million dollars since august 2019
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:23.600]   Top of those list is crucial role
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:29.760]   Which is a team of voice actors who stream dungeons and dragons sessions now that's nerdy
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.480]   They've made get ready for this stand back

[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:52.480]   Overwatch player xqc o w or maybe that's xq cow counter strike platers
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:43:00.720]   Summit 1g fortnight. I think that meant they meant players summit 1g fortnight player to fui and phase
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.040]   clan co-owner nickmerks
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:09.520]   Here's twitch here's the list of twitch's highest paid streamers. We go on right now and look at one of these
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.920]   You want to see tim the tat man? Sure. I'm so

[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:34.880]   This content. I think I probably did it wrong. Oh, maybe they maybe they earned that money and left. I would
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.280]   I'd be like I no longer want to
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:44.720]   Yeah, oh, you know what I did it. I did it. I have two factors. So hold on a second. I have to authenticate
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:47.440]   Hold on. Hold on. Okay
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.480]   Okay, it wasn't by the way, I set up two factor and then it didn't work
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:58.000]   So let me see if it's working now. Yes, it is good. All right. So now
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.440]   search for any of
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:09.840]   Who was it again? Kind of forgot our critical force critical role. I think crucial role. Oh critical role. Sorry
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.320]   crucial role

[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.760]   I want it now

[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.600]   Tim the tat

[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.280]   I don't know what's going on. Maybe oh, because they're not live right now. That's why
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.080]   Well, they don't have tape something up
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.560]   Tapes, what are you we're talking about tapes?
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:09.440]   There's a lot of
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.760]   Tapes of it. I got to here we go critical role. This is
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.080]   This is uh, check out this chatting stream for six days ago
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.480]   Um
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.480]   If I want to see them playing a game

[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.680]   How do you make money on twitch you make money because people throw money at you getting commitments?
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.880]   Yeah, you gotta subscribe. I was say I was surprised my my daughter is now in a dnd club
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.480]   The dnv is super hot with the the kids right now
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.640]   Five bucks a month for critical roles. That's interest. I wish I'll pay that no. I'm not gonna pay that
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:56.320]   Anyway, that's how they got their millions. That's now. We know clearly, but you know what?
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.920]   I mean, we're not a five dollars a month. That's a lot. I mean, you don't know
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.080]   Hello hello twitch club
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.560]   Quit club come on come on club
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.480]   Brit club no these I mean some of these people are behind like a lot in
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.600]   I mean
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.080]   15-hour days. I mean I complain about being on for like almost three hours. No, they work for this
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.760]   Clearly I'm not cut out for this by the way three of the streamers on the list have confirmed to the bbc that the figures are accurate
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.880]   So this is uh
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.200]   This is this is this is the real deal
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.800]   Twitch is confirming it people are confirming the data
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   People are looking at the source code saying yes, it looks like the real deal
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.720]   Fortnite streamer bb g calc told bbc news the earnings. Let's got my figure 100 correct
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.200]   Wow
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.760]   Anyway, biggest biggest breach at least in terms of you know the impact
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.120]   To the real world in a way. I'm glad they weren't ransomed
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.600]   You know, I mean they're not they probably would have yeah gladly paid millions not to have that revealed
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.760]   But this feels kind of like the sony hack in the sense that it just feels like vengeance. Yeah
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:10.400]   Vengeance's mind say at the hacker
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:16.960]   So leo have you been following bad art friend considering that you have a tiny kidney you might need to make a friend
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:26.400]   Who's been our friend and our friend is the story of the new york times. Okay. Everybody's going nuts for right. Okay
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.560]   Is this where
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.560]   a woman went on
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.160]   Uh social media and said i'm going to give away my kidney to somebody
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.560]   I don't know just to do it because i want to be one. Oh
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.600]   And then people started
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.200]   Thinking that this was a little overdone and then a writer
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.480]   This is this is an unpublished writer and then a published writer came and wrote
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:53.200]   A story pulling pieces of the chat as part of that story. So now everybody's in her car fuffle
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.720]   All over creation about her and her kidney
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.680]   But I bring this up only because it's relevant to you with your
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.120]   They use doctors
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.320]   To find somebody who needed a kidney but wouldn't otherwise get one
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.320]   Right
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:11.600]   In fact, she eventually did meet him and she started posting
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.360]   Uh
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.040]   Celebrating her one-year kidney versary. I you know what the good news about my uh particular plight
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.200]   I cannot donate a kidney now so don't ask
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   I
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.800]   Have a shrunken kidney
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.760]   I don't know if it's not functioning or just less functioning or what they don't really tell you that
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.560]   They just say uh your kidneys kind of small
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.320]   I feel like you know, you are a lucky poster child for why not to do this
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.520]   This is uh, okay
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.240]   So i've i've been thinking about this because we talked about it
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.560]   We were talking about it as earlier a couple weeks ago
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.000]   I mentioned that I had done a full body scan open an MRI and it's like very detailed takes an hour
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.120]   a pain in the butt uh noisy, but it didn't scare I didn't wasn't claustrophobic so
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.480]   And then they come back to you with your pictures and they say well, here's the 20 things wrong with you
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.960]   And what I realized is of course first of all if you just look at your skin
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.160]   You know, there's things wrong with you on the outside, right? Everybody's got a flaw
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.120]   You know have an eye that turns in or whatever
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.160]   Um, but you don't know about the things that are wrong with you inside you just go along merely living your life
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.680]   Well now you know
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.720]   And you know none of it was life-threatening for me
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:28.320]   One of the things I learned I don't have heart disease. I don't have uh, making some ananiarism
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.960]   And then there is no cancers. So all of that is what I wanted. Hey, that's worth it. It would seem to be yeah
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.440]   But then you learn things like
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.880]   I don't even know what it means your spine ends at t2. I don't know what that means is that good. Is that bad? I don't know
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:46.560]   They say there's there's there's something on your liver that could make the your shoulder hurt
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:51.680]   No, actually what they say is it's probably nothing, but if your shoulder right shoulder hurts
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:54.320]   See a doctor and I know what what
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:00.640]   Because what's really weird is my right shoulder was hurting, but now it's all better. So I don't think it's related to the liver. All right
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.720]   It's more like lifting
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.120]   This weird little things like that. I have uh one of my uh, one of my mass joints is full
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.440]   I still laugh about that. No, I don't know what
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.160]   Look at the picture. You see it's full. You can see it's full. The other one's empty one's full one's empty
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.720]   So they said full of
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:28.240]   Fluent I guess but it could be tar. I don't know it looks like tar
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:34.320]   But they don't they say look uh, you should probably have this looked at how I don't know whether they put something in your ear
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.120]   I don't know
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.480]   You should have this looked at because if it got infected you get it a bad earache
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.640]   You could lose your hearing if it's really bad
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:43.680]   But it's been there probably my whole life right in a life
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:50.160]   So that's exact that with a CT scan. Yeah, so they could actually go see
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.840]   Yeah, I was gonna send that one to my doctor and then we'd give you anybody I can send one
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.560]   Go what would you do this again or not? Yeah, I'm gonna do it
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.680]   Now what I wish is I didn't when I was young because then you'd have a baseline of all the things that are wrong with me
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.920]   I don't know how long I've had a bad kidney
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:10.560]   But maybe it was this could be congenital. It's bad. It's not even bad. It's just a little smaller than the other smaller
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.400]   enemies but a normal kidney like 12 yes like being as it could be like that exactly
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:21.120]   So but now I have a baseline so if it gets any smaller
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:26.320]   That would be a concern. Oh no. No, wait a minute. See now you're setting yourself
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:30.560]   So no, I'm going back. They said you should come back. Of course they did every 18
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.520]   Yeah, yeah. Well, hello
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.560]   No, but I think this is good because I have a baseline to optimize
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.320]   Changes you'll know because you now know what's what it looks like you still don't know what it is
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:48.880]   I mean like your kidney might expand to 24 inches. Well, then I'd want to know that wouldn't I want to know that?
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.680]   I think I'd want to know what if they say like huh, that's weird or different we think but
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.040]   We don't know what it means and then you're like, oh, I keep
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:03.280]   Well, that's that's what you have to be prepared for is this knowledge that there is everybody had everybody's imperfect
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:08.480]   There are no there's no perfect human. So you're gonna find out about things that are imperfect. Are they bad?
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.480]   Well, if you have no symptoms, maybe not
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.080]   I found it what I really want to know no heart disease no cancers
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.760]   No aneurysm. That's important because that's something that could kill you like that
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.960]   So I wanted to know that
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.480]   And uh and the rest of it
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.560]   I'll just kind of live with the knowledge
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:28.560]   And then I do want to go in every couple of years just to make sure that nothing's changed
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.760]   I don't look it's expensive. That's the problem is 2,500 bucks
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.160]   And most people are not going to spend that kind of money, but I can afford it so I'm gonna do it
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:42.800]   They said no it may not be a problem, but I have been eyeballing a yacht. So make sure you come back
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:52.640]   So the the discord chat is going is fighting every perfect all the uh all the animated gifs
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:59.600]   It's so good. I'm so sorry. I I totally oversharing. I know I'm totally
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.440]   I'm totally oversharing there that one right there
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:06.640]   That's exactly what it looked like
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.560]   And the guys the guy is literally sitting on the screen while you're doing it
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:15.120]   And he says, you know because you'd have to do things like uh hold your breath
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:21.440]   For like, you know and and to get us to get a steady shot. And so he's saying he's saying oh, that's good
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.440]   That's a good one. Oh, that's nice
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.640]   Is that all the rest of that?
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.920]   What's wrong with that kidney? Well, never mind. We'll talk about that later
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:38.000]   No, they're very they were very professional. It was good. It's actually great and in theory. I have a
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.800]   A phone call they owe me with a doctor
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.440]   But I think what I'm just gonna do is give it to my doctor and say look doc if you think there's anything we should do something about it
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.680]   Then I'll do it, but otherwise keep this in your back
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.080]   On fire and one other person to pay in this scenario. So no
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.880]   I got I get medical insurance. Yeah
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:01.040]   No, I I think that I know people who
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.240]   You know have died suddenly from aneurysms my aunt did
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.360]   I know people who have gotten you know, found out they had cancer when it was at stage four
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.880]   Or stage five. So if you could find out at stage one would you want to know that?
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.000]   Yeah, and that's something considering
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.440]   Like this is the month of october and it's breast cancer awareness. Yeah with um
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.280]   uh
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.120]   COVID-19 a lot of the checkups didn't really happen
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:37.520]   And that's right people are catching this stuff. Yeah a little later than you would have normally caught it. So I'm I feel you on that
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.440]   Well, don't feel my kidney because it's a little small. No, I'm not gonna do it
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:47.760]   No, but it's good because now I would excuse if anybody says hey, I need a kidney. I'm so sorry
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.560]   I I need both one small. I got a diggy kid
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   I got a little one
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:00.880]   I can't I just do much. Don't like we get to do this. We're late. I'm so sorry. I apologize
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.200]   Nobody wants to know that or needs to know that
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:10.960]   I'm so sorry google isn't investing a billion dollars into africa including a new sub-seat cable
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:17.680]   So that africa will have faster internet. That's pretty cool. Well, let's just put this in perspective though
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.240]   Google just last week spent 2.1 billion dollars to buy a building in new york
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.120]   Well, you gotta have both. Yeah
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.920]   One billion for africa expensive yeah
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:39.040]   There should be more expensive the billion dollars will be spread over five years to support africa's digital transformation to cover a range of initiatives
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.320]   From improved connectivity to investment startups
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.640]   Nigeria Kenya Uganda Ghana
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.600]   You know, I have to say yes, it should you know, it's not enough other company should do it
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.880]   Maybe it should be more but we'll take everything we get yeah
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:03.440]   Africa has historically just been ignored plus what's happened there's fascinating is happening there the the the the Kenyan and Nigerian startup scenes are amazing
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:08.720]   Nigeria is becoming a major hub for new online fin tech
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:14.560]   There you go. I'm thinking I mean there's stuff to be learned a lot of stuff to be learned the sub-seat cable
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:20.720]   We'll cut across south africa Namibia Nigeria and st. Alina connecting africa in europe
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.080]   It'll provide 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve africa
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.880]   This will be this will lead according to the managing director for google in africa
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.080]   19
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.200]   Gajeria
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:39.760]   To a 21 reduction in internet prices and increased internet speed in Nigeria almost triple in south africa
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.480]   See google knows more internet's good for google
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.200]   Yeah, it's a nice virtuous
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:52.720]   Yeah, nice virtuous cycle. It's a projected to create about 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and south africa by 2025
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:57.120]   And there's a million dollars does go farther. It's a lot of money
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:02.560]   They've also launched the africa investment fund it'll invest 50 million in startups across the continent
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:08.960]   And they'll give them access to google employees networking technologies. That's exciting. I think that's great good for you
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.360]   google is also working with swedish engineers
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:17.120]   To build a carbon emissions tracker
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.120]   You're going to see I think over the next 10 years
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.760]   a lot of activity
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.800]   In climate change and carbon capture and yeah
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:32.400]   Do we want to talk about google sustainability event that was on tuesday? Oh, yes. Did you watch?
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.720]   I did watch
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.480]   So i'm going to give you an example of what I think is corporate
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.800]   BS
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.720]   Microsoft announced
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720]   their ocean mouse
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.320]   which is
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.160]   made from recycled ocean plastic and then if you look at the fine print
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.440]   Only 20 percent of the outer shell is made from recycled ocean plastic
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.960]   So there's a lot of plastic in that thing, but only one fifth of just the outside part
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.840]   Same thing with the iphone they say that crap every year. It drives me crazy. Yeah, they're
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.240]   It's lit service
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:14.400]   Well in dau just talked about building a are you ready for this a carbon neutral plastics plant
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.360]   What is it not going to use petroleum to make the plastic?
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:22.080]   Like like how do we make plastic everyone?
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:29.920]   It could make plastic with soybeans. You can make it with no without hydrocarbons. Yes in mushrooms. They are they are not doing that. Um
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:33.200]   So google has always said we're carbon neutral
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:38.720]   They have been since 2007. They want to be carbon free by 2030. I don't know if that means using
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:45.520]   carbon credits or actually being carbon free, but you know google those network centers use a lot of juice
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.760]   So what are they now?
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.560]   Proactively so what I was going to say also cool has been very proactive facebook as well
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.240]   at buying
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:58.400]   Renewable energy credits ahead of putting a data center somewhere to help
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:04.400]   Goose demand for renewable power in places they're going. So I think that's actually very proactive
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:13.120]   So they announced a couple things. I was most interested in the nest stuff because they're but okay, they they they did a deal where
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:21.360]   When you search for things on maps, they're going to show you the most eco-friendly way to get there. Oh, good. I'll do that
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:27.360]   So that's an option the the most fuel efficient route there. Also, if you're going to take public transportation
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.640]   They will show you the most like the de or the non diesel buses if there are electric buses
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.600]   When you're booking flights, you will be able to book flights based on
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.280]   carbon consumption
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:43.280]   So things like if you buy a first-class seat and they're doing at the seat level
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:48.720]   So if you were like I'm gonna buy a first-class seat you're gonna consume more carbon because you take up more space on the plate
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.520]   Um, so you'll get a notice about that
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:55.440]   I think that's kind of a little bit of lip service
[01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:00.320]   I think it's nice for people who like still believe in individual efforts for affecting climate change
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:06.000]   Um, so that's fine and you can you know, look up like eco-friendly hotels and stuff like that
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:13.040]   On the nest front, they're actually basically using their market power or the market power of anyone who signs up for this to buy
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:15.600]   renewable energy credits
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.640]   You'll pay $10 a month as part of this subscription so that I'm sorry
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:23.520]   I should tell you the free subscription the free option is
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.080]   they will
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:27.440]   let you
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:28.800]   use your
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.880]   energy consuming devices things that consume more energy at times when renewable energy is being produced
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:42.000]   Oh, that's so green. That's the green dots versus the black dots. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. This video is just brilliant
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.120]   Oh god, it's so adorable. It's really into everything's made of wood in the future or cork
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.080]   So that's good. Um
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.760]   So the extra feature is you pay and what they're going to do is they're going to aggregate all those payments to
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:02.880]   in areas to say hey, we're going to buy carbon renewable energy credits for these people
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.200]   and then that'll incentivize more construction of renewable power in that area
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:14.640]   Good. Um, you can actually do that through other places Kevin and I spent a lot of time trying to figure this all out
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:16.640]   because he already does that
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:23.600]   Um, and then there was a third thing that I don't remember. I'm sorry. We um, when we travel we buy um, uh,
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:30.720]   There's a lot of evidence that tree planning projects and others are not as good as they thought
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.680]   But when we travel we go to the good traveler when we fly and we buy carbon credits
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.600]   Uh, there and twit is buying now from terra pass
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:44.800]   Uh carbon credits for our business. It's because we want to be we want but again
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:48.880]   This doesn't mean you don't I mean we got a lot of lights and we use a lot of power and stuff
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.520]   The idea is you you buy credits
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.400]   Uh, it's actually surprisingly
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.120]   Uh inexpensive and they use those you give them money and they use those credits to
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.080]   Buy programs and this one's good terra pass
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:08.800]   They buy programs near you which is nice for things like land gas capture and clean energy from wind power and farm power
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.640]   This goes back to stacie's point where earlier i'm not bringing up the topic again, but but but the true cost of things
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.960]   And that's why carbon rate taxes. Yeah, and having a cost to causing the damage
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.640]   Uh
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:29.520]   We'll make more sense. Yeah, lisa and i love to travel. We know that you know planes and cruise ships are horrible polluters
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:34.720]   Um, and we don't like to exhale boat. Yeah, I wish I had an electric sail, but we do have
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.560]   You know, we generate all our power at home with solar panels
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.160]   Um
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.800]   But so we buy carbon credits which makes us feel a little bit better. I don't I don't want to do performative
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:51.680]   Sustainability and you're right stacey you raised the most important issue is is individual effort going to do anything
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:56.800]   We need governmental and uh, and corporate effort, you know, we need to change this close fixes globally
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:58.400]   but
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:03.840]   It makes us feel a little bit better and I guess it helps. I mean, yes, it keeps you from being as depressed in
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:10.080]   That's not so bad. Yeah, but also I think it does help. I hope it helps and we we decided a while ago
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:15.520]   We want to make it be carbon neutral. So we buy these that's terra pass. That's off to you. Yeah
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:21.520]   Um, it's you know, it's surprisingly inexpensive. It was a few hundred bucks per plane flight something like that. So
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.600]   Um, yeah, if people are interested terra pass.com
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:33.280]   Is the carbon credits for businesses and so forth and for travel? It's the good traveler and I got this from the Yale forestry department
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:38.640]   This is what they use. So I figure well if the Yale forestry school well, it's gotta be
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.240]   Okay, they only but they only plant ivy
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:45.280]   everywhere
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.800]   Um, it's cool. You enter in your flight in it. Yes. It also considers you know, uh
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:56.960]   Your uh, your first class costs and so forth and then it's not very expensive
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:59.120]   so
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   it's good and then
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:05.840]   They pay for carbon offsets, which I guess is like tree planting mostly but
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.600]   It was a big article on how tree planning is not
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.080]   The panacea that we would hope it to be
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:16.800]   Google engineers are helping a Swedish startup to build a carbon emissions tracker. I mentioned that
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:24.560]   Now I've said it again. So saying it twice is better, right? Let's move on at that age. Well, we forget what we've said I say earlier
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.520]   What did I tell you? I told you something
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.800]   Uh, oh yeah
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.440]   Uh
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.760]   Google's deep mind has made money
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:40.880]   If it's so smart
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:43.200]   Why did it make money sooner?
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.680]   first ever profit
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:49.120]   Because they can embed this AI stuff in commercial
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:55.040]   Products that lost half a billion pounds in 2019. I wish I could lose half a billion pounds
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.960]   I
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:00.800]   Think I've gained three pounds. It's the first sign that google's huge investment
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.080]   The research outfit is starting to pay off according to the financial times
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.120]   46 million pound pre-tax profit
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:17.280]   Nice entirely revenues derived entirely from applying its technology to commercial alphabet projects. Oh, it's even in house
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.640]   So it's just moving money around I guess
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.680]   Google is as you mentioned updating maps search
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.560]   and other products to help you save energy
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.560]   Uh
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.040]   Traffic light efficiency. You want to talk about that Stacey?
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.240]   Oh, that's their other sustainable thing. You're right
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:41.840]   Um, basically it's AI to figure out how to keep people idling less at traffic lights to produce fewer emissions and I don't know
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.480]   A slick. I'm not a
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:48.240]   Fluffy. I had a car that when you were stopped would turn its engine off
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:51.440]   A lot of cars do that. Yeah, the high-risk stuff
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:55.760]   Yeah, my outie did and the reason I found out was because New York City. That's the law, right?
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.440]   Jeff you if you're at a light you're supposed to turn off your car. No, no, yes, there's the law
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:04.400]   No
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.560]   No
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:11.040]   Maybe they need to tell more people to be sick get off the green so fast
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:15.600]   Maybe they need to tell more people about this law
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:19.040]   You're not supposed to idle you're not supposed to stop on the parking an idle
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:24.160]   Oh, but not lights. Okay. No, not lights. Okay. No person
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:31.040]   Shall allow the engine of a car to idle for longer than three minutes while parking standing or stopping
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.680]   Well, that means you're the sound like a traffic light
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.200]   Traffic lights are quicker this time. We're faster this time and we don't we don't waste three minutes in a traffic light. Well, wait
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:46.960]   There's more wait. There's more in addition the legal idling time is reduced from three minutes to one minute around public and private school facilities
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.360]   So if you don't often stop, right? Yeah, you can't idle there when you send the car service to pick up
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.920]   Right Percy little Jimmy. Yeah
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:03.920]   Okay, yeah, so it's not just it's not stoplights. It's just you can't
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.960]   Lio driving in New York. I thought I was supposed to turn off my engine. They're all re-ending me
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.440]   No, but the nice thing is that car anyway
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:15.440]   It would and they see put your foot on the pedal it would start up and it didn't seem like it
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:20.480]   You know it was a big deal. I even though it's always big deal to New York. There's good lord. Oh, I know
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:23.200]   Second that light turns green. They're like
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.640]   Yeah
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:30.240]   Yeah, that's what we should be without places to go. We got things to do and these tourists are always walking slow in front of us
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:34.000]   That it pisses us off. Oh, please. Oh, please. That's not tourists. That's New Yorkers
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.580]   God you can spot any of your
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:41.440]   Anywhere else in the country because they're like you're at a stoplight or a crosswalk and they're like halfway in the middle like ready to frog
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.360]   Out there. Yeah, I love it. I love it. I want to say it is the tourists are the ones who walk and drive slowly in front of us
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:52.320]   We need in the words of Fran Leibowitz pretend it's a city
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:57.120]   Have you watched that yet?
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:04.000]   Oh, god, you got to watch that. It's so funny. She was for she was so funny. Isn't she? It's on the Netflix
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.800]   Just watch billions. All right. We're gonna. Oh
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:09.920]   What do you think are you are you disappointed?
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:17.360]   We got no spoilers. No spoilers least there was no one was yanked up by a
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:20.320]   Construction crane
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.320]   What movie was that?
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:26.000]   That was a reference to an earlier show in which the certain character appeared. Oh
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.480]   Okay, I have to rewatch
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:36.880]   Let's let Damien Lewis. Oh Damien Lewis. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:39.440]   Showtime is now a kind of
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:46.400]   Person actually it's when you watch billions is kind of sad because Damien's wife was dying in the process of this these final few episodes
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.400]   And so it's very sad
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:49.840]   um
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:52.320]   But he like what a trooper man, you know
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:59.440]   Great actor. Oh get ready because that two-step verification we mentioned before that google's turning on here it comes
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:04.560]   They're turning on this is going to be fun. I can't wait to do the radio show that weekend
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.760]   Uh by the end of the year a hundred fifty. Oh my god
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.560]   Google is going to start enabling two-factor authentication
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:23.600]   Uh this month is cybersecurity awareness month today google provided an update on its account effort to two step verification efforts
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.800]   right now google says
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:32.880]   I you know it's not clear what this means we are enrolling
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.200]   Uh, we're enrolling people who have
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:44.400]   That's very okay, and we're connecting to your east watt out. Yeah, okay
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:48.240]   Uh
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:55.360]   We recognize that today's two sv they call it two sv which drives me crazy two step verification
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.040]   Instead of
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:02.480]   Mfa or two f a which everybody else called it are not aren't suitable for everyone
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:08.640]   So we're working on technologies that provide a convenient secure authentication what experience mpa Alexandria
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:11.520]   Uh, why can't I get into my google?
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:16.080]   Two step I used to stand up with crab ball. I was quite a two step
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:21.440]   It reduced the reliance on passwords in the long term right now. We're auto enrolling
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.520]   This is what I was trying to get to right now
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.480]   We are auto enrolling google accounts that have the proper backup mechanisms in place
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.600]   If you own a google camera phone
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.560]   To make a seamless transition to two factor
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:38.000]   To make sure oh you can do the security checkup if you want to see
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.560]   As part of our security work, we led the invention of security keys. Oh, please google
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.920]   Oh, that is taking a little too much credit
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:50.880]   Another form of authentication
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.680]   Ubeke was around before you got involved and all this that requires you to tap your key during suspicious sign-in attempts what
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:00.960]   wait a minute
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:05.600]   Of requires you to tap your key during suspicious sign-in attempts
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:11.760]   Oh, yeah, the little notification it pops up on your phone every once in a while. You got to tap your key
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:18.240]   What if I if I try to log in your physical key, that's crazy. This is poorly written
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.240]   We know security keys provide the highest degree of sign-in security possible
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.040]   That's why we've partnered with organizations to provide free security keys
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:33.200]   Oh, don't get your hopes up to over 10,000 high risk users this year something like this is the ubeke
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:38.000]   Oh, okay the ubeke's yeah, that's what I use. Yeah, okay to make security keys more accessible
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.760]   We build the capability right into android phones and our google smart lock app on apple devices
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.480]   So it'll use the uh already built-in fingerprint or face id
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:55.760]   To to be the second factor today over two billion devices around the world automatically support the strongest most convenience
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:58.240]   convenient to sp technology available
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:00.160]   so
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:03.840]   It's the end of this year, but I don't it's not by the end of 2021
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:09.760]   We plan to auto and roll an additional 150 million google users and
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.840]   require two million youtube creators to turn it on
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:17.680]   Does this I don't remember if it specified
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:23.040]   Um using sms in there because no this is not sms no
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]   Is that that would be my
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.960]   No, no, no regular people would try to
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.280]   Find an ease away out of this and yeah, no, they're not going to check email
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:38.160]   Yeah, no, no, I think well there might be a fall back to email or sms
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.720]   That's a good point, but this is intended to use devices you already have somehow
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.800]   I hope it's not you're right and that would be not a good
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:53.520]   I guess it's better than nothing. It's better than nothing, but it's still going to be a problem down there. Yeah
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.680]   Uh, you must have put this in who put this in who youtube is looking to hire its first executive
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.400]   You do this to taunt me. I do
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:08.240]   YouTube looks to hire its first executive focus on it and also on podcasts
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:14.640]   The video site is looking for someone to manage the growing number of podcasts uploaded every day
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.120]   What does that even mean?
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:20.560]   Yeah, I didn't know I thought you might is it foreshadowing to more
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:28.000]   exclusive to youtube content similar to what spotify is doing somebody got a fill in lucas Shaw the author of this on bloomberg because
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.080]   He says youtube is already one of the top-dash nations for podcast listeners
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:37.520]   The joe rogan experience one of the biggest podcasts in the world has more than 11 million subscribers on youtube
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:41.280]   Yeah, but not the podcast because it's a spotify exclusive
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.800]   Okay
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.560]   Podcasting is a small business relative to online video
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:58.160]   YouTube generated almost 20 billion dollars in advertising sales last year while the entire podcasting business didn't even top a billion dollars
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:03.680]   You got half of that. I don't know if that's an accurate number
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.480]   But podcasting advertised sales are expected to double this year good news
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:11.360]   Who who's that's good?
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:17.120]   Many of google's competitors compete for spot podcast listeners spotify amazon apple
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.920]   Yeah, I don't know what this means exactly because I don't think a youtube video is a podcast is it?
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:32.240]   We upload our podcast as a youtube video. Yeah, but then it becomes a youtube video, right? Right
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:38.880]   Could we pull a youtube video and turn it into a podcast? What it's a netcast
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:43.760]   Have we done the change log cat? Oh
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:46.560]   You want to go home, don't you
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:53.920]   Know I'm just like where are we in this rundown? Oh my god, you know what people keep sticking stuff in here
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.080]   That's the problem. That's the problem. It started. There was a
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.280]   Stories now. There's like 120. It's an algorithm. Did it the only one
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:06.720]   Stories here how there's 50 stories and he hates it
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:13.120]   You know on Tuesday. I literally went through the Mac break weekly rundown and took up like half of it out
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:18.240]   I I meant to do that today, but I didn't do this here. I put stuff in there and you can put it in
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.320]   But you put it in I probably take it out you put it back in
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.160]   No, I don't
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:24.160]   That was need of you
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.440]   I know this is not a democracy and you are the dictator
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:28.480]   All right
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:34.240]   I throw I throw offerings to the altar if that's you know, I appreciate that because that's great
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.120]   That's great. But the problem is I don't really have time
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:43.520]   Between you doing that and going to this show to go through this and call it and put it in order and all that
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.120]   Stuff I can put asterisk next to mine. So no, no, it's fine. I just apologize
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.600]   No, I'm just apologizing for my ineptness. No, no, no, that here. We are two hours in
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.080]   It's practically midnight
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.600]   Stacey's passing out from lack of waffles and and we haven't even done the change look
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:06.640]   So that's I just me saying I'm a bad bad man. I'm a bad host. Let's let's play the Google things interested
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.240]   No, I'm just I'm going down the list. I'm too tired to be interested. It's time for
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.680]   The Google change log
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:21.600]   Well, we crossed this one out here did this Google updating maps to help assume consumers say vengie
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:24.960]   How about this the october security patch is rolling out?
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:29.680]   You know, I don't think that's true because I just checked and I didn't have it. Oh, but I'm on 12
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:32.320]   So this is for 11. So keep your eye on it
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:39.920]   Uh, we also did the two-factor authentication throw that one out google abandons plans to offer bank accounts to users
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:43.200]   Well, never mind
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.120]   You know who's offering bank accounts to users now the us postal service
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:50.880]   It should have been doing that years ago. I don't trust a joy to do it
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:56.800]   They want it's not exactly bank accounts, but you can cast checks there and paychecks and stuff like that. They're
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:06.000]   Interesting. So the former google president who oversaw the project has begun his own fin tech company hiring away his staff from google
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.440]   They were gonna work with they were basically that's what uh
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.640]   People say apple should do they're so close
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:15.280]   Already with the apple card
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:18.400]   google analysis two years ago, but uh
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.240]   But if you watch billions, you know, you open a bank and you open a bank
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:27.280]   And you can't take that marijuana money can't take that marijuana married you want him money
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.960]   I feel like he shouldn't really be liable for that
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:35.760]   Yeah, I agree. I agree. Well, by the way, chuck should have long
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.760]   Been forced to have to recuse himself because of his wife's I know
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.400]   This show doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense. No, no, it's still fun
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:51.840]   Yeah, youtube music is gonna offer a free background listening in Canada. I have no idea what this means
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:54.480]   I didn't put this here. I don't know what this is
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.480]   Uh, so apparently
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:58.160]   Uh
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:00.080]   You could have it as a waiting room now
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:04.880]   You couldn't listen in the music in the background while you were doing other things on the phone or the screen is off
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.000]   I didn't know that that's a real limitation. That's terrible
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.040]   You could do it on Spotify apple music. Everybody else let's you do that
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.400]   So apparently it couldn't uh on youtube music
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:19.920]   But now that's starting November 3rd in Canada you'll be able to and maybe that will extend
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.560]   Oh, I see it's free users. So premium users
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:31.840]   Will be uh, we're able to do it and i'm a premium user. That's why I didn't notice it. Of course you are. Yeah, well, no
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.840]   I may you know what what do you want?
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.800]   Don't you don't engage don't even don't even participate. Oh feed me. Yeah
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:48.400]   To feed the troll google nest cam floodlight a new $99 indoor camera available starting today
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:55.120]   Do you like these stacey? I'm I have nest cameras and uh outside. I wouldn't put them inside, but I'm outside
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:57.440]   I
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.720]   I remember I tried the the new fancy outdoor indoor outdoor camera battery. Yeah
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:08.320]   The the software on this is really frustrating because it's now the google home software
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:11.360]   So like when you go from a notification
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:14.160]   Sometimes you get the his like sometimes you can see it
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:20.160]   But sometimes you just go straight to your home page and then you have to scroll through I think that's because it's battery, right?
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.240]   I think is that right you think
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.400]   No, no, no, it's just it's just because nest
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:31.360]   Put everything into the google home and there's a lot in the whole map. You have a well you especially you have a lot of stuff, right?
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:37.760]   Yeah, youtube tv has settled its long running battle with nbc
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.440]   They're going to keep all the channels with no change to monthly fee. We didn't really talk about this is one of those
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.120]   ugly carriage battles who owns nbc, right?
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.440]   Comcast
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:53.040]   And Comcast and google they fight on a lot of opposites. Yeah
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:56.240]   Yeah google almost
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:02.080]   It was it was getting close and of course sunday nbc had a big game where tom bready goes back to new england
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:08.560]   That would have been a big problem if nbc had yanked its feed wouldn't just be that nbc as a lot of other
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.080]   Things they started a website to pressure youtube
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:18.240]   Etc, etc. Apparently they've made a deal google says no price hike
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:28.000]   It later emerged according to 9 to 5 google that nbc wanted google to bundle pcock premium into monthly consumer payments
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.760]   This would have led subscribers to paying more
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:38.320]   With google in august committing to no price hikes in the near term because they've had some steep ones 65 bucks a month now
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:41.120]   And it now is low
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:44.400]   Is it well it's low it's cable money, right?
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:47.840]   I mean it's it's exactly what the
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:55.280]   Channels had been trying to do to the cable guys, right? So in oh, I know this constantly happens. Yeah
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:04.080]   Take our crap channel to go with our good channels. Oh, I see you didn't mean the low priced you meant low behavior
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:06.400]   Yeah, that I
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:13.280]   You confused because 65 bucks. I said 65 bucks. You said that is low and I thought oh, that's talking about
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.760]   No, I'm saying forcing someone to
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:20.720]   Crap channel like pcock premium exactly only thing good on that is the amber rough and shoe
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:28.640]   Okay, and below deck which is pretty good google search no longer supports internet explorer 11 because it is time
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:34.800]   We will I really want to be this spokesperson
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:37.840]   It is time
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:44.080]   The time has come to say goodbye to i 11 which has long been horribly insecure
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:52.560]   Um as a web developer one web developer cramp force on twitter tweeted. This is one of the happiest announcements in a while
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:57.040]   Uh good simple pleasures said
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:04.080]   Yeah, and that my friends is the google changelog coming up next
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:07.280]   Waffle time
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.920]   But first a word from cashfly

[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:58.000]   So I went out and got my holiday decor. I bought a fake tree for the first time ever
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.160]   Yeah, I think we're gonna do that too. Yeah, yeah
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.040]   um just because I couldn't bear like
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.520]   you know
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:10.720]   Plus I live in a place where I can go out and take if I want the smell I can just open my windows
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:12.800]   Yeah, lisa says
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:16.000]   Right you live there lisa says we'll get a wreath. It's okay
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.280]   That that that is my thing like Andrew's like just buy a wreath
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:23.680]   But don't put it inside because we'll get the needles everywhere. I was like
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.520]   Dude
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:28.160]   It's not christmas if it doesn't smell piney
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.040]   Yeah, open the windows you can do that. You know if you're not plugging the needles out of your socks
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.560]   What do you do? I really can't you just go take a tree from your yard
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:42.240]   Yes, that is I could do that for like another 10 to 12 years
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.360]   Oh, that's a good point. Okay. Never mind. So what are you?
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360]   This is my pick string trees
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:57.040]   Every year I think I've done this point before john loves the twinkling. Yes. It's twinkling time
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:06.640]   These are the rgb w because the original rgb's their white is yellow. It's not attractive
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.880]   That's not good. So this has a warm white light
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.400]   And I bought a lot of these. These are expensive y'all. These are 185
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:21.200]   It is a great. I've had some for the last three years. They still work. They've been inside and outside
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:24.480]   So three years of living still doing okay
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:30.560]   Um, the fun stuff about them is I can't get it out of the box. I was going to plug it in so you could see them
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.600]   Well, we're looking at the the dancer on the twinkling site. You might want real ones
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:41.360]   Instead of just this isn't really like very good ad. I don't understand this has nothing to do with christmas
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:47.440]   So these light up your house, right? They're christmas. Are you from on the trees? Oh, oh
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:54.400]   So my strings are not those strings. Those are actual like light strips. My strings are little lights. Okay
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.800]   Like christmas lights
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:58.800]   But they're Wi-Fi enabled
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.440]   Of course they are
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:07.600]   But but good advice do not get rgb ld led because the white is not as yellowy
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:11.600]   The white is totally yellow. So which ones should we get?
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:17.280]   If you if that's important to you they have rgbw special editions
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:24.160]   Which is what I got or you can get they how they call them their elegance collection and they're like golden white and those also are fine
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:26.480]   But they don't have any of the other colors. So why would you do that?
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:29.600]   But some people might be so fancy
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:33.200]   My in-laws only put up white lights. So they might go to that
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:40.880]   Yeah, I like to go to the white lights myself. See it. There you go. And color is so talented. Yeah, the elegance. Yeah
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:44.160]   Okay, here they come. I like that
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:49.760]   You should do you have a video anywhere john of your house because last year he used twinkles to like
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:53.680]   Yeah light it up. Oh, it's cool. Yeah do it john
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.680]   That's all right. Don't worry about it. Sorry. He's got other things
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:01.600]   There you go. So that's my pick. They're grossly
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:07.440]   A lot of fun. You never did get the box oven didn't you? I did get the box
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:20.160]   Looks like it looks like a bunch of dynamite. Yeah. Oh there it is. So you're gonna is that you're gonna be your indoor
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:24.960]   Is that indoor outdoor you're gonna do a lot of lights? Um, these are outdoors. These are indoor outdoors
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:29.120]   But we're wrapping so we have this big oak tree. Oh, that's nice when you wrap the tree
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:33.680]   That's pretty and we're gonna leave them up year round. Good idea
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:41.440]   I'll have valentine's day Halloween you can have like a american flag for the fourth of july you can do all sorts
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.760]   I'm gonna be a spice. No, I was
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:48.560]   But yeah, so we're gonna have lovely lovely lights
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:53.440]   That is oh, this was how i was gonna show you the thing to know. Yes when you're using these
[02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:58.800]   Yes, they don't go end to end so you have to buy as many as you want on one string
[02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:02.880]   Oh, oh, yeah, so that's important
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:09.440]   It is important and can you get as many as you want on one string? I mean there's a lot of you can get up to like this is
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:14.560]   So I did get two four hundreds, but i'm gonna have to plug them into both sides of the outlet. Oh, okay

[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:25.840]   Then you don't have to go outside to turn on your oak tree

[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:36.000]   It's a shrunken head
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:41.440]   Uh jeff javis has a number well, you don't have to oh, let's see it doesn't have to be a number you could be anything
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:45.120]   No, it doesn't i'm gonna i'm gonna mention uh since you did a book earlier i would mention the
[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:49.680]   Uh, Matthew uh kershenbaum who wrote the book that you and i like called track changes
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:55.680]   Has a new book all about word processors, which is really which is which is wonderful
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:59.440]   Yeah, uh, so this is about the the future of digital literary heritage
[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:06.480]   Oh when he says what is textual scholarship when the text of our everyday speech is a transitive verb as often as it is now
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:14.240]   So i want to mention that also while i'm plugging i want to plug the black media report just out today from the center for community media at my very school
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:16.720]   The crag crag crag new mark
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:26.320]   Thank you, uh the black media report dot journalism dot qne dot edu which has a bunch of really amazing stats about
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:29.040]   How black media versus mainstream media?
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.520]   Uh cover the things that matter
[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:40.160]   Uh to all of us now so within corona givers coverage corona virus coverage black media wrote five times more than mainstream media
[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:42.800]   Wow, I think it's a portion of racial impact to the pandemic
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:44.480]   um
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:47.760]   Nearly twice as much as mainstream media on front line and essential workers
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:52.320]   Uh nearly one in four articles of black media mentioned racism related issues
[02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:58.240]   But less than one in ten in mainstream media and on and on and on which all shows how we need to support
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:02.640]   I think mainstream media mass media has had its chance and now it's time to support
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:04.000]   uh
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.960]   Latino media black media and digital media and other media that conserve these communities better than mass media
[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:13.120]   All right, they primarily online or they are their print publications too or oh no lots of particular
[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:17.600]   The history of of black media goes back to 1827 the first
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:19.280]   newspaper
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:25.520]   Published and owned by and four black americans in the us in new york of course because we're the center of the dam universe
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:27.680]   That's where everything happens
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:29.680]   All right, of course all right
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:31.440]   um
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:34.880]   97 different media sources for study so that's cool
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:38.320]   Thank you jeff
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.680]   Mr. Ant Pruitt
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:41.680]   It's time for Pruitt's pick
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:44.160]   I'm going to pivot off of uh mr
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.040]   Jarvis
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.440]   Because there's an app that I just found out about a week or so ago it's called black
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:53.680]   And it's basically allowing you to find black-owned
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:34:00.480]   businesses in your area and I was using okra for oh, but I think it was restaurants, right?
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:03.600]   Yeah, it was restaurant. Yeah, this is everything. Yeah, just restaurants
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:11.600]   And uh, it's it's quite surprising some of the stuff that I found in there because I didn't know and I try to support local businesses around here
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:17.840]   But fact of the matter a lot of the black-owned businesses suffered the most during the pandemic and it would be nice to
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:24.240]   To throw a bone that way to help those businesses continue to grow and thrive just like everybody else
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:28.800]   So yeah, it's a free app on android and uh, ios black
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:32.160]   BLA next double p BLA double p
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:34.480]   BLA double p

[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.480]   I've signed up for a couple classes. Um, just thought of curiosity
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:58.960]   Uh, because they always have a lot of updates and stuff with ai and just to try to make things faster for content creators
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:03.760]   And of course they have their keynotes. Oh look who they've got a lot of interesting people as usual

[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:23.520]   This might be the last virtual one. I imagine they'll get back to it. I miss going. I love going
