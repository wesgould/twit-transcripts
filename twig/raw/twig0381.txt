[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.800]   In this wild and wacky internet world Jeff Jarvis is here professor of journalism at CUNY the city University of New York
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   He's also the author of wonderful books like public parts. What would Google do?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   geek sparing gifts
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.560]   Reinventing news hi Jeff. Hi. Hi. How are you good to see you good to see you?
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.040]   Also joining us Stacy has the day off. She's a little under the weather
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.600]   So we have Kevin Marks from his garden where there's an occasional flyover
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.920]   Buzzed by a prop plane earlier. It's weird Kevin Kevin has worked everywhere including the Google Apple
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680]   British Telecom the beeb
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.020]   You know never asked you Kevin as employers go. Which was your favorite. Oh, that's a good question
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.040]   That's an interesting question. Um
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.240]   Let me let me set let me set the I don't I don't mean in terms of the just just kind of a
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.120]   Gestalt and nice place to be and you'd recommend it to others kind of thing not the specifics of your
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.360]   The big company thinks I mean and that's that's interesting. I think
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.880]   Salesforce and Google were both very good employers from that respect
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.360]   Apple was fairly good, but a bit weird because of the internal chaos stuff
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   You're an apple
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.760]   Before Steve left during steves. I was I was there when exile
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   Just when Steve came back. I joined
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.480]   I joined April 98 and a week later. They launched the I'm at so there was considerable chaos at that time
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   He was really revamping the company
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.840]   There was a bit of chaos there, but also there was apples sort of all structure was very much a court org structure
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.000]   So there was there was different groups that were trying to that were playing to
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.160]   To Steve effectively and competing over stuff and it was that that part of it was very chaotic and that
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.600]   You know that's always problem with companies to some mistake, but it was very much
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.480]   You know my example was we set up a wiki inside quick time to discuss our
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.840]   Project plans and was told by management take it down because the
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.360]   The app team could see what we were thinking and that would be bad
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.160]   So that was you know that was that was my example for first slightly oddness of Apple, but that you know Apple had a lot of great things
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   To we did some this good stuff there, but it's kind of a unique way of doing business, isn't it?
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.960]   But every company has its own style and Apple style was we don't want inter departmental communications
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   It comes from flipping the hardware company and being you know
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.800]   Correctly paranoid about accidentally leaking products ahead of time right because if you're a hardware company
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   That's the worst thing you can do because it destroys the demand for the current product at the point where it's at its most profitable
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.200]   Which is once you've got the manufacturing running smoothly and your your costs are going down
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   Then you bring the new product out and the beginning of that ramp
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.920]   You're losing money on it as you're ramping stuff up
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   But then you get to a point where it's it's profitable and ramps down and you bring the next one in
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.360]   So if you leak the new product before that crossover happens you basically destroy the company and this isn't theoretical
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.000]   Osborne did this palm does right systems. Oh, so this so that's that's sort of where
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.880]   Apple's mindset is because that's that's the kind of process they're selling and
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.800]   Whereas Google isn't doesn't have that problem because they're not well
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.920]   They may be starting to get a bit of that so it's starting to sell hardware
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   But basically that isn't they're not that's not their primary source of revenue
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.880]   And so they can afford to be lax or about these times of internal communication stuff
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   And so the they started from the idea that everyone in the company should know what's going on most of the time
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.320]   And they did to the time that did change was when they started working on Android and then
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.520]   Because they were in that in that same hardware space that team was locked off in a separate building and didn't communicate much
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.440]   so that's you know there is a dynamic there that fits the
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   The kind of product you're making because you can destroy your business in that way and and similarly
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.640]   Whereas you know sales force was very much about future product roadmaps and what's coming out and what we're gonna do next year
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   And they're comfortable doing that because they've basically got a you know
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.600]   They although they've got competitors
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.560]   They've their core customers are expecting to know what's coming next year and look forward to that and that was something Microsoft
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.880]   Historically did they Microsoft's way of crushing a competitor was not surprising with a new product
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.680]   But when when they're connected to announce something they would say oh yeah
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.400]   That'll be the next version of Windows you have to worry about that and that was their way of distracting from the from the competition
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.320]   Microsoft had other structural issues though. They had divisions fighting amongst themselves for
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.480]   Priority and so sometimes you know the office division was powerful they would they could keep the
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.240]   The hardware division from putting it on the hardware. There's all sorts of you know inner nice scene warfare going on
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.560]   I wonder though Apple really kind of showed the value of secrecy and I think a lot of companies have learned from Apple
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   But I wonder if secrecy is the best way to run a company
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.800]   Your customers right depends on the company. Yeah, and I think that's it the other what somebody wrote a critique of Apple recently
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   Saying that you know one of the reasons people get disappointed with Apple now is that they don't have competing divisions
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.320]   They focus everything which means that they're focusing on everything on iPhone and then neglecting the Mac
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   You know there hasn't been a Mac Pro update for three years what the the new Mac books that came out
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.040]   weren't as focused on the this sort of high-end users
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.240]   No video makers and people like that as previous ones were and that that sort of that constituents getting grumpy
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.520]   but because they were always a small part of the business and
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.880]   Because the Mac division isn't sort of
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.400]   Separately competing it's just sort of a part of the whole company and the company moves resources around it's it's harder for them to say
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.600]   Yes, we need to make the best Mac we possibly can because the company would be like no you get the trouble
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.760]   The engineers are focusing on the next release of Iowa's at the moment because that that's much more important right and then
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.880]   There's Google
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.960]   What the hell I mean it's different it structure is very different from when you were there
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:42.520]   I'm sure because of alphabet and now you know, you know, it's clear that Google's management is always trying to find a way to stay
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.920]   Nimble and innovative as you grow into a bigger and bigger hidebound often company
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.440]   Well, I mean something something that Google did and I think still does was the idea that
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.480]   Just because we're big we shouldn't we should just we shouldn't try and introduce layers
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.740]   We should keep we should keep the thing uniform
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.000]   So that the idea of TGI F where they have a company-wide meeting
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   Now on Thursday for time zone reasons
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   But historically on Friday of where the founders get up on stage and anyone in the company wants to come along and listen
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.800]   And those who aren't present can watch it over a stream and can ask questions of the founders. That's something the startups do
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.640]   Scaling it up to a company the size of Google where you've got, you know, tens of thousands of employees around the world
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.600]   It's kind of a crazy thing to do
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.920]   But they did it and they can they try to keep that focus so that anyone could walk up to the mic and ask Sir Gayle area question
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.640]   And I think as far as I know they still do that. I haven't you know, they're very fairly good at like not leaking these things
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.840]   But as far as that does still go on
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.640]   But it was something that was was a challenge as the company grew because it you know
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.080]   It's it's always hard for if one person walk up to the mic and play about something and like derail the whole company for
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.360]   10 minutes that that's the sort of downside of that that model, but it it works
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   You know to some extent, I mean the other thing that Google does a lot of is
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.600]   Not trying to avoid the strategy text you're talking about from Microsoft
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.520]   So not let one team constrain another and that that can be a good thing
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:21.480]   But you know it means we end up with five separate chat clients on our androids because Google's got four different teams building different versions of them
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.520]   Which is which is kind of odd
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   I mean Apple what Apple will do is they'll make a new one every two years and throw out the old ones
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   So there's sort of several generations of dead
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.240]   eye chat and
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.360]   Face time and now it's our message and they know they they just throw away the whole product line
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.760]   Whereas Google will just have three or four competing ones so that if I wanted if I wanted to receive an SMS on my Android
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.280]   There are three or four apps that it could potentially do it depending which one I last spoke to that person it
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.560]   You know what's pleasing to me and we have a number of stories about this is how well Google has handled its new phone
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:04.120]   This was a big departure for Google Google phones the Google Android phones were really developer platforms with the Nexus line and they decided to kind of abandon
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.640]   the Nexus line and create these phones that were priced just like Apple's iPhones and
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.920]   Even though they were only in Verizon also attempting to to kind of compete as as
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.040]   Flankship phones against the other flagship phones and apparently have done quite well some stories here Morgan Stanley's predicting the pixel smartphone will generate Google
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:32.240]   Almost four billion dollars in revenue next year now. That's still dwarfed of course by Apple, but that's a good business
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.880]   Apple sold 212 million iPhones in 2016 for a hundred thirty seven billion dollars
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.240]   But well four billion is big if you have a lot of businesses, you know, Microsoft always says, you know
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.320]   We're looking for billion dollar businesses. Well, this is a billion dollar business. There's no question about it
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:58.800]   But even if Morgan Stanley is low on its estimate, they think they're gonna sell about five or six million pixels and indeed
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   According to Don rising or writing in fortune the Google pixel trounced the iPhone on black Friday pixel activations
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.480]   almost more than doubled
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:17.880]   On the black Friday we can compare to the number of activations in the four preceding weekends iPhone 7 activations only up 13%
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.760]   A Samsung this is from mobile apps and like a company local littics Samsung's Galaxy S's S7 saw 30%
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.000]   36% growth in activations
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.600]   That's black Friday November 24 through cyber Monday November 28th just a four-day
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.640]   period
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.440]   So a lot of people bought pixel phones. I don't know if they bought them at Verizon if they bought them online
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:47.720]   How you're are you happy with your pixel now Jeff? I am I am absolutely and once I once I've got the ways problem fixed
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.580]   Yeah, I like it is a nice phone the battery the battery is very good. It's kind of a deceptive
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.920]   It's deceptive because it doesn't it feels very nor average nothing looks special about it. Yeah
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.920]   But you but it grows on you. Yeah, it does not feels it's it's good a hand candy feels good
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:11.040]   This is it's got a 4k screen has it I'm I remembering that right? No the pixel XL
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   Does the pixel? Oh the XL a small pixel has a 1080p screen and yet both are used for daydream Google's VR headset
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.680]   But everybody's it's got better GPU so that you can do higher frame rates for that stuff, right?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.440]   Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, it's a pretty fast little snappy little I like the little one
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.400]   I got the I had the XL and and I now have the regular small one and
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.480]   I like the small one. It's fun. It's kind of funny
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.160]   I mean they have a phone that's compact is a new idea for me, but I like it
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.240]   It doesn't it doesn't get in the way
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.320]   You have the XL right
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:59.040]   Yeah, I don't I don't have I'm still running the the original you're out of 5x or 6p you're six six your shamu
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.480]   the killer
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.880]   Yeah, again, it's it's the 4k screen that makes it really nice that there's something that we like so success for the first phone that
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.400]   Google really did all by itself didn't go out to a partner to make I
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.860]   Mean they did have a partner make it, but they designed it themselves and engineered it themselves
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.760]   Well, if you don't count Motorola when they had metarella, but yeah, yeah
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.620]   Because because there's a there's a still that's a still a nice phone range it is even effect you we were talking offline
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.580]   On Twitter because I guess your son needed a new
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.760]   Yes, he's phone broke. He dropped it and your other son had a motor
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.680]   Roto Rola. What was it a zed pure zed play?
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.800]   Zed play yeah, that play and liked it and I suggested maybe that would be a good phone
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.080]   Did you did you know he does like it? Yeah? He's a big fan. He I mean he'd had the
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   the
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.460]   The Nexus 5 before well, this is definitely a step up on that
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.040]   So it's different from that but also yeah
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.920]   He really liked the fast charge that was that was a killer feature for him because he's always
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.440]   Dashing around from place to place
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.960]   So that's that you know, I suppose all the new phones have that but that was that was his wow
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.320]   This is much better than my previous phone. Yeah, yeah
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.840]   What we don't have information on is
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.880]   Google's other new products. They just started shipping the Google Wi-Fi. We're gonna get ours the new three units
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:27.400]   We're gonna get ours next week. What about you? Did you order it Jeff? What happened? No, I can't because I missed
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   I you know, I was like a minute too late like everything else that sold out
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.640]   Mm-hmm. How about the Google home? That was on sale for a under a well
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.040]   30 and I paid 30 bucks more than I should have yeah, yeah
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.520]   Do you have it oh?
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.360]   I'll pinch it
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.780]   Trying to decide if you already have an echo you don't
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:57.020]   Here's a funny video made by a guy who has both and he got them to interact interact with one another
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.920]   What's his name? Let me get his name here Adam
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.240]   Jack O'Wenko and he posted this on YouTube
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.940]   He says I decided to have some fun with my echo and Google home listen
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.520]   Alexa what's on my calendar tonight?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   You
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:27.920]   Have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m. I was Alexa what's on my calendar tonight?
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.520]   I hear how much better the echoes. I mean the Google speakers
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:45.560]   I didn't think of this Alexa what's on my own I have an echo and a Google home sitting next to each other just bring it along with us
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.040]   I presume this could go on forever
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:57.160]   You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m. The title is Alexa what's on my calendar tonight?
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.740]   It could go on obviously see that they seem to incorporate some of that
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.320]   Better voice tech we were talking about last time I was on a month ago. So the sound of it
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.280]   Yeah, it's quite good. I think both of them sound fairly natural
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.040]   I use the the I bet you if we see the numbers for the Amazon echo particularly for the
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.280]   They were selling at the dot for $40 over
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.440]   Black Friday. I suspect we'll see massive sales for that. That's that's the that's gonna be a huge
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.480]   I think we saw what did they say two and a half million?
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.860]   Amazon echoes were sold and the bulk of them this year. They've taken off this year
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.360]   Let me see if I can get nobody Amazon doesn't say what their sales are
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.080]   Let me see if I can find this I somebody mentioned what they thought that they had sold
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   Yeah, I don't see it, but
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.120]   Three million units. This is from Geekwire. No, that's April though. There's more. There's got to be something more recent than this
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.640]   Anyway, it's been a very successful two years in
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.020]   And with these great drops and prices I have a feeling
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.320]   according to
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.840]   business insider echo and Alexa could at 11 billion dollars revenue by 2020
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:20.560]   But these these projections for six years out seem wait a minute 2020 is only three years out never mind
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.320]   Moving along
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.880]   I just bought I just bought the three packets back on sale. Oh good
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   Well, we'll have a review for you
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.400]   I use an ear oh and I'm very happy with it. This seems to be very much in that mold kind of a mesh Wi-Fi
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.040]   Network one thing that you wrote does really well as they are very
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:46.320]   aggressive on updating the firmware regularly and tweaking it regularly to make it work better with the devices in your home and
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.480]   So forth and I'd be curious to see how Google does you have a large home, right? Yeah
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   More than 4,000 square feet 45 square feet, so it's quite and it's all one floor. So it's quite spread out. Oh
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.240]   Hey, that's a good test. So it really is. Yeah, there are there are on the periphery. It's really hard
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.960]   Certainly a single router just does not make it and I've tried all sorts of ways of extending it
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.680]   But the best has been a hero so far
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.560]   But but I have what's nice is I have two networks have a Comcast business class network and a Comcast consumer network
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.160]   So the euro right now is on the because a Comcast consumer network when the Google comes up with on the business class network and we can have very
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.160]   Well have a good testing test bed for that you saw of course and I put put it a little bit Google did release
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.320]   Test results that said there Wi-Fi solution was the fastest of all the new mesh solutions
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:40.520]   But that was a test paid for by Google. It didn't impress me particularly with its rigorousness
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.440]   I'd I'd like to see for myself. So we'll have a review probably by next week
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.960]   for you
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.560]   Here's an interesting numbers as long as we're talking big numbers according to Android police Google Aloe
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:02.260]   Was downloaded five million times in the first five days. I can't it's hard to believe it. I mean people knew it existed
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.440]   I you downloaded I downloaded it. We talked have you used it since no?
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.040]   yeah
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   That's probably pretty much the problem. It's a
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:16.440]   Once at the top of the place to our zap rankings is now below position 200 the download counts stall
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   a signal
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.820]   Well, it's not a okay, so signal is
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.760]   I mean ten thousand dollars because I'm seeing everyone I know signing up for signal signal now
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.560]   Signal is getting the Trump pump
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.960]   Get your get your encryption while you can
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.240]   Signals of course the one everybody recommends moxie Marlin spike
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.760]   Has done a very good job with it
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.800]   Uses OTR use all the all the proper buzzwords and it's open open source
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.840]   So it can be validated in fact others are using the signal code platform including Facebook's
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.600]   Messenger I think and what's that
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.960]   however, I don't know what the downloads are because most people I mean do really most people think oh I have I'm now gonna run out and
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.720]   Get encryption. Well apparently so this this article. I'm not sure if it's fake news or not the encrypted chat app
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   That's booming in the post-Trump world
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.280]   Oh people are gonna run out and buy it get this just because of the well just empirically
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.520]   You know
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.040]   I I'm seeing lots of people sign up for it because it because there's a slightly weird thing about it from critic chat app
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.840]   Is it tells you when your friends sign up if they're in your if you have their phone number?
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.360]   Right and that's frankly a
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   flaw
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   It's using the same weird model that WhatsApp uses and all users which is your phone number is your identity
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.840]   So on the on the on the app store right now signal private messenger has a mere million downloads
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   So it did not it does not have the
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.160]   Downloads of aloe aloe bested it by
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.080]   500%
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.040]   Aloe has encryption, but it's not you have to turn on it's not on by default signal of course is encrypted all the time
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:00.880]   Yeah, by default aloe reads everything through Google so that it can use the assistant right? Yeah, which it doesn't bother me
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:07.560]   Even in the Trump era. I don't know it's so funny. I mean I think that's kind of a knee jerk reaction. I don't know if
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.160]   I mean, I guess how would well how it's principle, but how will we know if it's time to say oh?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.880]   I better encrypt everything. I'll tell you the Snoop you know what the bigger one than the Trump selection is the stupers charter in Great Britain
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.960]   Yes, it's awful established a precedent in the Western nations for unprecedented snooping
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.600]   and deprecation of
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   Encryption as well and so that would be a if you live in the UK, right? Kevin would you would you say let's go out and get signal now
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   Before it's too late. Yeah, no fact my friends the open rights group are saying exactly that
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.040]   Yeah, they've been pushing against this for a long time because they've been trying to bring this into law for ages
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.680]   Because it's not I mean it's not unprecedented if you remember the Snowden revelations
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.020]   Basically said that this was going on and this was retrospective legalization in the same way that us retrospect
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.320]   Well, that's that's what the apologists say is no, this is good now
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.840]   We know what they're doing and this is all regulated now because in the past it's all just better
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   Everybody's doing it without any regulation. That's in fact if you look at the petition because
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.520]   I guess in the UK now they have that petition thing that
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   Started in the Obama administration here in the United States where you can go on to a government site and sign a petition and the petition
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.440]   exceeded the number of
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.640]   signatures very rapidly
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.240]   It needed a hundred thousand signatures for parliament to consider it for debate
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   It has 147,000 as as we record today. However
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.520]   No, no move from parliament to debate it and the government response is
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.760]   The investigatory powers act. That's the Snoopers charter dramatically increases transparency
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.880]   around the use of investigatory powers it protects both privacy and
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.720]   Security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.940]   Yeah, but it's still there's the the open rights groups says there's
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:07.980]   It's they've taken it to the European Court of Justice and they're awaiting a ruling on that
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.360]   Huh
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.800]   It's not gonna be overturned you think
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.540]   In fact, it's a roadmap for the United States and other Western nations to do exactly the same thing
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.440]   I have to think Congress our Congress is eyeing this saying hey, they got it through in the UK
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.440]   Does it does it out? You know, I should read this the bill more carefully it
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.200]   I know the main thing is it requires ISPs to hold
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.860]   Everything you do including what sites you visited for more than a year
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.580]   It gives all sorts of British authorities
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:50.200]   Including like the food safety authorities the right to ask an ISP for what you've been doing on your phone or your computer
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.080]   even without
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.080]   Proving that the you're up to no good
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But I I do wonder
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.480]   What it what it's standing is on encryption does it block encryption I'd say I seem to remember having read that
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.240]   I
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   It requires you to hand over
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:14.040]   Encryption well, they've already had the thing to hand over encryption keys
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   Okay, so back doors
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.520]   No, no, not by doors. They're basically that they if you if they got something that if the of yours that is encrypted
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   They could demand an encryption key for me. Ah
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.480]   Okay, so that's been ruled by courts in the United States to be a violation of the
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:37.440]   Right you can use your finger, but not your your key right? Right. It's uh, it's unlawful for seizure fifth
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.640]   Fourth fourth. All right. What's the fifth?
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:48.600]   Probably something take the fifth. Please the fifth self-incrimination fourth is an unreasonable search research and seizure. Yeah, it's of course
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   You know the UK doesn't have that so
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.800]   You don't have any of it
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:00.920]   No, we well we have a bill of rights, but doesn't include these things. Yeah, it does introduce a fight a FISA like court a panel of judges
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.360]   Yes, who can oversee which wasn't there before so I think that's one of the arguments that this is better than
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.200]   The kind of ad hoc system
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:15.280]   Okay, here's the encryption encryption. Let's see here. This is the computer world UK
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:22.520]   Still has encryption problems. Parliament continues to grapple with end-to-end encryption in the investigatory powers bill
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.080]   This is oh, but this is a pre passage so I don't know
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   Yeah, I'm looking for the open rights good NASA so they're completed one
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:40.800]   In any event this does seem so your your
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.160]   Scariest is scary precedent and it's something that yeah the worries the fear would be that they would outlaw
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   Strong encryption like signal. There's no way signal which is made in the US would
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.820]   Cow tau to British laws putting a backdoor in it in fact
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.720]   That's like what offshore it before he'd do that even in the US
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.920]   So it will never let's presume it would never have a backdoor would it then be outlawed in countries that you know Russia says
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.200]   We're not gonna allow strong encryption without a backdoor
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.640]   so that's
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.120]   That's where the sort of internet filtering stuff so they may be demand that the app stores are filtered as well
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   So there's that there's that aspect of things right
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:26.040]   Yeah, you can't find it, but they'll be a I think there'd be a brisk black market in the stolen APK's
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:34.200]   But that's but this is part of the point. I mean that so Matt Chechikovsky was was talking about this last week basically saying okay
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.880]   We've got until in all duration to purge the databases before the government decides to start teasing them
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:47.040]   He's basically saying if you work for a large company and you've been keeping user records your best bet is to
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.280]   Delete them so that you can say I don't have those user records
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.000]   because at the point that
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.640]   The government passes the law saying we can access your data and you can't tell him when access your data is too late in fact
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.400]   all companies should at this point establish a policy of
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.960]   deleting logs on a regular basis preferably as quickly as possible yes
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.680]   That that's that should be the next step on something
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.080]   It's basically asking for a cultural change which is you know
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.300]   Historically engineers like to log things and logs were cheap
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.000]   So you keep logs and everything to strong work
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.240]   So you can always go back and see what happened and there's been a push from this me F F and the open rights group people like that for a while saying
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.520]   Don't keep logs for a long time
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.400]   Delete them as soon as you can so that they can't be taken and so you know the UK government has is
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.160]   Requiring ISPs to keep logs on people for 18 months now
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.680]   I don't know exactly what the time period was in the IP board something like that
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.720]   There's you know that but they're required to do that by law in the UK
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.840]   The ISPs are and that the but the thing is that the lot of companies have been keeping you know more than that and for longer
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.640]   Because that's what they use to do targeted advertising and behavioral
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.520]   Dividing and all that stuff
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.360]   So they keep it around a bit on the off chance
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.480]   They'll come up with a way to come up with something clever for it
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.160]   And that is the stuff that you know Corey doctor has called it toxic waste for a while
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.760]   Matchy did another a great one of his
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:17.080]   Talks about this as well basically saying you are creating liabilities for people might keep throwing this data on your servers
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   And you should you know flip the default do not store
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.880]   Behavior that about people and if you can avoid store identifiable data
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:31.000]   You should avoid that too and that's that that is the challenge moving forward as you as you start to assume that
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.160]   You know the challenge is you can't really compete with a nation state if you've got a nation state that wants something
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.240]   And they have the resources of the US government they can probably get that from you
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.680]   So the answer is not to have it in the first place to have it in the first place
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:48.920]   Yeah, not to fight the subpoena, but not to have anything they could subpoena right to that end Brewster Kale says
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.280]   He's gonna move the internet archive to Canada. Yes. We'll copy it. He's making a copy
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:01.520]   Unfortunately, that's why I used to poo poo those ideas not anymore. It's a mirror in Canada
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.400]   He says to defend himself against a Trump administration
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.160]   What I don't understand that at all that seems like another knee jerk reaction
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.880]   Do you think the Trump administration would demand that the archive be deleted you have one of?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   Trump's advisors on this stuff says that our national security says that use of encryption alone is suspicious right
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.560]   Right, that's always been and they say even said that
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:36.080]   You know James Admiral clapper said that you know if you if you using a VPN
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:43.320]   Or PGP that you're we Snowden told us that now you're in the database automatically. So this is not new
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.160]   Which was part of the push for the encryption metaphor and what's happened and it's why we yes
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   And it's why I encourage everybody to use PGP or GPG because if we all use it then we all are all Spartacus
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.480]   PGP is annoying enough that it's pretty hard to keep using it, but yes, I
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   Turn it. It's not that annoying if you have a good email client that supports it
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   That's the trick is to get an email compliance that's a client that supports it
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:14.120]   I have it turned on I send my email signature has my PGP key and as soon as somebody sends me something encrypted
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.960]   I buy default will automatically from then on encrypt back to them
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.280]   It doesn't take any extra effort on my part
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.640]   But the sort of the counter push to that is that if you're signing everything then you are very fine that you sent it
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.280]   And that that means that you're spreading at a station
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.520]   So that's the you if you're signing it and not encrypting it you may be causing yourself more trouble
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.120]   I sign all my email, but that that's historically because I don't want to be spoofed
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.880]   I don't want people impersonating. Yeah, that's that's it's it's all about threat model and you're the your threat model that makes sense
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.520]   Yeah, I mean, that's it. That's the other discussion. Yeah, the other discussion about activism and and you know
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.840]   Stop using Twitter and start using signal and things like that
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.880]   There's been interesting discussion of that from
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.240]   Zenipt to Fekki and
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:05.360]   Quinn more than people like that who are saying actually a lot of what activists need is the ability to access these public spaces and be able to speak in public
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.640]   But they also need to have private communications amongst themselves that aren't public
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.560]   And at the moment we entangle them together
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.280]   So we'll use Twitter or Facebook place we publish staff and also as our channel for communications
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:27.400]   And we're relying on that that stuff not to get intermingled and that's so part of I think part of the reason people are picking up signal is thinking about
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.000]   Can I decouple these things? You know, can I move music different ways of doing that?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.920]   Well, we know we know that Twitter has
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.900]   Authentication so if you're tweeting with a blue check, we know it's you
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.680]   Well, what is it to you?
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.900]   He spoke does - what do you think? What do you think just kind of offhand?
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:54.560]   What do you think is gonna happen in January 20th when president Trump now has at potus as well as at
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.840]   the real Donald Trump is he gonna you know be kind of interesting as if he like
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.560]   Preserved one at potus for official announcements and then he could ones iPhone ones Android
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:11.840]   I really I have to say and I've said this before I remember how much I hated Twitter now that Trump is tweeting so much
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:18.040]   I think it's a it's a huge important channel to his inner workings his inner thoughts
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.840]   He's also no, but he's this is a game. He's using it to manipulate as well. You think yeah
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   He's just manipulate like crazy distract for people from real news with fake news
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.920]   Exactly fine. That's still a value to us to see it and see what he's like colleagues in media. I blame more
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:39.000]   Oh, I don't blame anybody for fake news except that people want to believe it and we were talking before the show
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.040]   I don't I think I think it's not fake news. That's the problem because there's some stuff that yes just
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:51.240]   bogus it's conspiracy theories which are hard to disprove and spread like wildfire and the internet has proven to be an
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:57.160]   amazing fertile greenhouse hot house for conspiracy theory and and
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.240]   President like Trump is a huge conspiracy theorist. He loves that stuff eats it up and
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.840]   That's a more of a problem to me because you can't disprove conspiracies
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.480]   No, but also Trump is is not concerned about
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:18.200]   Whether you believe him or not but he's speaking to his audience. Yeah, yeah, he's speaking to his audience
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.540]   But also he's primarily speaking to establish
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.440]   dominance and control so he him saying this thing is
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:34.280]   This is this is the thing and I'm not supporting it. That's actually a power play. That's him saying I can get this across even without supporting evidence
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.560]   because
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:43.040]   I have that see I could just say that there were millions of illegal votes and it becomes so and then and then of course to change
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.920]   Then he then challenged a reporter to prove it not so instead of say instead of you know the questions
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.600]   What's your evidence?
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.840]   President like Trump instead his response is what's your evidence is not true. It must be true. Yes, it's a conspiracy theory
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:05.600]   It's an that's conspiracy there. So the question rule and Ramis running in and slate is would Facebook or Twitter ever ban
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.080]   President Trump and Twitter has said yeah, if he violates our rules
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.720]   I love that and we'll ban him what but Facebook says no
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:23.040]   Due to the newsworthiness of whatever he tweets, but somebody in the chat room just pointed out
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.120]   that
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120]   I'd spell a little known
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.440]   Fact but in fact the president of the United States has an unblockable channel to all smartphones in the country
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.320]   You cannot turn off the alerts
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.560]   From the president of the United States those are that is an unblockable channel
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.680]   Oh god, he starts using that for 3am tweets
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.760]   I you know, I'm sorry
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.080]   And I know everybody's really it's all horrific and people are so scared
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.840]   There's a certain
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.240]   Admittedly it's an amusement to this too
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:03.440]   I mean it won't be amusing if he launches a nuclear strike against azur by john, but but but i know i love my
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.560]   Or get the better of me in my language the other night. I saw that you were really
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:15.200]   Peaved I was extremely peeved and I and in the light of morning. I regret it only one word
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.120]   Because I do believe we call liars liars and please people don't
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.920]   I we know we disagree but but the the
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:29.200]   Two million votes stolen from me thing is it is it is it on tray to voter suppression?
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   Yes
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.760]   And and the conspiracy theory here is there's tons of voter fraud. We have to change all kinds of laws
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.840]   And we have the power to do so keep more people from voting right and that that's already been a just a voter ID laws
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.640]   Is a movement that's been going on throughout the country and in many cases
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:53.040]   Locked by courts successfully and yet courts have overturned these in several at least several cases several states
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.080]   Because it is a fundamental violation of the constitution on in my opinion
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.800]   But there was there's a problem with the voting rights act and the supreme court not holding it out longer being forced is what it is
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.120]   Yeah, well, that's interesting
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.160]   See but that but see that's why I like the idea. I like these tweets because I think they stimulate a conversation
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.600]   No, but the problem is that they're not they're not meant to be factual. They're meant to be directional. There's yeah, I understand
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.000]   So it's like the rallies. It's like a rally. He's he treats. He loves those rallies. He's like treating twitter like a
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.240]   24/7 rally. Yes. He's the only American president who's going to end up. He has a big rally tomorrow
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:38.000]   Uh, and he's gonna he's gonna keep doing that because he loves the adoration. Isn't that funny? He doesn't he feels like he's still running
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.720]   Oh, yeah, it's very strange
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.760]   Um, well, I I will watch with interest. Well, to some extent he is until the 19th remember
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.000]   No, that's not that there's no way you're gonna get the election
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.080]   It's gonna do that, but that's he you know in a sense for him. He is still running
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.920]   And he he is doing that to to keep them on side as well, right
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.400]   But also in in in in a lot of sense
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.560]   His modus operandi is to to establish dominance. He will say anything and do anything to show that he's in charge
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.960]   Right. Um, and he doesn't really care if he's consistent or not because he's he's focused on the moment
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:18.400]   And that's he that's how he's operated for 70 years. He's not going to change now. Yeah, I'm not the I feel like that
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.000]   the we've got very strong norms in place to
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   to protect us against
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.640]   an authoritarian president if it happens, I mean, well, then we'll have to
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:36.720]   Run to this barricades, but well that is too late. No, it's not too late. You run to the barricades before it happens
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.080]   No, no the point is you keep your you keep your antenna up. You keep your
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.520]   You download signal and install it and you yeah, have you watched have you watched Keith old woman?
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.440]   Yeah, he you know Keith's in that job too, but but it's
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.000]   File under under amusing and it's the perfect time for him
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.040]   If it's anger. Yeah, so he has a resistance series on youtube
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.920]   Run, I think you yeah
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.240]   My fear is that
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   It's almost like crying wolf we can
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.960]   Too much of this will will endure us
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.320]   Uh to it and when the time really does come
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:18.080]   To to stand up and be counted people say oh yeah that again keeps back at it
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.880]   Well, that's the other point of this is it's not it's not fake news. It's propaganda. It's part of the point is to is to
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.480]   um
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:33.040]   Dispel the idea that there is and I there is news and there is truth at all and if you can say that I really resent
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:40.320]   Yeah, that I really resent that's that's actually the goal of a lot of this that's psychologically erodes our minds
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.600]   Fundamentally, I think it's very very big problem and the again the internet really lends itself
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.600]   To the to this kind of erosion because we're already bombarded
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   You know we have talked in the past about how the internet made facts commoditized it used to be a fact had real
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.360]   Value that's what the job of reportage was together facts who what where when why?
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.080]   And if I was talking with my 13 year old actually now 14 year old
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:12.960]   And uh we were talking about facts and we had just asked the google home something and it told us something and I said
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.680]   What do you think it was like in my when I was your age if I wanted to know how much a blue whale weight?
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.360]   What do I do and and his friend said you'd go to the encyclopedia? I said yep, that's right
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.800]   That's why I have an encyclopedia in my bookshelf that's completely obsolete now
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.960]   And if it wasn't in the encyclopedia, how would I find out and they were baffle?
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.160]   I said well you have to go to the library and look it up. So facts had real value. They were worth a lot
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.880]   Now that fact that's interesting so the facts really valued
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.520]   That's they're completely devalued and we thought that was a good idea because that meant you could get all the information
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.240]   You need and now you can use your critical thinking the real the real skill
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.200]   To assess and and do synthesis and come up with new ideas
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.920]   I remember my uh my late father-in-law who was a science teacher in high school
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.160]   When we first gave him an iPad said kind of kapurnicus could have had had this kapurnus because spent most of his life
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:08.400]   Gathering the data, you know grinding telescopes to gather the data had he had the data
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.880]   He could have spent most of his life synthesizing it coming up with theories and and so he said we live in an age now
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.640]   Where you can do that but what I didn't anticipate and there's but this is a long list of things
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.400]   We didn't anticipate what the internet would do to us is that by by making facts completely valueless
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.040]   That we've let the word fact is now meaningless
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:37.200]   And that is that is that's the erosion of our uh of of something fundamental
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.800]   That there is a fact and that this that is true or not true or not
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   It's not the business. It's reality. Yeah as um
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.760]   I was talking to somebody who was in the business who was shocked when when an editor said to him. Well, I have my truth
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.000]   ah
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   But it's kind of true. I mean, I you know, I kind of see the other side
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.400]   That uh that a lot of what we consider to be truth is shaded by our ideology
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.640]   Well, I mean that the you know the challenge is you know, you get into epistemology
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.320]   It's like how do we know something is true? What basis do we have for supporting that?
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.880]   um and
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.360]   The best thing we have is scientific empiricism
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.840]   But even that is is is difficult in that it's not as you know, the idea that you can create an experiment that's reproducible
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.920]   That has that has become under challenge in recent years people have started trying actually reproducing them and found that in large fields
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.360]   um
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.360]   People have been basically p-value shopping and and trying out different
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.120]   Variations of the data to get something that shows a plausible correlation
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.360]   Then they publish that one and then when you go and try and reproduce the experiments, um, you can't do it
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.720]   Yeah, we're seeing them a lot. That's turned out to be that was a common mo
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.160]   Right and and this and it's partly this was, you know
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.280]   um psychology experiments and things like that where you you naturally have to work with small groups and you
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.560]   And the statistics are something that isn't core to the system
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.400]   I'm not saying vegan or overturn, you know quantum mechanics or something where there is significant stuff like that
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.480]   but there is um
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.320]   Nathan yerganston wrote a post about factiness about the idea
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.920]   Which is like the the counterpart to truth in its truth in this is like this thing sounds like it should be true
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.840]   Therefore, I will say it and that's the you know, the um call where thing
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.240]   The factiness is this is this thing looks like a fact and therefore I would defend it
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.320]   Um, and I I'm I'm proud that I have a fact in my piece
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.880]   Even if it doesn't necessarily correspond with reality
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.680]   So it's when people spend a lot of time saying but gdp per capita has gone up
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.920]   Under abama and not looking at what the actual distribution of ddp
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.520]   Per capita has done that that's that's an example of factiness
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.160]   You've you've picked a measure that suits your your argument
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.200]   But doesn't actually ring true to a large number of people in the country because actually they've been doing pretty badly
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:54.080]   So are we better off? I mean um or or worse off so in the old days
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.960]   We said all the encyclopedia the new york times if it's in a book it must be true
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.480]   Those those were trusted sources and we've learned that uh, you know
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.840]   Thanks to many things that they maybe weren't quite as trusted
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.560]   Uh as we thought but our but
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.520]   Was it better that at least to have something that was kind of trusted or is it mean?
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.480]   We're actually really closer to the truth of the matter institutional argument, which I hear all the time
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.840]   It's an elite. It's a fundamentally elite instead elitist argument. No, I think I think that on the net
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.880]   We're better off most people want to be correct
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:34.160]   Most people I really honestly believe don't want to be wrong if given the opportunity. I would disagree with you
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.480]   I think most people want to be
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.960]   What it's they do it you're saying it's post hoc
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.640]   A pre proctor hawk. I'm saying it's post hoc people form their ideas
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.840]   And then look for proof that it's correct
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.120]   Sometimes absolutely yeah. Yeah
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   Somebody's coming after Kevin
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.200]   It's actually a leaf blower. I think which is
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.720]   No, I think is it chainsaw two gods away. Sorry about lord
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.880]   Um, but yeah, I yeah, I think this is very interesting and I I wish I'd studied more philosophy and epistemology and
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.080]   and ontology and all of this stuff because uh
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.640]   This is an age old debate and age old discussion, but it's really been brought to the forefront by
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.000]   the the kind of proliferation of facts
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.520]   It's really interesting. I'm glad you talked about this because I hadn't thought with that way and I and I get that
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:32.000]   But I still have to believe that a world with more facts is better than often world fewer facts world more data
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.280]   Yeah to use is better off the world with that then we gotta get good use it then we gotta get good at
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.920]   Measuring this the yeah, well, that's that's that's our fault as humans misusing it
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:50.160]   But clearly if you if you gave kapurnicus more data and more facts would be better off
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.640]   Maybe he was better off grinding his own lenses and observing for himself. I don't know
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:00.800]   Have either of you been warned by google that your account is under attack by a foreign government
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:08.400]   I was warned but not the foreign government piece. I feel bad. I didn't get that. I think i'm not important enough to get that warning
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.960]   um
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.720]   paul krugman
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.160]   Michael mccfall
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.160]   Keith oleberman
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.800]   Uh julia yafi
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.320]   All received warnings from google. Let me see if we can find if I can find it
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:28.800]   Uh, here's julia's post government backed attackers may be trying to steal your password
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.440]   This comes direct from google
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.800]   There's a chance this is a false alarm, but we believe we detected a government backed attacker trying to steal your password
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.120]   This happens to less than 0.1 percent
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   One in a thousand of all gmail users aren't you lucky?
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.960]   We can't reveal what tipped us off because the attackers will take note and change their tactics
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.240]   In fact google delayed apparently google delayed these even these notifications a few weeks
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:56.080]   Because they were afraid that would it would give information to the attackers
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:02.240]   To further improve your security based on your current settings. We recommend setting up a security key or install password alert
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.720]   What's security security key is just to factor
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.160]   You know, they don't say to the word to factor. I'm not sure why the password alert
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.800]   I think is that new thing that google does where if you have a google an android phone
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.920]   Actually it even works with an iphone when you log into your account it then sends an alert to your phone that you say
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.800]   It says you're trying to log in right and you say yes or no
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.880]   Which is kind of basically it's two factor. I don't know why they've decided to use that for two factor instead of
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.520]   uh, the google authenticator
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.240]   I guess authenticator must be what they mean by security key
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.560]   SMS as well it has other other
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   Yeah, nist has said stop using SMS
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:50.080]   Yeah, it's deprecated because it's way too easy for a hacker to social engineer your phone number out of the phone company
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.040]   So that they can intercept your SMS messages
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.160]   Um, I don't know this that this alert thing is impervious to that
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.800]   I guess it would be because you'd have to log into your google account
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.640]   On that phone and that means so it's yeah, I guess it would be better than just a text message
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.280]   Right, so it assumes if they've already got you logged in somewhere else right?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.160]   Yeah, it's kind of yeah, it's kind of a chain of trust from
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.120]   From what your current device to the next device apple does basically the same thing you have to approve
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.160]   an apple login from another apple device
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.400]   But so everybody should turn that on here's a fun story
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.960]   1 million google accounts compromised by guligan
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.320]   Well aptly named al re android malware 86 apps and third party marketplaces can root 74
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.680]   Percent of all android phones, but that's because most android phones are not on a modern version of android
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.320]   This affects ice cream sandwich jelly bean kit cat and lollipop
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.440]   Uh if you are on
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:57.360]   If you are on uh, marzipan or nougat, what is am I forget marshmallow or nougat? You're okay
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.880]   but
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:05.040]   Most users on android are not and unfortunately a lot of the people who are vulnerable to this are
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.840]   People who have less expensive phones in uh and other nations
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:15.680]   who haven't you know who are have carriers and companies that manufacturers that don't care about updating
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.960]   and uh, so
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.280]   You know the most vulnerable people in some ways
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.720]   Guligan
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.640]   Begins when a user downloads and installs an infected app on a vulnerable device
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.960]   And as I said there are a lot of apps although note those apps are on third party app stores
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   So step one do not
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.640]   Download apps from other sources get them from the google play store
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.120]   But if you've got that third you know go to your settings and turn off
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.920]   Install applications from third parties that should not be on in your google phone
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.160]   Because you might even get a link in a malware or a phishing message that that downloads and installs an APK
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.920]   That'll be blocked if you don't have that setting turned on. It's not on by default
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.840]   After an infected app is installed it sends data about the device to the command and control server
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:13.440]   Guligan then says ah, yes, I'll be with you in a moment then downloads a root kit from the server which takes advantages of multiple exploits
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.240]   on android 4 and 5
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.040]   If rooting is successful the attacker of course has full control of the device
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.520]   And can do whatever the hell he wants remotely
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   After root access Guligan downloads a new amalicious module from the server and installs it on the affected device
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:37.360]   This module injects code into running google play or google mobile services to mimic music behavior. So Guligan can avoid detection
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.960]   Geez louise at this point
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.680]   You can Guligan will can gives you the option to steal a user's google email account
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:51.040]   And authentication token information. So if they can get into your system and you're using google authenticator
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:57.680]   It gets the secret from google authenticator. Now you're two factors useless. That's why google is probably recommending this new system
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.720]   Install apps
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.520]   Wait, wait, wait, two vectors useless because so the way the authenticator works
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.560]   Right is it creates a six digit code that is from the current time
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.440]   And a secret number
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.720]   Yes
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.920]   So if they can get your secret number from authenticator
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:24.480]   They can authenticate for many device your secret number should be protected. It's as important as your password
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.400]   So if they've rooted the phone, I mean i'm projecting this it doesn't say this specifically though it implies it
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:36.080]   They say you can get they they can steal authentication token information. I don't know if that means
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   inbound
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.360]   Codes or actually just get the secret if they get the secret it's all bets are off they can generate codes all day
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.960]   Is the secret in it forever? It was one side set up. Yes secret is forever. You can reset it forever. Yeah, you can reset it
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.840]   Um, you know, you can get a new secret
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   So my temptation is to say that the the
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:01.120]   Those secrets should be reset on some timetable. However, when that secret is communicated. That's a weak vulnerable point. Yeah
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.720]   That's why they do it with qr code
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.600]   So
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   When you first set up google two factor, right? You get a qr code on the screen
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.360]   That's the secret numbers in that qr code and you scan it with your phone because you wouldn't want to enter in a 20-digit number
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.080]   and now it's in your phone and and
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.680]   You know, you preserve that qr code at your peril
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.280]   You're not supposed to you're supposed to say okay, bye-bye and that's done and that now the only thing that has that secret number is your
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.600]   Authenticator, but you can manually reset it. I think this new system
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:40.400]   Is is better is more secure. I'm not a security expert. I said for your workplace where your phone is not going to work for three days
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:44.720]   Right, it's a little bit of a pain in the butt, but so all security is is it not?
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.440]   Was it a travel internationally? Yeah
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   I'm not sure it's the base token that taking but the the basic the if they're getting the intercepting the sms then yeah, I would assume that authenticator
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.320]   Puts the token somewhere safe. It's more that
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:08.080]   If you're using google services through the web browser, then you're basically sending
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:14.720]   Authentication token from the from the browser. That's not so bad because you only have 30 seconds to use it the tokens only good for 30 seconds
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:21.040]   But yeah, if you can if you can get them on the list you reset it and create new ones then that's much more problem. That's a real problem
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.600]   Yeah, not clear
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:31.280]   This stuff is hard and director of Android security Adrian Ludwig said he and other google officials have worked closely with checkpoint the company discovered this
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:37.120]   To investigate ghoul again and to protect users against the threat it poses. There's no evidence data was accessed
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:43.120]   From compromised accounts of that individual users were targeted. No, the one of the main things that they do is not to
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.520]   steal your information to to attack you but to put adware on your phone
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:53.840]   To generate revenue or to install apps from google play and rate them to raise their reputation
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.680]   So kind of garden variety scams
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.200]   Uh
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:08.160]   Google's been using a service called verify apps to scan individual handsets for signs of ghouligan and other ghost push apps
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:16.640]   And when detected device owner owners receive a warning installations are halted. So that's that that's that I think that new thing where when you download
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.720]   This is a great feature
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   And I I didn't realize they could backport it to earlier versions of android when you download a new app it scans it before it installs it
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:34.880]   Oh, we've taken many actions to protect our users and improve the security of the android ecosystem overall including revoking affected users google account
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:41.280]   Tokens providing them with clear instructions to sign back in securely removing apps related to the issue from affected devices deploying
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:49.520]   Enduring verify apps improvements. So they're doing the best they can but the problem this fundamental is that old versions of android do not get fixed
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.960]   Let's take a break
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.360]   Kevin you got to go in 10 minutes
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Yes, they're abouts
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.400]   I'm not going to remind you of the time and hope that you forget
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:10.080]   Are sure they've brought to you by fresh books if you're a if you're a freelancer a small business
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.560]   You know the thing you hate doing the most is well sending out invoices
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.280]   It's also the thing you must do the most because that's how you get paid fresh books makes it easy
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.440]   You can create invoices in less than 30 seconds that look professional. They've got your logo on it
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.120]   Uh, the color scheme any images you want that reflect your brand and mean their their personal
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.560]   Invoices you can chat with your client regarding an invoice once they receive it. That's built in
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   You'll be able to see which invoices you've sent which have been viewed. There's never a question whether your client saw it or got it
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.840]   It pings you when they do and which have been paid as well as overdue and outstanding invoice total
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.240]   So you've got on the dashboard. This is that brand new
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.160]   Fresh books dashboard all new you've got all the information you need about how your business is doing
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.480]   So many small business owners if you ask them have you made a profit this year can't even answer that question let alone how much
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   But all you have to do now is launch fresh books and you'll say yes, I have and here's how much
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.120]   You'll have quick access to outstanding balances spending total profit
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.600]   And you could generate, you know those fancy accounting reports if your
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.600]   Bookkeeper needs them like sales tax summaries and profit and loss statements
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.520]   Track expenses by vendor and category and category two so you know how much you spent to make your money
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.320]   If you do time and our billing
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.960]   There's a tracker in the app and on the web makes it easy to track your time to the minute
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.320]   And when it comes time to create the invoice it just goes right in there
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   So you'll know exactly what you did and when you did it
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.800]   I can go on and on but here's what I want you to do try it free
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.720]   This new dashboard is awesome. And if you're a current fresh books user
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.560]   And if you haven't already received that notification you can
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.640]   Upgrade to the new dashboard, but you can also stay with the old one if you're comfortable with it
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:59.200]   But new users will get the new dashboard and you will love it. It's a 30 day unrestricted free trial waiting for you at fresh books
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.400]   Dot com slash twig fresh books dot com slash twig
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.960]   Uh, and if you do me a favor just say this week in google when they ask how did you hear about it?
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.520]   That way we get credit for it
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.480]   This week in google yeah, this google again is a is a nasty one here's a bad hack
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   Here's a bad hack
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.680]   this weekend
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.400]   All the gates were open at the san francisco muni
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:27.840]   Yes, you just walked on the train because apparently
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:36.960]   Somebody got ransome where on at least some of the muni systems seven are they're asking for 73 thousand dollars
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.440]   in ransom
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.400]   Now the whole system wasn't hacked because obviously the system that ran the trains wasn't because they kept the trains
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.840]   going
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.560]   But the I think the money stuff was gonna say
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:54.080]   Anybody could just walk through those turnstiles the hackers claim they control 2,000
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.680]   computers of their 8,000 computer of sf municipal transits 8,000 network
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.440]   system
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.960]   uh, if you
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.040]   Saw the quiox. I didn't see this maybe you maybe you did kevin if you saw the quiesques
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.600]   downtown on saturday
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.560]   It said you hacked
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.200]   All data encrypted contact for key
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.160]   They gave out a yandex.com address
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:26.320]   If there was of course a plot at the good wife
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:31.200]   Where they had data and they didn't have it backed up and so yeah, they had to pay
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.800]   Yeah, I would as low as they have a backup of the data
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.200]   What how does this scam work against it doesn't but of course there's
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.920]   You don't pay the 73,000 if if you have anything else you could do
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:49.600]   And I presume muni is well enough runs so that they can just you know clean the systems and put the data on
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.640]   It just means and by the way everything's back to normal now. So that's probably revert to the prior version
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.680]   Yeah, that's probably what could have happened
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.040]   Was that they were down for a few days as they fixed it
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:07.120]   And now they're back up and presumably without paying the hundred bitcoin that the hacker
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.920]   wanted
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   Which is what 70 grand?
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.480]   73,000 dollars
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.160]   Probably what happened was uh, well, okay, so
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.880]   Uh, this is from hoodline.com
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.840]   Mike grover a Bay Area security researcher who aided hoodline in investigating the story
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.520]   Said there are a few ways the hackers could have taken over a muni system my gut
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.560]   Quote my gut says they found a way to get inside before spreading the ransomware through their domain controller
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.040]   or an administrator's machine
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.440]   And then leverage that to use the administrator's access to effect the rest of the network
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:49.680]   Easiest way to do this and it happens all the time. It's what happened to sony's you sent a fishing email to a bunch of employees one of them
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.960]   Yep believes it
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.440]   Uh the real qua by the way, it also impacted the paychecks
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.280]   Muni workers are not sure if they're gonna get paid this week, which is not good
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.080]   And without collecting fairs it costs them more than half a million dollars a day
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.200]   to run muni
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:15.840]   Fair fair machines were back up though after the weekend. So that's that's the good news the scary thought though is
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.880]   That they were hacked at all and you know if they'd hacked oh we lost kevin by kevin
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.840]   If they had hacked the
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.720]   If they had hacked the controllers the computers that controlled the trains they could have caused a wreck
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.520]   Yeah
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.680]   Not good the signal system. Yeah
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:44.240]   You could have like what happened in jr. Z. That was operator error though, right that was yours
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.200]   What happened to that did they
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:52.960]   Are they trying uh he um suffers from sleep apnea? Oh he fell asleep
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:58.640]   Well, they don't know that but they but they revealed that he suffers from he did he was undiagnosed to having sleep apnea
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:06.160]   Okay, that could cut sleep apnea means you don't you don't breathe properly it when you're sleeping at night
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.120]   Uh, which means you can be very tired during the day thinking exactly good night's sleep
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.280]   Have you ever had a sleep test? I have not and I don't want to know
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:25.920]   I know i'm tired all the time, but I attribute it to my advanced age. Yeah, that's normal, right? Yeah
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.840]   Hey, you gotta love it kasey nice that
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.920]   Got a big pager. I watched I watched his vlog saying this is the last vlog i'm giving this up and then
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   Turns out it's for a big deal
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:45.840]   Estimated $25 million kasey a youtube star he's got millions of subscribers right i haven't checked his subscribers
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.400]   But i've watched his videos very talented
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.160]   Uh
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.920]   Really clever guy
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.560]   He does have 11 employees, so I always thought oh he's just a great editor he works really fast
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   But no he's got 11 people working for him
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.000]   Uh and he created an app called beam
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.240]   Which we actually had as an app cap on ios today. It was kind of cool
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880]   you put it on your phone
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.600]   and uh, it would you had to like tap your chest and then it would start taping
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.040]   It was kind of weird, but the idea was like very direct personal
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.280]   Broadcasting a lot of people another case where a lot of people downloaded it
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.360]   And then nobody used it after that including me
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:32.000]   Uh kasey is 35. He's got a great story. He's very talented a video editor
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.200]   Very talented, you know does a lot of kind of cool stuff in in new york city
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.040]   And he is now a cnn employee
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.240]   In fact the whole company all the beams employees will join cnn
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.200]   Beam was downloaded a million times so a million of the great hunt for youth and video. Yeah, right
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:58.480]   I think that's a smart move. It's a weird move though because normally what a company like cnn would do or my company is we'd approach them and say
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.640]   We'd like to hire you
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.720]   Right, but nowadays, uh, it's like we'd like to acquire your company
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.360]   Presumably it goes with a job though, right? He he gets 25 million and then a job. Yeah, he's yeah, he's he's
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.080]   Content visionary or some such thing. Yeah
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.920]   Beams employees earn out or something. Yeah, well, I guess no, they're shutting down beam so it's not it's not a
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.560]   No, there's no more beam app, but their employees will stick around in the trabeca office
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.880]   They're not going to move to the time Warner center good. That's smart nice stat
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.720]   Will still manage his personal youtube channel which has 5.8 million subscribers, but it's not related to his new media venture
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.840]   And as for whether nice stat will appear on cnn's tv lineup the networks that we're
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:46.720]   Exploring every possible way for kc in our media venture to connect with new audiences stay tuned the new wolf
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.680]   I asked karston to try to book
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.880]   My old colleague Alex well and who runs digital at cnn he's the
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.400]   He was he was one of our anchors on tech tv many moons ago great guy love Alex
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.720]   And he's at cnn I would I would i'm willing to bet was the guy who
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.840]   Helmed this acquisition
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.040]   And he any have you have you emailed him is he any yeah, we're waiting here. I think Alex still likes me
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.520]   You'll find out soon find out find out soon enough still if i'm still in his good graces
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.200]   um, oh
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.840]   We lost kevin before we got to do his uh, so oh he's back. Oh
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.360]   So, um, I looked like my dns went down on my main connection. So i'm now going in through my phone
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.760]   um
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.720]   Android hotspot you've been hacked. I'm not sure if i've been hacked, but it says dns failed on my
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:51.920]   That's not supposed to happen. No, so calm cast has probably eaten something. Yeah
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   Um, but I fully I can fall back on my but can you stick around or are you about to leave? I don't understand
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.640]   I need I didn't need to leave soon anyway. You came back just to say goodbye. Just say goodbye
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.400]   I was on a conference call today and somebody had problems their connection
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.280]   And she would just come into the conversation constantly saying oh, I i just me I left I came back
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280]   And then clunk
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.800]   And then clunk went off the other came back it was like a comedy routine was there all of her said was i'm on i'm back
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.800]   Gunk. Yeah, you hit your data cap. That's what happened
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.080]   Have you received a the an email from Comcast saying you've got
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.920]   You're approaching your data cap. I got one this month for the first time ever. I haven't had one of those but oh scary
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.800]   You have a terabyte. I went up. I went 125 over the terabyte. They said that's okay
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.320]   We'll spot you this time, but if it happens twice more, we're gonna have to charge you
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.040]   We we you broke asking for something?
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.520]   I was just watching tv, but I realized we watch
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.000]   Everything now we stream even if hbo
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:56.640]   You know is on the cable wouldn't cost us. We end up watching on an hbo go instead. I stream everything and I have
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.080]   Okay, that's what you do
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.600]   Yeah
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.680]   But i'm kessie. I they know
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.360]   Everybody said oh a terabyte you'll never hit a terabyte
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.080]   Well, you have 4k then you see how much the way we do 4k and 360
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.680]   Yeah
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.960]   Exactly
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.040]   Was it depends how much they compress the 4k the moment they're not compressing it much. No, it looks great
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.760]   I'm amazed because there is very little 4k content. There's only like 100 DVDs
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.640]   Although you see here youtube is now supporting
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:33.200]   4k live stream streaming live streaming live streaming wow and also in 360 degrees
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.680]   I don't know anybody who has a 360 degree 4k camera. That might be the ozo
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.560]   I don't even think the ozos 4k. Yeah, but all of us now have 4k camera as it can stream 4k, right?
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.200]   This is a 4k camera
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   Most many phones can do that
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.720]   So that's cool
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.560]   They they look good. I mean 4k. I I've been watching a 4k with hdr
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:04.400]   Um on Netflix and on amazon and it looks good. There's a you end up watching just
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.000]   I remember in the early days of hd you'd watch the stupidest stuff because it was a high def yeah
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   But don't you have to be like four inches from the screen to tell oh no you're gonna run over to my house
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.160]   Oh, no, but i'm not that i'm not i'm not i'm not huge i'm not way distant, but I have a so i have a
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.400]   65 inch screen so it's pretty big one of those curved things or no no I
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.840]   Had curved last year I had curved this year's straight
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.400]   And it's um i'm about uh eight feet
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.320]   Okay, and you feel like you're looking through a window. It's like wow
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.040]   So i'm watching a very stupid
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.320]   Show about japan
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   But it's in 4k and you're really
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.480]   Remember that's what mark Cuban made made money on right streaming hd bikini videos
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.440]   Oh god
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.640]   I don't think
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.880]   BBC earth in 4k that would be worth saying i pre-ordered it they're reshooting it
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.960]   Um, but it won't be out. Well, are they no they is out
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.680]   Right
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.920]   It's airing isn't it? Oh, he just we lost him again
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.920]   BB earth 2 and they've shot it all in 4k. Mm-hmm. Oh, and they're airing it on but they're are they airing it?
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.400]   America where are they airing it?
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.440]   Not sure bbc uk at the moment. Yeah, but I work because I ordered pre-ordered the dvd because that's how that's
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.760]   It'll be pbs here. You mean blue ray. I'm yeah. Yeah blue ray. No, no blue ray uhd
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.400]   I have a high def blue ray player. I mean a uh uhd
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.840]   4k blue ray player. Yeah, no, that's the way to watch it. Yeah. Oh
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:45.120]   I bought the hd when it came out and I had a new hd tv if it's beautiful love bbc earth
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.360]   I remember being yeah, you know, nobody's gonna need hd. That's silly. Oh
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.560]   No hd hd hd is a measurable difference 4 4k is tougher
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.560]   I mean a 4k screen is great if you're actually using it for text and work and and you want you know, Kevin come to my house
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:07.920]   And watch this this movie this japanese movie with me you will be blown away. I promise you've never seen anything look better
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.200]   Oh, okay. I mean it's but the but
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:17.440]   Me is like the tv in our house isn't that big and the room's fairly big so right 720p is fine with the what we watch it
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to have the viewing of our I set it up to be you know
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.560]   Close because I want to see you know and I'm you want to be immersive. Yeah, it is immersive. It's in cinematic
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.720]   It's better than what going on the movies
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.880]   Yeah, hey, I forgot to mention we were talking about echo amazon is going to apparently according to mark german good source
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.480]   Bloomberg technology do a premium Alexa speaker with a screen on it. They say it's for your kitchen
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.360]   Uh first as soon as first quarter 2017 I would wait for this
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.800]   I've been waiting for amazon to start capitalizing on the on the election
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.200]   I mean this the thing we talked about you know for a while
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   It's is and it's part of the thing that google makes sense because you can have the chrome cars in the tv
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.560]   And you can have the google gadget you talk to and it can sense after the chrome cars
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.840]   Which is what you want so alexa doing that makes sense but having a screen in it makes less sense to me than
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.640]   You know sending it to the amazon fire or whatever their equipment is well and they're gonna do sonos
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   Well, I think that's what the screen will be right as a fire tablet. What do you what are you bad?
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.960]   yeah
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.720]   Or but but a fire dongle thing you stick in your actual tv because you got the tv cool that would be cool
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:29.040]   No, that's that's that's that's the thing that that's the promise of the google one is that you can say okay google
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.640]   Play me bbc earth and it goes it's in it's in google movies. Do you want to spend?
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.720]   You know ten bucks on it you say sure and then it appears on your tv. I haven't tried that yet
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.040]   Does that work now?
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:47.680]   I don't know. I haven't got the you know, I haven't got the gadget but that that's that's the thing the thing that the chrome cars makes possible is that
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.520]   You know you can you can send stuff to any of the screens in your house
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.160]   The thing that potentially the the speaker that knows where your things in your house
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:56.640]   Oh
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.880]   Means you can say play with the movie and it'll play it to the right screen in the right room
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.120]   I've named all my crowcast so I should theoretically be able to say play me the movie in the living room
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.880]   Right. I have a chrome cast named the 4k crow cast cramp cast is named man cave
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:18.400]   I can't wait. I can't wait to say play the kini videos in my man cave
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.120]   That's gonna be awesome
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.040]   This is where it misages you and since it's somewhere else in the house instead
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.720]   GoPro in trouble. We've known that GoPro was struggling
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   I'm not sure if it's that there's too many competitors or that people are getting weaned off of the action camera category
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.120]   It reminds me of the great flip cam
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:49.840]   But that just died suddenly didn't it remember that boy who fought that was the thing first for vloggers
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.360]   I was I loved it. I I I discovered it. I introduced media companies to what I said is going to change the world
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.400]   But you know what killed that was the smartphone right the ability to do the same thing on the same
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:07.920]   Phone you already have and I would guess that's kind of what's killing GoPro is that we've got great cameras on our phones. I don't know
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.160]   15 percent of its workforce will be laid off there to shut down the entertainment
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.000]   Division
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.240]   Well, they seem to be in charge of the world. Wow
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:23.600]   They're restructuring to reduce operating expenses by 650 million dollars next year
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.720]   They estimate they'll incur as much as 33 million dollars in restructuring costs
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.080]   Products including the karma drone and the new hero five have
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.960]   Not sold well the company blamed the disappointing results on production problems. They had to recall 2500 drones
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.400]   It also faces a class action lawsuit
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.880]   that claims the company made false and misleading statements about the drone
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.520]   Which is a violation of federal securities law? Wow
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.240]   Competition but I mean but I think also a weakening market
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.400]   And here's the best news of all netflix now lets you download their content to watch offline
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:14.400]   Now I this was this was this made made the rundown worth it for me this week. Yeah, who I'm very happy
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.720]   Now it's not everything it's mostly original stuff, but boy, that's great. That's the stuff I want. That's the best stuff on Netflix right on the plane. Yeah
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.840]   Uh, I just I haven't finished the crown yet. That'd be perfect
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.280]   I like to just all kinds of stuff. I didn't watch it all because because if I can't watch it on the plane or in the subway
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.960]   Yeah, um
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.600]   So here's here's the question for you. Are you either of you walking dead fans? No
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.440]   Okay, I had to stop watching it's it's dystopia
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.160]   Everybody stopped watching now the the ratings for the walking dead have plummeted
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.480]   Oh, it just got so disgusting. I couldn't I couldn't do it. Yeah. Well proves you can go too. Fodistic. Yeah
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:58.960]   And and and really just does is I watch tv to escape from dystopia and we're in dystopia
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   Right
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.760]   You know, so well that's what some have said is that get ready because you're going to see a stream of feel good movies
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.600]   Just this is happening to the great depression. Yeah, right? You're we're gonna have it buzzby burkley tap dancing singing
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.160]   Happy go lucky
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.120]   Escapist movies. I do note when I go to the theater
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.880]   A ton of sci-fi movies all of a sudden
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:28.880]   Last year was the comic book character the marvels the marvel universe year this year's gonna be the spaceship saga
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.640]   The space opera year
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.440]   tons of stuff
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.200]   What by the way, uh, what do you think of the crown? Have you watched that kevin? What's your a british citizen?
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.400]   Or is that one yet? I watched a bit of victoria, but I haven't watched it. I didn't finish that one. I wanted to know
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.840]   It's the same guy to the queen which I thought was wonderful. I'm just curious
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.280]   But I haven't watched it so I could have a opinion on that yet. I've been well. I've been binge watching vikings that that that I was
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.360]   Is that good? Well, it's very good. Oh, I'll have to watch that. That's I think in 4k uHD. So I can enjoy that there you go
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.840]   I'm looking at that. I was impressed with it. It's um
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.240]   It has that game of throwing thing, but actually there's a bunch of historical stuff in it. It's accurate
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.920]   Okay, so when they do people speaking of funny languages, they're actually speaking
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.040]   Old Danish and Old English. Oh, that's nice
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.200]   And you need some mythical stuff and bits and pieces. I knew that old Danish degree would come in handy someday
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.960]   No, I was I was laughing. I was because I went to game which and I had friends who did anglo sachs and norse miltic
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.960]   Fun day you want to join me? Yeah, get a good job
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.880]   So right the dialogue for actors to learn language and they can't speak there. Spiegel loses again

[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:23.360]   Um, so you don't have to to poll a feed or check for updates and this is a protocol that's been around since um 2010
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.880]   But it's now a w3c working draft. We've done it's part of the social web working group. Nice. Um, and
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   You know, it's still it's still use in quite widespread ways and it's being adopted by the newer thing
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.800]   So masterton dot social which then if you've seen yet, which is one yet another twitter alternative
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.000]   Um uses pub sub hubbub as as part of its protocol
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.320]   And we're using it in the indie web to make sure that when you post something other people can see it quickly
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.680]   So you can do the the kind of real time back and forth that you get with
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.960]   Um, twitter or facebook without actually being tied into one one star left. What is the new uh twitter?
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.120]   It's not good news social or something else
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.080]   Um, it's masterton dot social which is it's it's good is going to social compatible
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.920]   But it's a new implementation that someone's just built masterton as in the uh, willie mammas. Yes, master. Oh, don
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.080]   master. Oh, don
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.040]   Free open source social network server, etc. Cool
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.440]   Hmm. So that's that's that's that's just popped up over that sort of ramped up
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   I think he started it a couple of months ago and it's it picked up some traction in the last few weeks
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.760]   Awesome. Um, but he's using pub sub hubbub and some of these, um, these specs as well. Nice
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.000]   Thank you kevin marks. I you know, we got kevin on at the last minute because uh, stacey
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.760]   Fell ill so uh, not a seriously ill but she just couldn't make it so
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.240]   Thank you for coming in at the last minute and i'm sorry. We have to lose you so fast, but it's been great having you
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.360]   Bye. I'll see you again soon. See you soon
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.440]   I am joining mastodon right now
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.000]   Uh-huh. Uh-huh
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.160]   Let's see real quickly before we uh before we get our picks of the week anything else to talk about
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.760]   Yeah, let's put the stuff here stay c's in along
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.640]   This article which I also noted
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.120]   Google amp is a gilded cage
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.880]   It's kind of what i've been saying, right?
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.040]   Uh, no, you'd like that one where do you stand on this now now that we've seen what amp is and and all of that
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.200]   I don't think we've seen the full impact yet until google
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.880]   Basically links everything it links to his amp
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.720]   So the idea was we're going to speed up the web. We're going to get rid of the worst ad tech
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.440]   uh, we're going to let publishers
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.520]   Uh publish articles that load almost instantly on your mobile browser
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   And we're going to make it kind of an open project that anybody can run an amp server. Although I don't see anybody doing that
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.760]   Nope, um and the and this article from taren's eden is not so much a criticism of amp
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.520]   It's just saying if you made the mistake of trying out amp on your website
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.040]   It's pretty hard to get out of it. Yeah, that's really good. He had the you know,
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.360]   wordpress makes it easy. There's a wordpress plugin
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.400]   He uh, uninstalled the wordpress plugin
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.200]   And google continues to show
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.440]   amp links, which of course because he's not running the the plugin anymore
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.320]   Oops gives him a 500 error
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.600]   and even if they try to click through
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.680]   He they get a 404 error. Yeah
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.640]   So, uh, this probably is something google would fix. I would imagine
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.000]   Don't fix it
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.440]   It is a weakness in the amp architecture that that you have a different url
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.400]   Yeah, as opposed to a new standard
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.840]   Yeah
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.280]   I don't know. I mean it hasn't turned out to be a horrible thing either
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.880]   And I have to say anything that makes pages load faster is a good thing
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.200]   It's a good thing. Yeah
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.960]   So i'm amused by the fact that facebook eraser sucks post about
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.040]   fake news
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.000]   That was an accident too. I presume. Yeah, sure sure
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.040]   But why did they erase it because they their fake news censors said it. Oh, it's fake news
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:04.400]   Yeah, I think you can't you can't avoid the straight line. I sense fake news
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.920]   What was he saying? We're gonna get rid of fake news probably. No, you're not
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:15.840]   Yeah, it was it was the one where he said 99% of the stuff on on facebook is authentic. No wrong
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840]   Right
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.840]   So i was amused by that. I thought that was
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.000]   You are wrong mark snooker hug
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.360]   You are blocked
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.680]   I'm what are you using assistant on the pixel?
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.120]   Very very little but you know it's probably my head with all of these things
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.280]   But I use it when I want to find a factual thing
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.360]   I will use it. Mm-hmm. I have a google home too and I don't talk to it that much
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.320]   I talked to
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.280]   I learned to talk to the echo because it does a few things that I really like like reads to me plays music
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   Uh that kind of thing
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.960]   Um, and I think that's the problem with all speech interfaces, you know, I have quirtana on this windows machine
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.480]   And I know it's you have to kind of be trained to use it
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:02.800]   You know, that's why it's interesting that amazon is adding the screen back to speech because you want to be able to see the page
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.640]   I think it's good for I don't know if it's gonna work, but I think it's good for media brands potential. No, that's true
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.520]   That's true. We yeah
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.000]   we a few weeks ago added
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   uh
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.920]   twit bits to
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.920]   the morning briefing that the echo does and uh, we got pretty good take up
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:29.360]   I think the last time I saw was 5,000 people were listening to bits from our shows mostly as the news from tnt money through
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.000]   Friday and then bits from the screen savers and uh
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.120]   Twit on their on their echo as part of their morning briefing, which is thank you everybody
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.440]   And if you'd like to do that you just open that app. I don't want to use the name, but the oh the a app
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.360]   the amazon echo app and uh search for twit in the morning briefing contents
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.280]   They've really expanded the kinds of things you can get in the morning briefing, which has made it a lot better
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.680]   Lot better and yeah, we've tried to keep those down in a couple of minutes. So you get a quick hit of tech stuff
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.440]   Snapchat spectacles are they gonna be a big deal?
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.360]   No
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:09.920]   No, but I'm sure you wish you had a pair. No, not at all for the fun of it. No, no, no, it's a gimmick
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.920]   I never use it. I'd be blind because it's not
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.920]   Preshupion. Well, you had google glass. I mean, they'll re-enter remind me
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.960]   It's just the same thing right you could take videos
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.520]   A lot cheaper
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.360]   It's a hundred twenty eight six bucks and less dorky looking
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.720]   Really
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:36.800]   You put this link to an op-ed piece in the New York Times by christopher tag at an auction that could transform local media
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   What's going on? So we have the spectrum auction coming or another one now
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:50.640]   Oh, it's in process now and it's a double blind Dutch with a double twist in the south cow and it's very complex extremely complex
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.560]   um
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.720]   But uh the new jersey
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.800]   Public media licenses that we believe are up for sale could be worth as much as two billion dollars
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.720]   Wow, so christa again who's a friend of mine
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:08.560]   He has the foundation of on one the board of the purely in our dodge foundation wrote it op-ed with free press
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:14.960]   Also weighing in arguing that if let's say it's two billion dollars, why not a 10 percent?
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:22.640]   Fund to help develop the future of media and inform society in new jersey 200 million dollars could go a long way
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.560]   to building new media efforts so otherwise the money's just going to go right into
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560]   Solve governor traffic jams
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.800]   Does it go to the state? No, it doesn't even go to the stage. It just goes to federal budget
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.520]   No, no, no, no. No, that's the point
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.520]   The state owned the licenses
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:48.560]   Oh state selling them. I get it state selling in most of these cases these licenses are commercial and will go to abcmbc whoever
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.600]   But in this case, there are three licenses that were owned by the state of new jersey
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.240]   Public tv licenses
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.440]   Exactly
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.160]   And so there's there's a few cases like this around the country and so they're selling them and they can be worth quite a bit
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:07.760]   And we're just saying don't that's a one-time asset sale and don't have that money
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.880]   It's not and it's our money. Yep
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.000]   That's a little irritating to me that this the sale's going on and most of this money
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.440]   Billions dollars is going to go to tv stations and they don't even using it
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.640]   It's it's our airwaves and they should be given back to us the people, but that's not what's happening
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.040]   um
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.040]   So anyway, I try thank you for the plug to that. I wanted to mention this is certain irony to
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.240]   the fact that
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:41.280]   People didn't vote in the election because they felt that government wasn't responsive
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.760]   And was corrupted politicians were horrible and evil and as a result
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.640]   You ain't seen nothing yet. Yeah
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.320]   It's a little irate itself a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.680]   Mm. I'm trying to restrain myself. I know you're being very good
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.800]   And not now I'm the one who falling into the the pit because it's just you have to talk about it
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:13.040]   It's just hard not to yeah, yeah, I mean I'm still of the opinion that I've taken a little bit of a wait and see although
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:19.200]   We're starting to see but uh, I'm just curious. I still believe that the uh the institutions
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.560]   of of our republic will
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:30.080]   moderate any extremism on on the part of anybody. I mean some study in me most right now is
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.520]   um
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.320]   Insurance health insurance pre-existing conditions
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.640]   I know you know, he's already said I'm not gonna get rid of that. He said he has about I'm nervous
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.320]   I know he's got a new hhs secretary who is a day. It has been a
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   virulent
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.000]   foe of abomacure
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.480]   Yeah, so that's not worries me at an individual level. Yeah, um should you know because you have a pre-existing conviction
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.960]   The photos of of of romney dining with trump the captioning that's been going on is just hilarious
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.560]   My favorite is oh good a new season of twin peaks
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:09.840]   It I think that we're gonna see an amazing I think sometimes
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.560]   um
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:21.440]   If everything's going your way there's there's it's it kind of kills creativity. I think sometimes adversity is a very
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.160]   useful thing for
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:31.360]   The left. Yeah, I mean I'm getting a lot of flashbacks to the 60s. This is the weirdest picture ever. I know it's so hilarious. Sorry. I should have warned you
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.120]   Yeah
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.560]   And of course people are captioning this like crazy. Oh, yeah, yeah
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.560]   I didn't know that the zhajors is a wonderful amazing restaurant three star michalin
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.600]   Zhajors was rock director. I didn't know it was in a trump building
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.560]   So he he's up for the 21 club. You read the things all he evidently likes trump is cheeseburgers
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:57.200]   Yeah, I wonder what he's eating there. I mean it looks like it looks like mitts got something of interest
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.800]   But trump's got a looks like a taco bowl. I don't know what he's eating there
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.680]   We know he likes those
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:09.120]   Some very funny tweets
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:16.160]   It does look like a twilight zone episode where the where a guy just made a foolish deal with the devil that's adam mary said tweet
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.560]   Okay, um
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:31.200]   Although I think we can all be happy that uh president elect trump has convinced carrier the air conditioning company to keep
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:37.200]   A thousand jobs. It was about to send to mexico and uh, so I just tweeted a good fortune piece that
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.600]   Explained the deal. Yeah
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.840]   And says basically they lost kept a thousand jobs lost 1,100 jobs
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:50.800]   Um, there's a $700,000 a year state of indiana tax break to them and a couple other things
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.960]   Trump argued that you're gonna make more money from all my tax breaks. I'm gonna give companies
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.760]   You should stay
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:04.400]   And then one analysis says the real the carriers real fear was losing federal contracts, right

[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.600]   I can't even believe they were advertising on bright bar in the first place. I can't either

[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.600]   Somebody said well
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.680]   Look at the kelogs in a horrible position because no liberal is going to admit eating fruit loops
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.200]   So I had a tweet that lists all of kelogs brands and people are
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.920]   Are what they eat all brand
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.880]   There's some good stuff in there
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   Gilmore was looking for something healthy and I said he's not allowed to tell me that cheeses aren't healthy
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.200]   Eggo waffles

[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.360]   James o'Malley if gizmo knows said finally the american left has its own chick-fil-a campaign
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:42.320]   So it's fun to watch it watch a meme from the birth. It's yeah, it's amazing. We're so good at spreading this stuff
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:47.040]   I feel like uh, Neil uh postman was right. We are amusing ourselves to death
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.040]   And this is the the final stages of the death throes
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:55.600]   Jay rosons mentor really. Oh, I didn't know that yeah, yeah
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.840]   Um

[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.360]   Instead of a monoculture
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.080]   Uh, the the website meetings are on a regular basis

[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.120]   Oh a little beer and brats
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.760]   You're uh, your number of the week
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.400]   so all right, so um
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.920]   One fun one, uh, just serious the serious one first
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.680]   So there's a lot of talk obvious about fake news and and
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.200]   I have a couple issues with this. I just want to
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.960]   Put on the record
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.440]   One is that a lot of things are getting thrown into the fake news bucket that I don't think are fake news
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.040]   We talked about this last week. There was a blacklist that included the onion and private eye
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.520]   You see that's fine. It is not fake news. It's comedy. No, and I can buy democrats
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.640]   Even though they're not journalistic and they've done something's wrong. They're not fake news
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.360]   They're partisan and partisanship is not fake partisanship is being a citizen is having an opinion
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.000]   So I'm gonna be very careful of this
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.120]   But the other thing that that's why I've been against from the very beginning this idea of let's come clobber fake news because I yeah
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.960]   It worries me
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.040]   Let's let's get more truth more facts. Yeah, it's been today more facts may be bad
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.880]   but
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.640]   I generally believe more facts are good. So but what also struck me too is so
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.240]   The courts did an analysis of traffic to these
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.680]   Allegedly fake news and hyper partisan news sites web traffic
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:53.440]   Well, the thing about my democrats lesson. I learned my interview them is that the web track they make money on the web traffic
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   But it's otherwise meaningless
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.880]   The there's a lesson here for big media and the lesson for big media is use the same devices
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.840]   Yes, do the same things make memes make them truth bullets add journalism in get into the middle of people's conversation
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.760]   So I just wanted to make that point on a number of things and now to a more fun number
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.480]   Ariana Huffington long who left loving to post a couple months ago
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.080]   launched her new company thrive
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:28.080]   Uh pretty much today thrive clothing and she has she's selling things. She's including a $100 bid for your phone. Oh, please
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.520]   Oh Ariana
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.440]   What the what that's doping place of two colors
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.320]   Is do you have to assemble it like your ikea furniture exactly I was I'm thinking a hundred bucks
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:45.200]   Wow
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.480]   That is we have i'm telling you it's end times. It's the end times
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.760]   Sleep well after years in that. Yeah, Nero is fiddling while your phone is sleeping on its little bed
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.760]   Jeez
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.920]   Sometimes I wonder
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.800]   So she has a muse brain sensing headband
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.120]   Uh, she also has
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:12.240]   Jeff Bezos writing for her what
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:18.320]   Why getting eight hours of sleep is good for amazon shareholders. Oh lord
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:24.640]   Is this thrive dot com towards an interview a q&a thrive global thrive global dot com
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.720]   Yes
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.320]   Well being wisdom wonder why do you think she left the huff po
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.560]   I
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.120]   I don't know. I suspect a lot of it was
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.160]   Just the politics of of you know a walburizing. Yeah, um
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.200]   But I you know I wrote a piece
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.240]   Last year a year ago now saying come back Ariana come back that we need you in american politics
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.720]   We've lost your voice who stopped trying to be Oprah
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.160]   And and she don't know why I couldn't be both I can be both but she left politics almost entirely aside
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.000]   And I don't know if that was core. I've never known. I'm my guess is it was corporate
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.080]   Um
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:06.080]   Here's by the way another piece about sleep apparently thrive is gonna be about sleeping well
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.320]   This one's oh, it's by sheryl sandberg
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.720]   like
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.600]   Lean into your bed lean into your phone bed
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.680]   She's definitely pulling all of her uh
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.080]   Pulling all of her context. Here's a marie condo article
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.360]   By the way thrive is publishing its articles on medium
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.720]   Why wouldn't you?
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.800]   F's gonna do well with medium I think
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.000]   Marie condo is the tidy expert
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.960]   So
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.960]   Some would say tidy nut
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.720]   Yeah, and the stuff they're selling is just ridiculous
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.160]   So it's a sleep blog
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.920]   All right, my tip for you is congratulate mike elgin because he is a grandpa
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.800]   monday
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.480]   Is a son kevin elgin and uh wife?
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.680]   Nadia had a baby girl
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.360]   Unnamed
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.880]   At least as of that post now one reason I saw that post is because of my tip
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.880]   If you're on the face it's harder to do this on mobile, but if you're on the facebook
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:22.640]   Website click that little drop down arrow next to newsfeed and you could choose top stories or
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.240]   chronological stories and I have here's another here's a meme
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.320]   Uh, I have to say chronological well looks like there's only one post in my chronological feed
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.960]   So that's a lousy tip that but
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.760]   Viewing them chronologically brings back all those posts that were algorithmically
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.880]   Algorithmically being dumped from your facebook feed is it still complete or is it a chronological?
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.080]   Well, that's a good question. It's always been my understanding
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.560]   That it's good to be on the right you had way what happened to the right column used to be there
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.120]   ah
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:05.280]   I think facebook's having some some issues maybe there used to be a column on the on the wrong
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.480]   No way on the right here the full feed
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:13.360]   No, no, no. No, yeah, you have to go to newsfeed and and uh
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.120]   Chronological view most recent and that way though
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.120]   It seems to me that way you get all the all the stuff because the minute you go to
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.840]   the uh top news
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.960]   You lose half the stuff that you're seeing in the chronological
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.560]   So just seems to me
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.120]   That's the way to do it
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a brief but I think quite enlightening this week in google
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.520]   You see it's stasis the the blabbermouth slows us down
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.960]   No, just kidding
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.440]   We do Stacy. We hope you feel better. Yeah, poor stacey
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:56.320]   She had got a got a last minute migraines, but she'll be better. I'm sure by next week. We'll get her back in the in the fold
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.080]   Mean as you could find stacey at stacey and iot.com
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.920]   Stacey higginbotham and of course jeff you'll find it buzz machine.com. That's where he blogs and on medium
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.440]   Are you writing much these days? It feels like you kind of back as much you kind of maybe just sitting back and watching and ruminating
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.240]   Are you just busy teaching?
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.560]   All that and mediums and travel and yeah
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.760]   Yeah, I like your blog post that don't stop don't stop posting. Yes, sir. Yes, sir
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.400]   I like it when you're angry
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.320]   In fact others don't others don't of course they don't but that's
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.840]   Look at twitter is full of people who don't like anything
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:42.240]   It's a it's an outrage machine. So you shouldn't post on twitter and then pay attention to what people say about your posts on twitter
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.040]   That's crazy
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.920]   And the thing I like about you jeff is you do post a lot on twitter. So if you follow i
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.080]   I also
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.760]   I haven't read the post i want to write i've been thinking about writing this is that is that you know
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.880]   I've talked about a lot because I on this in this election I chose to go full bore in yes
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.320]   Was that a conscious it was a conscious choice very much. Yeah, but i've had opinions for years
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.880]   But a columnist on the blogger so the opinions been out there for years and i've been open about that but i went for the rent
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.560]   um
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.600]   And and and it meant that it meant something different to me and i'm reclaiming my citizenship and with it
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:24.080]   i'm feeling emotions and anger which i guess makes me more empathetic to the anger of other americans
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.520]   Uh, and it's hard to tamp it down sometimes. Yeah
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.840]   Well in my opinion
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.320]   Uh
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.240]   We need both we need reportage fact-based reportage
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.120]   and we need
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.360]   Uh people's opinions
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:47.600]   And as long as they're both labeled clearly, I don't have too much trouble with either
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.800]   In fact, even one person can do both
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:58.160]   I just don't like it when it's mixed my reportage is mixed with opinion. Yes hard for me. Then that's that's what's going to distinguish
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.800]   Do you have my kelghan news?
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.520]   Did I have it?
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.560]   Yes, well i just see it on my facebook feed. No, that's what i was just saying that was like that he had a grandchild
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:12.800]   Yeah, you have a picture of you should have heard. Yes, you must have passed out during that moment
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.000]   That was my point you you sent me to change the feed now was changing the feed
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.160]   Oh, you're busy changing the feed and and that's the first thing you saw as my kelghan had a grandchild
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:27.200]   Now I remember the side of my eyes princess squishy face. They don't have a that's a name for her
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:34.960]   Like it's gonna be a good grandfather. I am thrilled for him except the sad thing is he was staying in the united states
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:42.160]   Until the baby was born now i'm afraid we'll have lost him to his digital nomad lifestyle. I think that baby can hold on to him
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.120]   Yeah, you know what maybe
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.120]   You might be right
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.360]   Jeff always a pleasure have a wonderful evening

[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.680]   Uh staff and hosts time off
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.720]   So what we do is we um put together the best moments
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.200]   From the previous year and we'd love your help in doing that
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:11.040]   You know it says in the submissions, you know things like air date time into episode where in the episode why what
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.280]   Happened just fill in whatever you can
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.480]   You know you don't have to give us any of that stuff
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   Uh, why do we require their name? Oh to thank them

[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:44.080]   When leo stood on the table and it broke you could put that and would that would help us
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.600]   So ignore the required. I don't even know why it's there
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.800]   Take the asterisks off
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.160]   Any help it all would be wonderful, but here's the one thing that is required. It should be from the year 2016
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.440]   Otherwise, it won't be the best of this year
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:06.160]   And then we'll see those episodes the day from christmas day through new year's day something like that the uh the week after christmas
