date=2009

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.680]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.680]   This is Twig this week in Google, episode three,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.680]   for August 15, 2009.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.120]   There's a command line for that.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.840]   This show is brought to you by listeners like you
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   and your contributions.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.880]   Thanks so much.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.680]   It's time for this week in Google and joining us.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.920]   A wonderful group, as always, starting with Gina Trapani
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.680]   of a smarterware.org, former founder of Life Hacker,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.600]   and a wonderful person who obviously rides a bike.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.320]   Howdy.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.040]   Because the bike is behind her in the image.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.880]   Yeah, I actually took it out this morning.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.280]   It doesn't just hang on my wall.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.920]   Hey, that's great.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.640]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   Great commentator on journalism and all things new media.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.720]   Great to have you once again, Jeff.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   Always happy to be here.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   Bird time.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.240]   Third time?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.760]   Well, the plan is to have you on every show.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.400]   But if you tire of it, let me know.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   And for the first time, a fourth around the table,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   Anil Dash, who was vice president at Six Apart,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.040]   writes an amazing blog.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.320]   We've quoted now in both episodes of This Week in Google
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.240]   at dashesdashes.com.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.320]   Hi, Anil.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.820]   Hello.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.840]   I'm really excited to be here with you.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   Great to have you.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.360]   Anil's a great observer of this whole scene.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.040]   Of course, Six Apart is one of the big movers in this scene.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.320]   But you've been around for a long time blogging since 1999,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.840]   longer than any of us.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.360]   I guess so.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   Yeah, 10 years.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.560]   It's time flies.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.320]   Gina was telling me that she and Jeff
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.960]   started their blog in 2001.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.000]   I did too.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.520]   So--
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.680]   It was a good year for blogging.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.840]   I guess it was.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.040]   And you've been doing it since 1999, 10 years.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.680]   That's amazing.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.160]   So before we get into the meat of the matter,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760]   I thought I would bring up one thing that was blog post.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.320]   It's a little bit personal.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   Jeff Jarvis's blog post.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.600]   Jeff, you reveal on your blog that you have prostate cancer.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Right.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.440]   The doctor said that if you're going to get cancer,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   this is the one to get.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480]   So I feel as if I got the upgrade on cancer error.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.240]   But it was very early.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   I'm very lucky.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   I know it.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.000]   And living the public life that we all do,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.200]   how could I do anything else but blog it?
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.800]   I had to.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   Well, no, you didn't have to.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   But I think it is true.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960]   We live in public, don't we?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.320]   There's such benefit that comes out of it.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.400]   I've got an incredible outpouring of support and advice
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.800]   from friends and from people who have had the procedure.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.880]   And the only one nut came out from the result.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.560]   So it's not bad.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.080]   You lost a nut?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   I only--
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.800]   No.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.840]   You had the Lance Armstrong version, eh?
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.160]   We hope not.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.880]   Why, because I will lose.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   I apologize.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.000]   But I'm going to lose.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.600]   I have it totally, totally apologize.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.680]   So good.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.920]   So you'll have operation or will you have treatment?
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.440]   So I hope to not miss a single show, by God.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.560]   I'll be here.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.480]   You won't want to know what's below the camera,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   but everything will be fine.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.760]   They called Walter Cronkite old Iron Pants,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   because he never missed an episode.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.760]   We'll have to come up with a similar name for Jeff.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.600]   Old Iron Ball.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.360]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.360]   I'm going to cut it out right now.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.760]   I'm still--
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.440]   No, wait a minute.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   That's wrong too.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.320]   Let's move on, shall we?
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.280]   There is a lot of news.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   You know, it's funny when I first started thinking
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.520]   about doing a show like this, I thought, well,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.320]   will there be enough Google news?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.800]   Ah!
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.520]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.800]   There's never any lack of news about Google.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   And of course, this show is not--
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.960]   and Gina was very quick to make sure of it, not just
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.480]   about Google, but it's about cloud computing as well.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.680]   So we cover Google and the cloud.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.560]   And while there's been a lot of Google news,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.640]   I think maybe the big news of the week
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.800]   is that Facebook bought Friend Feed on Monday.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.040]   What do you guys think of that?
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.440]   And let's start with a Neil, our guest.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.160]   Give him the pride of place.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.720]   I think it's interesting.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   I'll have to be honest.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.840]   I never used Friend Feed that much.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   I kind of felt like I got Facebook in my life.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.320]   I've got Twitter.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.760]   I got a million other services.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.840]   It's kind of overkill.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   But the idea of aggregating all of my different services
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.840]   together is really, really appealing.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.240]   And I think Friend Feed got such a great pedigree from day one
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.400]   because of the people that made it.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.080]   These were really talented folks that came from Google,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   came from elsewhere in the industry that
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.760]   had an amazing background.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.880]   So that, I think, gave Friend Feed perhaps an elevated place
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.800]   that they might not have had otherwise.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   And people were rooting for them.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.400]   So I think it's interesting to think now all the conversation
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.680]   again is we tend to think about the technology.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.840]   We tend to think about how are they going to integrate
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.160]   these different pieces and the cool features that they have.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.200]   But I can't help but feel this is the same story it was day one.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's like these are people that have good ideas.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.320]   And that's why Facebook wanted them.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.360]   Smart engineers are always valuable.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   Yeah, Paul and his partner-- and I
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.560]   forgotten his name-- started-- wrote Gmail, right?
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.680]   I think the reason Friend Feed is important--
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.440]   it's not important because of its size.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.040]   I was a big Friend Feed fan, but I
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.520]   know there aren't very many of us.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.840]   But the reason it was important is because they
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.680]   seem to get social media in a way that Twitter and others,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.280]   including Facebook, didn't.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.880]   And I think that's probably why Facebook was interested,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.720]   although I have to wonder what does Facebook want to do
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.280]   with these guys.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.040]   Jeanette, do you have a thought on it?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.200]   It's interesting.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.080]   I mean, I would love to see Friend Feed's aggregation
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.440]   capabilities show up in Facebook.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.720]   And I think Anil just said earlier
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.360]   that this kind of makes Facebook or gives them
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.680]   the ability to become sort of a widget company.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.320]   I don't know.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   I just recently got into Friend Feed because of Uleo, really,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.440]   because we've been doing the Twig stuff on Friend Feed.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I love you.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.920]   Well, it's a really interesting service.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.840]   I didn't really have a need for it before either.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.640]   What struck me about it the last couple weeks I've been using
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.960]   it is it's pretty geeky.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.240]   I mean, it took me a little bit to Grocket,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.560]   which is going to be kind of interesting to see how they
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.440]   integrate certain features that I didn't quite get right
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.320]   away into Facebook.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.880]   Maybe I'm just daft.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.840]   But a couple-- and one other comment that I heard was,
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.400]   how are-- how is Friend Feed's real time features
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.520]   and their feature set going to scale on Facebook?
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.640]   That'll be interesting to see.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.120]   But I don't know.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.720]   Maybe kind of sad.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.360]   I'm not a huge fan of Facebook.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, it's OK, but I definitely get much more value out
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   of Twitter.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.880]   And I've been really liking Friend Feed as well.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.800]   So I'm not sure if-- maybe I just need to manage my Facebook
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.320]   life a little more aggressively or something.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.280]   Jeff, you're a big Facebook user.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   You support Facebook.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.520]   I have been.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.960]   I think the irony here is that Facebook stumbled upon lower
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.800]   case as slower case you.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.280]   The notion of the live web in what they did.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.520]   And the news feed that was controversial when Zuckerberg
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.480]   first did it, of course, became the spine of Facebook.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.000]   And I don't know whether it inspired Twitter in any way,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.760]   but Twitter really kind of follows in as a stepchild of the
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.400]   news feed at Facebook.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.320]   But Facebook then fell behind in the live web.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.360]   And so the irony is they had to catch up somehow where their
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   Friend Feed can do that for them or not.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.480]   I don't know.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.200]   On the wiki, I put a link up to--
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   who was it?
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.680]   Kevin Marks did a great post today trying to analyze the
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.280]   success of Twitter.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.640]   And he goes into a lot of things about the flow of the web.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.360]   There's no kind of email backup constipation for us.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.800]   The notion of publics and following.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.360]   The notion of control of your society and the web.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.040]   And so all of that, if you think about it, Twitter was
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.840]   very early on to it.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.400]   I mean, Facebook was very early on to it, but they try to be
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.040]   25 things at once.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.920]   And Twitter was so simple that I think they lost the
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.600]   focus and maybe Friend Feed can bring that back.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.520]   It is an acknowledgment that the real-time web, or the live
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.480]   web, as you call it, is something that's happening
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.360]   and something important, isn't it?
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.320]   I mean, isn't that what Friend Feed is, is the real-time
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.920]   web?
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.840]   And that's the thing that Google, since this is Twig,
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.280]   isn't very good at.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.120]   And so Google, at some point, I think is going to have to buy
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.080]   one of these players because they don't understand, though
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.560]   one of the founders has said that he wanted to search the
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.760]   entire web every second.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.880]   And that sounded absurd.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.520]   I think we're headed that way.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   That's a really interesting differentiation, because what
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.160]   I heard from it from Friend Feed was not so much just the
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   real-time stream or what Dave Weiner calls the River of News,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.800]   but much more of the aggregation.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.720]   It was assuming that if you used Friend Feed, you probably
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.800]   used half a dozen web services, not one.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.920]   And Friend Feed brought them all together for you.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.160]   Yeah, and I think that was as important as the real-time
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.640]   element.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.600]   I think the idea--
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   I mean, the thing I keep obsessing over is the biggest
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.120]   social network is the web itself.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.360]   And we're so used to thinking of, I'm on this network or I'm
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.520]   on that network.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.840]   And Friend Feed, to me, felt like accepting the reality of
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   we're not choosing one, we're choosing all of the above.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.240]   And yet, the thing that is sticky about Friend Feed, at
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.760]   least, was for me, is not that I can port everything in there,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.480]   but the engagement and conversation that results from
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   that.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.160]   And I think that makes sense that this is what Friend
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.520]   Facebook is looking for.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.440]   It seems to me that Facebook is trying to change it--
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.680]   and this is a difficult thing to do.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.800]   I mean, it really is built around a walled garden, private
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   model.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840]   There's no public face to Facebook.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.000]   You can't even Google Facebook entries.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.800]   And I think it looks like they're trying to create a public
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.280]   face and open the walled garden.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.720]   And in fact, when I look at what they did with CNN during the
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.520]   election, the CNN election page, which looked like a
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.680]   Facebook page, was actually a CNN page with Facebook widgets
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   on it.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   And it seems to me that's at least part of their strategy
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.080]   going forward.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.360]   It's a difficult proposition because everybody who's on
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.960]   Facebook right now expects privacy.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.360]   In fact, probably that's why most people joined Facebook is
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.480]   because it's not Google.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.200]   It's not public.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   It's a private conversation.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.000]   Can you make that transition from walled garden to
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.600]   public garden?
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.160]   Has anybody ever done that?
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.440]   Well, I think Google was trying to get with Kevin Marks there.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.840]   The irony is Kevin has left Google since.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.040]   But he was there.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.320]   He was looking at the open social efforts.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.680]   And I forget what they called there's "Friend Connect," right?
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.920]   "Leave your tricky tracks across the web and bring them in."
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.400]   Whether that was your Amazon reviews or your Twitter feed
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.160]   or your Facebook comments or your YouTube videos or whatever.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.680]   That adds up to us.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.800]   That my presence online is my avatar.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.680]   It is my life.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.720]   And I think that's where you really want to go.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.800]   Not at Facebook, but wherever I want it to be.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.120]   Right.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.840]   And I think that this is going to be where the battle lies is
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.000]   between Google and Facebook to become the--
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.960]   or do you think Google isn't going to be a social widget
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   marketer?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.040]   I mean, that's-- I think to me, that's a great strategy
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.480]   for Google.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.200]   What does Google want?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.080]   They want to be everywhere.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.680]   They want eyeballs everywhere, right?
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   I wonder why Kevin left because Kevin was doing great work
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.000]   with Fred.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.640]   I know.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.600]   And there is an opportunity to do something there.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.720]   I always say that Google has not won the entire world.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.400]   It's the live web, the social web, the local web,
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.040]   and the mobile web are still to be conquered.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.720]   And we'll see.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.200]   I think it's very likely everybody with a big network
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.960]   is going to try and turn it inside out.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.240]   And that's Google.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   That's certainly Facebook.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.000]   I mean, I think even the old school players,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.440]   if you look at the however many hundreds of millions of people
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.520]   have AOL and its domesticer account,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   I think all those networks are going
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.560]   to try to turn themselves inside out.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.120]   It would be a race to see who does it in a way that other sites
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.840]   actually won't eat.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.640]   And a lesson is AOL, which maintained a walled garden
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   and never really did open and look what happened to them.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.960]   Do you know, is friend-- now that you've
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.920]   started using friend feed a little bit,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.000]   is it kind of the cloudy use you've
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.640]   been talking about in terms of adding value
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.760]   to an otherwise existing API and feed?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.040]   You know, ever since I started my friend feed account,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.920]   which I did back in the day when I first heard about it,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.480]   I used it solely as an aggregator.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.920]   So for people who aren't into social media at all,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.360]   I could say, if you want to know everything
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.600]   that I'm doing on the web, just go to my friend feed account.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.720]   Because it's all there.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   You don't have to be in one pace or the other.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.960]   The functionality that I was not sure about,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.120]   I didn't realize that you could forward items to say,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.960]   like, the twig room, which I didn't realize you could do.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.680]   And the conversations are really interesting and cool.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.520]   I'm still not clear about where all of those comments
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.020]   come from.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.000]   I feel like some of them come from outside sources.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Some of them happen on friend feed.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.200]   You know, I'm not sure.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.700]   So--
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.120]   Friend feed-- you're right.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.680]   The likes can come from anybody.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.240]   The comments can come from anybody.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.000]   The posts are people you're following, or-- and this
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.920]   was a very interesting thing.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.720]   To me, Paul and company, the thing that Facebook got
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.840]   was they understood better than anybody, the nitty-gritty
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.720]   details of how to make these social graphs work.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.680]   They had a friend of a friend feature,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   where if a friend of yours liked something from somebody else,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.160]   it would also appear in your feed.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.080]   And it really helped in discovery.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.880]   They also have Search, which is something else Facebook,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.200]   I think, really wants and needs, and really
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.400]   where the money is, right, for Facebook.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.360]   I think Friend Feed is very engaging,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.400]   but it's very hard to understand and learn.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.360]   And I think, boy, I mean, if Gina,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.560]   if you didn't rock it right out of the box,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.680]   I don't know who would.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.200]   Yeah, I feel like I still don't get it.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.920]   There's this thing to aggregation that is just hard.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.120]   And I look at, like, 10 years ago, live journal
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.440]   had that ability.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   You had a Friends page.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.480]   You could aggregate in all of your Friends updates.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.240]   You could pull in RSS feeds.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.320]   And even I look at Tumblr today, or a couple of years ago,
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.560]   started doing that.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.840]   And all of these services have these couple of traits
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.040]   that are really common, which is the Friend page.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   The aggregation of everything your friends is doing
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.840]   is completely addictive.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.400]   It pushes towards really very short updates,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.320]   sort of long updates.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.560]   But then you have this point of responses and comments
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.600]   and replies being completely disjointed.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.840]   I remember, literally, I discovered live journal
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.920]   because somebody had syndicated my feed in there,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.880]   and there were comments replying to it.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.960]   And I was like, I don't even know what this community is.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.840]   And here's people thinking they're talking to me.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.080]   I still have that happen on Friend Feed today,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.400]   where I don't spend a lot of time in there,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.720]   and people reply to my post there.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.880]   And I have no way to even know that they're doing it.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.520]   And these conversations take on a life of their own.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.680]   I think that is a fundamentally hard challenge
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.360]   with trying to bring the outside web into a closed,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.480]   walled garden, and maybe that's why the networks
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.520]   have to open up to avoid that problem.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.400]   - I think there are ways to solve it.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.640]   Discuss and the new echo from JSKit
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.760]   are interesting.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.080]   These are commenting systems that fold the comments
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.240]   from all over the place back into the blog.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.880]   There something happened this week,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.440]   and I think, Neil, you might have been part of this.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.000]   Something happened this week.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.200]   And I think it happened 'cause of the Friend Feed sale.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.760]   Dave Winers sent me notes,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.040]   and said, "Well, really, you should go back to blogging."
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.840]   I think what happened, what people did is they abandoned
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.480]   the blog and they went to the micro blogs,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.840]   and they said, "Well, I have a presence on Facebook, Twitter,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.200]   and/or Friend Feed."
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.040]   That's where I happened to me.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.560]   That was the easiest place to put stuff,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.520]   so I stopped blogging so much.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.640]   And I think people are gonna come back to the blog, Neil?
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.160]   - Yeah, I mean, for me, it's almost a political thing.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.240]   Like I--
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.680]   - You own your stuff.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.080]   - Yeah, it's straight up about ownership.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.720]   I mean, my background before I was really even
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.360]   in the tech industry, I was in the music business,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.480]   and I saw the difference between artists
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.960]   that own their stuff and those that didn't,
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   and what they could do with their careers.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.240]   And so I like Mark Zuckerberg fine.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.640]   I'm friends with Evan Biz,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   like I admire Twitter very greatly.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.080]   But I'm not ever gonna create the most valuable things
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.920]   that I write.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   I put a lot of effort into the things I create.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.120]   I'm not gonna put them someplace at somebody else.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.160]   - I'll have a lot of people who put them on friend feeders
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.720]   having second thoughts saying, what have I done?
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.160]   We're all, this is another meme that's just sprung up.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.800]   We're all investors in these companies
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.680]   who don't get paid when the company liquidates.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   You know, I felt that with Twitter.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.080]   I felt kind of, you know, like I put my heart and soul
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.320]   into Twitter, and they abandoned me for Oprah,
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.960]   and/or Ashton or somebody.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.040]   But that's what happens to geeks, right?
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.440]   We early adopters, we move in,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.760]   and if the company that we support is successful,
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.440]   they go broad anyway.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.760]   - But with blogging, when the other people came in,
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.160]   it was still a victory for us.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.480]   My site didn't go away.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.320]   - Right.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.880]   - And he could overshadow the importance, you know,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.600]   of the people using, you know, WordPress or Typepad
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.080]   or whatever, like your importance doesn't go away
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.160]   when somebody else new comes into the medium.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.120]   - But aren't you really just another walled garden?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   I mean, aren't you?
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.840]   - I mean, on my site, I'm King, right?
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.280]   And I think, you know, I see that on Gina's site,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.440]   on Jeff's site, it's like, if they wanna do something
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.200]   creative and interesting and spend, you know,
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.760]   days and days on it and tons of time and money,
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.320]   at the end of the day, they own it
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.440]   and nobody can take that away.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   I think that's pretty important.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.000]   - But you lose all these things that Kevin Marks talks about
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.600]   in his blog post.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   He talks about flow, whether it's just this kind of flow
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.840]   of information.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   You see faces of people in that, I guess,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.360]   you know, there are ways to solve that with a friend connector,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.760]   blog, my blog, blog, or there are a lot of different ways
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.600]   to do that.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.000]   I know Six Apart has some good solutions.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.320]   He says, "Hey, this is an interesting one."
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.240]   He says, "It's phatic."
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.480]   That's the term I'd not heard before, pH, A-T-I-C,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.680]   full of social gestures that are like apes grooming each other.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.160]   But all of this stuff is, appears in places like Twitter,
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.680]   but does it appear on your blog?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.520]   Don't you lose a lot of it?
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.360]   - It should.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.240]   I think actually the great blogs do it.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   One of my favorite sites is Metafilter,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.600]   and Matt Howie's site at different times than 10 years.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.400]   And there are a million little gestures you can do there
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.160]   of like you click a little plus sign and your favorite something
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.840]   or you give something a thumbs up.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.040]   I think the sites that are really seeing that succeed,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.000]   I look for the geeky side of things, stack overflow.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.320]   My wife runs a real popular food site series.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.400]   Each of these sites, I think, has this amazing sense of like,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.000]   you can make those little gestures.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.360]   And I mean, when we have a service box,
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.680]   it's kind of like a friends and family-
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.760]   - Love box, yeah.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.600]   - Thanks.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.160]   And that was, I mean, we had this thing that Mina Trot
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.680]   was really adamant about having, this is good.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.520]   And it was just being able to click a box
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.560]   and say that something somebody did was good,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.320]   explicitly as a gesture.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.680]   And I think it has to be lowering the threshold from,
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.440]   oh, I go in to the comment form and maybe I sign in
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.240]   and I typed some text and then I hit post.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.800]   Like, that's a lot of steps.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.240]   And you want people to just be able to kind of give you
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.560]   that head nod of, hey, that was pretty nice.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.080]   And then if they want to add more to it, that's great too.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.640]   - But they're complimentary, right?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.160]   Jay Rosen uses Twitter to push an idea
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.640]   or to link to something.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   People of the New York Times use it to promote their stories.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   I think that the reporters use it to get to gather data
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.520]   in real time.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.600]   I use it today to find out something
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.400]   for a presentation I'm doing this week.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.280]   I think they're not either or.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.600]   The question is, how do you bring them together more?
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.760]   - I feel like blogs are like islands.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.640]   And they're loosely if confederated,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.560]   but they're still islands that,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.920]   are we going back to RSS?
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.080]   - I think we're upgrading RSS.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.400]   - I thought it was dead.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.320]   (laughing)
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.160]   - Please.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   - I'm telling you.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.920]   - They're whiner, I'm gonna call it.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.280]   (laughing)
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.720]   - My answer to people to say RSS is dead is always the same,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.520]   which is like, okay, then stop using it.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.240]   - Right, we're using it non-stop.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.560]   - In every possible way.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.400]   - Yeah.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.640]   - We always say it's dead when something becomes so ubiquitous.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.480]   It's invisible.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.000]   But I think we just upgrade RSS.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.400]   We give it the ability to be faster
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.280]   and be part of that immediate real time stuff
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.320]   that Jeff was talking about.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.360]   I think we put likes into it.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.600]   So like Google Reader now,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.320]   if you view your own feed in Google Reader,
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.000]   you can see who has liked posts that you've done.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.160]   I'm sure it's a matter of time so you can pull that back out.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   - Readers look at more and more,
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.360]   I hate to say it like Friend Feed.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.120]   I'm gonna talk a little bit about Reader.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120]   It's my tool of the week,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.160]   but it's looking more and more like Friend Feed with likes.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.600]   And in fact, Facebook, it was pretty obvious,
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.440]   was stealing a page from Friend Feed's a book with likes
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.280]   and commenting and that live stream
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.880]   is looking more and more like Friend Feed.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.760]   I could easily see Friend Feed just appearing
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.520]   as that middle column, that news stream, almost intact.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.480]   - Do you think that this is,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.840]   a lot of this is, this discussion is about a battle
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.680]   for who, what pages come up when someone searches
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.560]   for a person online, right?
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.680]   So you have like Facebook wants to have public pages
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.320]   for people, they have public search listings already.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.200]   I think that they're gonna enhance those
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.720]   with the Friend Feed integration
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.320]   if they do continue with Friend Feed's aggregation.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.240]   Google Profiles, which we talked about last week
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   is doing a similar thing.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.680]   But honestly, when it comes down to a blog,
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.480]   which you write and update frequently
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.640]   is the best way to get into search results
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.200]   and to get found and to put out there
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.080]   the things that you wanna put out there.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.920]   So, I don't know, sometimes I'm like,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.280]   this is just a giant people search play,
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.480]   the Friend Feed Facebook discussion or so.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.600]   - Yeah, who owns your name online?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   I think the conversation and I would delete my account
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.320]   on every service out there before I let them come up.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   I had it my own site for my name.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.920]   - So we should all blog again.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.520]   Well, you all are blogging again,
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.560]   but everybody else should stop messing around
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.640]   with the Twitter and blog or should you Twitter and blog?
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.480]   - Do both.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.800]   - Well, welcome together.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.640]   - Yeah. - Welcome together, right?
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.760]   Like get some value out of it
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.840]   so that it's driving people into your--
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.920]   - So how do you hook them together
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   so that whenever you blog, it goes to Twitter,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.480]   but then when you tweet, does it go to your blog?
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.720]   - God help me, but I'm gonna bring up Wave.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.360]   'Cause I think there's something about that
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   that says that you start to combine set units and flows.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.160]   And we try to figure that out.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.440]   Part of the problem in media is that we have been making
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.160]   people come to us, follow the light children,
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.080]   come to our sites, you've got to come to us.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.360]   - That's the problem I have with blogging.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.880]   - You're right there, Leo.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.000]   And so what we need is some new architecture
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.760]   that hasn't been invented yet,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.960]   that is some combination of a distributed flow and assets.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.240]   If a blog post is an asset,
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.040]   how does that fit in with the flow of Twitter,
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.840]   with the ability to comment on it,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.520]   with the ability of people to distribute it?
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.320]   I don't think we've seen anything close to this yet.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.280]   - And we've really separated the act of reading and writing.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.120]   We've put the part that has to do with interacting
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.480]   with your audience 100 miles away from the part
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.640]   that has to do with creating content.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.360]   And we need to bring those things in tighter circle.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.320]   I think the problem is right now,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.800]   everybody that's brought real-time elements into blogging
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.720]   has done it by saying, well, here's the latest noise
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.240]   about that tag that you're talking about.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   - Yes.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.560]   - As opposed to what real-time can do at its best,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   which is here's a shared experience we're having.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.800]   I was playing with Chart Beat, which is a-
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.640]   - Love Chart Beat.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.480]   - A stats app.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.320]   It's a very cool-
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.160]   - Oh, man.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.640]   - I'm partial 'cause they're based here in New York,
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.840]   which means that they're awesome.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.960]   And I got that sense of, you know, I wrote a post
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.400]   and it was very lucky a couple people shared it on Twitter.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.640]   And it said, oh, 200 people are on your site
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.080]   reading this right now.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.640]   And I thought, one, I've been blogging 10 years,
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.280]   I've never known that.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.800]   I've never known there's this many people
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.440]   looking at something all at once.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   And two, they have no way of telling that either.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.920]   You can't tell it's a crowded room.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.120]   And to their credit, friend feed room,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   you know when there's a lot of people there.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   - Right.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.720]   - And I think that's a totally-
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.040]   - Well, how do we do that?
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.120]   - I mean, you guys must be looking at that at six apart.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.440]   How do we do that?
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.960]   It's just technology.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.000]   Do you have a little dashboard?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.720]   I know when we, on our video feeds,
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.440]   we used to have how many people are watching.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.360]   And people miss that.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.320]   They love that feeling that there was a lot of people
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.280]   there with you at the same time.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.200]   - And it makes you feel good about
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.880]   what you're reading or watching too.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.240]   - Right, like I must have good taste
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.280]   'cause there's a hundred other people here with me.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.480]   This is the show to be at.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.920]   Like you look at the crowd. - Social beast.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   We like crabs. - We like crabs.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.320]   - Yeah, we like swarms.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.560]   We wanna be part of that.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.280]   So you think it's just technology.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.640]   You think you could solve that just by a dashboard
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   or something on that?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.760]   - No, I mean, I think technology is a tiny part of it.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.560]   I think it's mostly social.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.840]   I think it's all about thinking through
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   what are the things that make us have that great feeling.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.160]   Like I went and saw a concert the other night
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.600]   and it was three in the morning
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.680]   and everybody was hopping up and down, totally awake.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.200]   And it was because it was a great show.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.920]   And it was one of those like,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   oh, they're here for this moment
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.760]   as much as they're here for the band.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   And technology, we would literally be looking at that room
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.240]   and be like, well, what guitar are they playing?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.480]   What drum kit is he using?
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.200]   And it's like, that's actually not the most important part.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.440]   - It's still fun.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.720]   - Yeah, it was super fun.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.960]   But we need to not look at the nuts and bolts of it
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   so much as like what are the behaviors, I think.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.280]   So Billy gave me a chart beat account for the page
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.000]   that most of you are watching right now,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.640]   the live.twit.tv page.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.960]   And it's really, it's interesting.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.040]   I would love to surface it.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.840]   I don't know how you surface it.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.800]   - There's a Share link on chart beat
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.320]   that you can have this little copy link up
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.360]   at the top of the page, at least online, I have not.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.920]   So share your dashboard history, I think.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.240]   - Okay, and that goes, I could put that.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.720]   Maybe, yeah, okay, maybe I could put that
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.440]   at the bottom of the page or something.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.360]   Interesting. - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.240]   - Yeah, you could see all over the world
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.400]   where people are watching and there's people in Australia
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.080]   and Asia and there's some one person from Russia.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.080]   Hello Russia.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.280]   That is a kind of a neat thing to be able to share with people.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.320]   I just, the problem I have with the blog
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.840]   is it just seems so, I don't know,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.520]   maybe it's just too personal, so personal.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's like, this is me.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.520]   And if I want to see a kneel, I have to go to a kneel.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.640]   - How do we advocate? - We don't have a way
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.240]   to seamlessly go back and forth yet.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.440]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.400]   So there's a challenge left for the listener.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.640]   Solve that problem and you'll be a rich, rich person.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.480]   - Yeah.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.800]   - Google launched caffeine this week.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.320]   Do you know what's caffeine?
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.520]   I can't figure it out, it looks exactly like Google to me.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.200]   - Yeah, to the end user, it looks pretty much the same.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.280]   In fact, when you bookmark this story, I thought,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.480]   wow, I don't really see the differences.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.320]   - Right.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.400]   - But can you guys hear me okay?
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.200]   I feel like I'm going in and out.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.040]   - I blocked out for a second.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.720]   Okay, but what it is, I just saw that interview
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.560]   with Matt Cutz, I mean, the search,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.840]   had the webspan team at Google.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.760]   It's a total rewrite of Google's,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.400]   not a total rewrite, but a major rewrite of Google's index.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.760]   Indexing engine, I believe.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.120]   - It's really fast.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.360]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.960]   - So pops up like instantly.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.600]   Google generally does though.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.920]   You know, I tried a bunch of searches
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.680]   and I really didn't see that big a difference.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.280]   But it sounds like, you know, Matt said
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.680]   that it was a pretty big update,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.000]   as big as an update as they,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.360]   I guess they had another update in like 2005,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.080]   which was quite a time ago.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.160]   - Yeah.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.800]   - So yeah, but I don't see much of a difference.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.560]   - Functionality, it's the same, I guess.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.840]   - Functionality is the same, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.560]   It's pretty cool that they're putting the sandbox out there
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.680]   and letting a site owners who are particularly concerned
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   with their rank give it a try and send feedback.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.480]   That's pretty cool.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.560]   I think that's the first time they've ever done that
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.680]   as far as I know.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.640]   Nice move toward sort of being a little more open
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.320]   and beta testing search results,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.640]   which I think they've done before,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.880]   though they've beta other stuff.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.960]   - Yeah, so the, so you,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.240]   what would you do as a site owner?
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.600]   You'd look in and say,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   so the results change, are they different?
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.680]   Then the other, then the other Google,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.120]   the original Google classic?
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.600]   - If you compare them side by side,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.120]   which I did for several searches,
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.440]   yeah, you can check to see, you know,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   what results are different.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.120]   For me, the searches that I tried,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:41.960]   it wasn't very different.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.920]   Yeah, I mean, I did several searches for topics
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.600]   that I know are hot on Life Hacker
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.480]   and some other projects that I worked on
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.720]   and they look pretty much the same.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.080]   I don't know, have any of you guys seen
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.600]   any significant differences?
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.800]   - No, but you're gonna see it in more big statistics.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.440]   I, you know, when Google burps,
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.320]   everybody else gets ulcers.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.160]   And I used to consult for about.com,
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   which gets 80% of its traffic from Google
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.960]   and half its ad revenue from Google.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.520]   And whatever Google would so much as,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.080]   as change a dial a little bit,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.480]   the impact on the business was big, potentially.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.320]   - Right.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   - And they monitored every possible metric they could.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.600]   And I think this has a huge impact in the long run
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.280]   on companies that have a lot of search.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.680]   If you lose 3% of your value in a given Google juice area,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.200]   that has a big impact on you.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.800]   And it's hard to see that in individual searches.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.320]   - Yeah, it might be certain terms too
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.120]   that are really the making difference
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.000]   for certain companies.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.560]   And they just are terms that might not register for us,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.320]   you know, things that we don't look up.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.440]   My experience in testing a couple terms was basically,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.400]   it was harder to tell a difference
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.760]   between the two versions of Google
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.640]   than it was between Google and say Bing.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.560]   And even those two were barely distinguishable.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.680]   - Right.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.400]   Yeah, I mean, six apart probably has a lot of interest
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.000]   in this since, you know, how well Google searches your,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.360]   your hosted blogs is probably a pretty big deal
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.640]   to your customers.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.800]   - It matters, yeah, I mean, it matters a lot for that.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Honestly, the thing that is getting a lot more attention
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.680]   from our customers is, and I think bloggers in general,
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.640]   is how quick we're getting to search engines
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.800]   as opposed to ranking.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.960]   Like they know the SEO, I mean, the tips
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.200]   haven't changed in five years.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.840]   Update a lot, put a good title in, you know,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   we do all the URLs, stuff is all automatic these days
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   on any blogging tool.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   But we've had this thing for a couple of years
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.600]   that today we'd call a fire host, like what Twitter has
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.920]   of, you know, all the updates.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.480]   And the type type services that we do is how to have firehose.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.080]   And it's funny, it's been running for years,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.680]   and it's been the last six months where all of a sudden
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   it's really interesting to people of how quickly
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.440]   am I going to get into Google, as opposed to
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.840]   where do I rank in the search terms?
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.480]   'Cause they're like, I know I'm gonna rank,
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.120]   but I wanna be the newest result, not the first result.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.960]   - That's that real-time web again, isn't it?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.720]   - Yeah, and that's a, I mean, that is a radical change.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.520]   I think that's as big a change as like before
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.520]   PageRank and after.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.160]   I think, you know, there's no name for like,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   PageRank for newness, as opposed to PageRank for authority.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.520]   But, you know, again, and we've all been blogging
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.120]   for eight, 10 years, that thing that was new about blogs,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.560]   as the newest post was at the top.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.760]   And now we're finally gonna think about like search engines
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.520]   where that's true, like the only search engine
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.200]   where that's true right now is Twitter and Friend feed.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.640]   - Is this related to the push button web
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.080]   that you were talking about?
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.280]   - Yeah, I mean, it was one of the things that informed,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.080]   I wrote a post a couple weeks ago,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   a couple of push button web,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.560]   just saying there's a lot of really interesting
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.040]   real-time tech out there.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   I was thinking more about, for developers,
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.320]   how do you get a message out there?
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.280]   But certainly one element of it is search,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   it is going to be as important to have search engine delivery
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.300]   as search engine optimization.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:02.680]   - Leo, in London, the telegraph led the way
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   on the story of MP expense scandals.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.280]   And they got some crap for not going web first,
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.560]   but the director of digital there explained to me
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.120]   that they wanted to be on top of Google News
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.320]   at a re-opportunity, so they scheduled the release
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.640]   of the stories just beyond Google News.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.800]   - So the news cycle begins with Google these days,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.000]   not CNN or NBC, how interesting.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.440]   Wow. - But I think we've all even
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280]   known that, right?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.600]   - So you put out a blog post on a Thursday morning
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.680]   'cause you know it's a big day for traffic engine.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.320]   You live and die in that world for a long time.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.720]   - Oh yes. - You come with us.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.560]   - Is that true?
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.440]   So Thursday morning, that's the time.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.840]   - Yeah, yeah, well for us, we would analyze
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.600]   our daily traffic, like what time of the day.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.800]   So we publish our features, or Life Hacker publishes
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.360]   its features at 9 a.m. for example,
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.440]   which is 9 a.m. on the West Coast and then noon
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   on the East Coast, so people are just arriving to work
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.120]   or going to lunch and then that kind of thing.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   Normally I would go for like a Tuesday,
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.240]   if I had a story that I thought could really get legs
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.440]   and it wasn't time dependent,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.560]   I would go for a Tuesday or a Wednesday.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.240]   But yeah, certainly think about that stuff a lot.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.640]   - My wife, I mean it was Dane laughed at me
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.160]   'cause I was gonna do a Twitter post that
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.440]   I wanted everybody to see and I said,
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.520]   well I have to wait 'til five o'clock East Coast.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.400]   And he kind of laughed at me and he said,
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.960]   you pay attention to when you're tweet?
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.120]   I said, of course, don't you?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.240]   You're tweeting the middle of the night,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.760]   it's gonna be Australia that sees it.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.400]   You have to know where your audience is.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.880]   - And I think we've all internalized that
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.640]   without even realizing it. - Maybe so.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   - I mean I've been trying to do big blog posts every week
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.800]   and I started, I did the first one or two on Wednesday,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.560]   Thursday and then I just started doing them Fridays
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.080]   'cause it was easier to get done for the end of the week.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   But it was great because Fridays aren't crowded.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.240]   - Oh yeah, there's not as much stuff.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.880]   - Yeah and I tended to write the thing where I'm like,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.760]   well I wanna get the people that are actually gonna spend
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.480]   a little bit of time on the weekend looking at this stuff
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.680]   who are a little, they're probably a little more hardcore
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.040]   geeks than the people that just do it nine to five
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   on a Friday.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.520]   And so they get this slow build and you also have that
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.040]   sense of nobody wants to share anything on Twitter
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.000]   or on Friend Feed if they feel like everybody's
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.800]   already seen it, they wanna be the person
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.000]   sharing that thing first.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.960]   - The first one.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.520]   - Right and that's a lot easier to happen when there's
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.000]   lower noise, lower volume and there's not this
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.600]   such a buzzy environment over the weekend.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.280]   And I think this stuff is all directly related to
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.600]   like what Google must be doing with updating their index
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.160]   is thinking about like these behaviors of what, you know
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.880]   how sharing and amplification changes what we're writing.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.080]   - You hit a couple of home runs, more than a couple
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.840]   and you'll lately with your blog, we talked about
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.600]   the push button web two weeks ago.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.360]   Last week we talked about the web wave versus the wave way.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.600]   I know you heard that conversation.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.920]   Is there anything you wanted to add to that?
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.000]   - Yeah, I mean you all covered, it's one of the situations
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   where I did a little bit of work on the writing
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.560]   and then you guys took it into this whole other level.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.960]   So it was, I mean it's really exciting.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.680]   It was like, wow, there's more there than I thought.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.560]   I fear people thought I was being very negative about wave
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.680]   and wave is exciting.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.880]   Like I'm not anti-wave.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.240]   I just think it's super complicated.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.600]   Like as a user, you look at it, you know, like
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   I kind of don't get it.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.640]   And I think what Jeff said about this is important enough
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.760]   that we should all be thinking about that as a new wave
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.560]   interacting is absolutely right.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.640]   But the actual experience of clicking around it,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.480]   I felt like was like, I mean, I'm slow.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.760]   I mean, I didn't get friend feed either.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.840]   So I'm, I guess I'm no longer an early adopter,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.720]   but like I was like, this is tough.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.320]   This is tough and I don't see how this happens.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.280]   I think it's a lot more likely.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   We're gonna see little bits and pieces of this.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.720]   And in the same way that Facebook's not gonna do over
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.760]   the whole site to look like friend feed in a day.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.600]   - Right.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   - They're gonna put little bits and pieces out there.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.200]   - It's funny 'cause Facebook isn't easier to use
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.040]   than anything else.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.120]   I don't think.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.960]   - No.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.480]   - Maybe it's because Facebook gives you little payoffs
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.560]   along the way, you know?
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.280]   You set up a page and then your first girlfriend says,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.680]   you wanna be my friend.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.920]   And so, okay.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.320]   And so there's little hits of payoff along the way,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.760]   little crumbs for you to follow that drag you through it.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.720]   There must be some way of design.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.220]   - Like this.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.200]   - Say again?
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   - Life knows this, I hope about your first girlfriend.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.840]   (laughing)
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.400]   - I'm having lunch with my first girlfriend next week.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.240]   I haven't seen her for 36 years.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.440]   - Was it because of Facebook?
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.960]   - And then my fourth grade girlfriend said, you know.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.040]   - A fourth grade, Leo.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.800]   - I thought, wow.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.040]   - Well, okay, you know, fourth grade, she said,
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.760]   you remember when I used to kick you in the shins
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.560]   and I said, oh yeah, that was true, love.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.200]   (laughing)
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   In fourth grade, it's just a little more obvious, you know?
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.840]   - For nine years old, that's pretty good.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.360]   (laughing)
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.200]   - But, you know, Facebook has trans, I mean,
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.400]   kind of, once I jokingly called, you know,
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.840]   Facebook, classmates.com on steroids.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.960]   But it's gone beyond that.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   You have to grow beyond that, or you're not gonna--
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.800]   - That's Google too.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.360]   And I argue that young people today
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.040]   won't have the experience that you and I have
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.880]   because they will never lose touch with people.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.320]   I too lost touch with my high school girlfriend
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.880]   and thanks to Google, she found me
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.360]   and I got to apologize for being a cab at age 17.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.320]   And for that matter, to find out whatever happened to her
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.240]   and she's fascinating.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   Never would have happened.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.080]   - Yeah.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.720]   - You would have gone to our graves, never knowing.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.680]   And so I think that the impact on friendship
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.640]   and relationships for young people
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.600]   is profound in ways that we can't imagine.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.120]   And it's not just Facebook, it's just the ability
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.040]   for people to have Google shadows and to find them again.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.720]   - Well, this brings us full circle to our conversation
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.400]   about who owns your name on the web
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.000]   and how you can control that.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.040]   Because, I mean, Facebook's making a play for that.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.200]   It certainly did with the vanity URLs.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   But you still can't Google, Leo, LaPorte
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.440]   and find my Facebook page.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.000]   I don't think you can.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.240]   - If you have the vanity URL and you make it public, you can.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.320]   But I mean, I think that's an interesting question
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.000]   because why do we assume that an old girlfriend
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.120]   or an old boyfriend is looking for us on Facebook
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.240]   but not on Google?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.560]   Like why is that behavior so normal on Facebook
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.440]   and but creepy and stockish if you do it on Google?
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.520]   - No.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.360]   - No, I agree.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.200]   - There is the difference.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.360]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.040]   (laughing)
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   - Well, you guys disagree.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.920]   Now I'm curious to hear which one of you is, right?
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.760]   - I don't think so.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.120]   I think it's just another way to find people
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.000]   to find old friends and we'll have many ways in the future.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.400]   - I'll tell you the difference.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.840]   And this is exactly the problem Facebook faces
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.000]   is that Facebook is all permissions based.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.520]   Google's not.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.680]   - Well, that's the problem and it's also great asset
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.600]   is you have control.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.840]   - It is.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.800]   - And your public.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.360]   If you go back to Kevin Marks,
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.840]   it's your public and how you define your public.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.720]   - And yet, I think Facebook realizes
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   that that's essentially a walled garden
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.880]   and they don't wanna go the way of AOL and Yahoo
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.720]   or whatever.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.960]   They don't wanna be a content company
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.520]   and so they need to somehow create a public face.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.640]   I think that's their great challenge.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.960]   Google's great challenge is it's all public face.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   You don't control it in any way.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.320]   They don't have a social.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.800]   There's no social graph to Google.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.280]   Can Google is wave their attempt to add a social graph?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.040]   Can Google, does Google need a social graph?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.560]   - Or gene-apocalyptic link to reader
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   and the social aspects there now, right?
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.160]   - Yeah, we have to talk about that
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.200]   'cause that's a huge shift.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.880]   I don't think most reader people will notice it immediately.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.560]   What happened there?
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.480]   - Yeah, so Google Reader's been adding features.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.720]   They've had some social features for a while now,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   which I have to tell you, I hadn't used for a while
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.680]   because I spent four years waking up really early
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.400]   when I lived in California to write Life Hacker
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   and I would just go through hundreds and hundreds
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.440]   of feeds per day and it was a very solitary experience for me.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.120]   But now that I'm living a little bit more of a slacker life,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.520]   I let my friends find stuff.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.240]   So I've started following friends in Google Reader,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.560]   which you can do now.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.200]   And it's really great.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.240]   I mean, it's really, really great.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.280]   And Neil is much more likely to find a link
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.560]   that I'm interested in than if I go by hand
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.680]   through all my feeds.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.400]   So this week they added some more social features
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.680]   and you'll see it in the left-hand sidebar.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.800]   I think it's like one module down.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.760]   Basically, people in your Gmail contacts and your contacts list
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.240]   can follow your shared items and what items you liked
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.680]   and you can share items with notes.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   So it's pretty cool.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.600]   They are trying to create a social graph here.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.280]   I didn't really pay attention to it at first
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.040]   because honestly, I don't think Google is very good
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.320]   at social stuff at all.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.520]   They've never really been good at it.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.760]   And even this is still kind of awkward.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.000]   - It doesn't feel right, does it?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.040]   - It doesn't feel right.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.800]   It's not fully baked yet.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.280]   Part of the issue is that people follow you.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.640]   And so the list that you're showing right now on the screen,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.320]   people follow you and on one page,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.440]   you see people are following you
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.720]   and then people who want you to follow them back.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.360]   And you can ignore in one list, but you can't in another.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.120]   I mean, it's still a little not fully baked.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.480]   - When we talk about hard to grok,
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.320]   I don't understand at all what the--
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.720]   - Yeah, what's going on there.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.960]   - And I've been spending a long time looking at it.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.120]   It is wonky.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.280]   - It's funny because we say, like, oh, they're bad at social.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.240]   But my experience of going into Reader was,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.880]   I already had a buddy list.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.600]   It was already populated with a lot of people
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.280]   that I knew that were smart.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.040]   There was a lot of good content.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.840]   Like, you could do a lot worse
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.880]   than to have that as the starting point,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.720]   like fixing your why.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.640]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.480]   That's true.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.440]   But it's your Gmail contacts.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.040]   So like, I don't have contacts in Reader,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.200]   but I have them in Gmail.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.960]   So it connects them.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.800]   So that's a little weird.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.520]   You're like, oh, and like, people are following me
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.040]   and I'm not quite sure how they found me.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.600]   I don't even know who these people are.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   - Yeah, like they're people that you don't really know
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.160]   and you're like, how do they know?
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.000]   I mean, I--
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.080]   - You know what's missing?
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.920]   There's social without the graph.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.200]   It's like, there's no connection to my life here.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.040]   These are--
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.840]   - I had the opposite experience, which was that my wife was like,
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.160]   oh, Gina shared your post.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.480]   She must have liked it.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   And I was like, really?
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.560]   'Cause I didn't know.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.400]   - Right.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.960]   - And you know, we email were connected.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.200]   We were on the chat together.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.560]   Like, I don't know what some missing part,
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.600]   like, and I still don't know.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.720]   Literally some part that was missing said,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.480]   you're not connected and you can't know this.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.400]   And so I had to manually go and find it out.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.040]   And I think, so like, those are solvable problems,
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.120]   but like the core thing of, are there millions of people here
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.160]   that have already made a list in GChat or GTalk or Gmail
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.680]   or whatever G other products there are?
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.160]   Like, that those things all exist.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.760]   I did, you know, briefly have a network on ORCAD
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.240]   sometime many years ago.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.320]   - Oh yeah, I remember them, yeah.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.760]   - And I have family in India, so I actually,
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.720]   like, they're actually active there.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.640]   And yet none of that is tied into it.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.280]   And I think part of the reason is the reader team
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.640]   is scared of it because they did share a couple years ago.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.960]   They had the sharing link and reader.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.360]   And they made it that, like, you clicked share
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.200]   and it would share with everybody that you'd ever emailed
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   on Gmail or something.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.200]   And people freaked out, right?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.800]   It was like, oh, you can't scare people's behavior.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   And now as a result, they've been so afraid to do that.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.120]   They've had to add additional behaviors.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.720]   So I can go to an individual post that I like
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.680]   and I can star it, I can share it,
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.240]   I can share it with a node and I can like it.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.280]   - It's gotten, it's really too complicated.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.320]   - And then, in addition, there's a way to, like,
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.160]   comment as well.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.840]   Like, so there's like four different,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.560]   four or five different things you can do.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.760]   And I swear to you, I have no idea what they do
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.600]   that are different.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.800]   If I like something, I click all of them.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.360]   I make them all light up.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.520]   - That's 'cause like share, share with an idea now.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.360]   - Just do it all. - Because it's bigger.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.120]   - Just do it all. - This way I've indicated, yeah.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.680]   I'm really on board with this thing.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.520]   But they might as well make them all one switch
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.320]   'cause I have no idea what they do.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.880]   - And this week they added send to this week as well.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.200]   They integrated other services.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.000]   So you can send items to, in fact,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.320]   that's the real thing that was like,
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.760]   that was the new this week, the send to.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.640]   And what's cool about that too, is that they made it open.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.480]   So you can create custom URL.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.240]   So you can say make this a PDF, for example,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.640]   and use a service that turns into PDF.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.480]   So that was really neat.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.200]   - That's the first thing I did is I added the Save as PDF.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.960]   That was a post, I can remember the blog,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.360]   but it was a really great little tip.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.720]   And then they've added, you know,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.000]   they didn't have friend feed at first.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.080]   They've added posters, they've added friend feed,
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.320]   they've added a few extra sites.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.760]   - Tumblers there, which is great.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.000]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.720]   The feature that I really like that launched this week
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.920]   is in social at all.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.160]   It gives you the option to mark all items as red
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.440]   that are older after a certain day.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.720]   - A little lose, yeah.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.920]   - Yeah, this is the feature that I loved
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.640]   in my desktop reader now that I finally have in Google Reader.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.040]   So you can say, you know, I've got a news folder
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.400]   that some days I just don't have a chance to look at it.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.720]   And I love the idea of being able to say,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.880]   "Mark, everything in this folder that's older than a day."
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.240]   Because basically news it's older than a day
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.320]   I'm not gonna look at.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.160]   So I think it's a day, week, and two weeks.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.240]   So that's awesome, really love it.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.920]   - So you know what, I love the feature too,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.360]   and I'll disagree, I think it is a social feature.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.200]   I think liberating people from obligation and stress
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.880]   is absolutely necessary as a social feature.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   And I think that's the part with Twitter
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.480]   of like, you missed the first page of tweets,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.400]   oh well, they're gone, it's okay.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.440]   Same thing with Facebook.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.280]   And I think I didn't get it like 10 years ago
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.840]   when Dave Winner was talking about River of News.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.840]   And I got it much, much later of like being able to have
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.360]   what Kevin Marks was calling a flow
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.600]   that it's okay if you miss some of the flow,
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.880]   it's essential to social behavior.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.200]   If you show up late to a party,
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.000]   you're not like, what was every conversation I missed
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.160]   before I got to this party.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.000]   - Right, you don't come to it.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   - In order for me to have context.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.960]   You show up, you go, you leave, you gotta run.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.800]   - Right.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.280]   - There's something else going on, no problem.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.040]   And so I actually think Mark that all stuff is read
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   is absolutely essential for social features at work.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   - Well, this is gonna sound funny,
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.960]   but as people reacted to my announcement of my disease,
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.400]   I found myself letting the Twitter and the friend,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.640]   the Twitter stuff kind of flowed over me, right?
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.320]   I didn't have to respond, I was grateful, email,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.840]   I suddenly felt an obligation to respond.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.680]   I don't know why.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.440]   The social conventions of these various media, Facebook,
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.120]   if it was a direct message I responded,
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.600]   if it was wall I didn't, and on and on,
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.640]   I found myself with these built in presumptions
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.760]   about my obligation to respond,
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.920]   and that's a funny social angle for it.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.280]   - Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.040]   You know, it's interesting what Kevin Marks did,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.120]   an interesting thing that,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.600]   it makes sense that Kevin would understand
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.520]   how this works better than anybody else.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.440]   I don't even know how he did this.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.720]   He shared his article that you were talking about,
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.640]   and Neil, how Twitter works in theory,
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.600]   and then he put a little,
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.200]   I don't even know how he did this,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.560]   a little quote mark that says,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   "I guess that's the note part."
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.960]   Question for those reading my shared items
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.440]   is sharing my own post like this helpful or redundant.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.560]   So there is a social aspect.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   I mean, I don't think he's gonna get much engagement
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.360]   because of just kind of the difficulty responding to that.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.560]   - And here's the bug too, is that,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.640]   the only reason he's probably even able to share
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.600]   his own post in the RSS readers,
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.960]   'cause there's no way for Google to know he wrote that.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.200]   - That's a flaw. - It's just another feed.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.480]   And that's the thing we have to be able to solve,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.400]   'cause then you can actually do some interesting stuff
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.120]   where you can say, "I'm the owner of this."
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.760]   - They do know though,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.440]   they do know through Google profiles.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.320]   In fact, this is another feature that launched this week,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.760]   is that you can say, "Show me all the people
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   "in my contacts list and the feeds that they own."
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.200]   And the feeds that you own, quote unquote,
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.800]   are the ones that you list in your Google profile.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.680]   So like a Neil, like I was looking at yours
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   and you've got a buttload of links on your Google profile,
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.800]   which is, yeah, that's a metric.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.640]   - Where do I do that?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.720]   Where do I find that?
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.240]   - So, what is this? - That's the other problem,
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.480]   is where the hell is it?
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.640]   - Where does this work? - Yeah, I mean,
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.560]   there's no coherence to the whole Google thing.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.640]   And I think this is one of the things
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.480]   they have to reckon with.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.560]   I thought about this, even if I just wanna create content
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.160]   with them, I don't know if it's talk or chat or whatever.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.320]   - Well, chat's tied into this too.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.360]   - Yeah, somehow.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.120]   - 'Cause I see people that are on my chat list,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.520]   I somehow are automatically shared or something.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.720]   - So, go to a, wait, it's yet another one.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.800]   - Right.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.560]   - Click on browse for stuff in Google readers' left-hand column.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.400]   - Okay, browse for stuff. - And then up on the top
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.240]   of the right-hand- - Which by the way,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.520]   what does that even mean?
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.000]   Browse for stuff. - Browse for stuff.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.280]   - I've got all my feeds here.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   Browse what for what stuff?
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   Imagine the meeting where that came out.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.120]   (laughs)
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.240]   - Oh, you know, we gotta add a high-level menu item
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.640]   that says, "Undernotes, trends your stuff."
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.840]   Browse for stuff.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.160]   - Huh? - That's for stuff.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.320]   And then click on from people you follow.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.280]   - Yeah. - Okay, so this is stuff
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.720]   for people I follow.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.080]   - So there, you see a list of people.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.280]   - And all their stuff.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.920]   - All their stuff, which they've claimed on Google profiles.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.720]   See, this is the thing, all these links happen
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.840]   between disparate products and you're like,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.440]   "Oh, these are my Gmail contacts.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.240]   Oh, these are links from Google profiles."
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.680]   But it doesn't even say that.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.840]   This also launched this week, which is interesting.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.200]   - Well, I don't even mean anything.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.280]   Like I could claim smarter wear, right?
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.120]   - You could.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.280]   There's a way to verify, and actually Leo did this.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.120]   I haven't done this.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.760]   There's a way to claim a site or feed.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.360]   Leo, you verified your URL.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.560]   - Yeah. - So it's on the file.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.280]   - Well, wait a minute.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.040]   You've, okay, there's two things you can verify,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:15.880]   your name.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   We talked about that last week.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.880]   And Google allows you, in your Google account,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.920]   to add verified emails.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.480]   - Oh, emails? - And once you've done that,
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.040]   then it knows these domains.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.360]   So it's verified domains.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.720]   It don't show the email, but it shows on my profile,
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.880]   leoville.com, twit.tv, and techguilabs.com,
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.640]   are verified domains of mine.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.480]   - Well, and then there's the thing,
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.360]   Google Webmaster Tools lets you verify that you own a site.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.520]   And Google Apps for your domain lets you verify
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.360]   that you own a site.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.240]   Those are two completely different mechanisms,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.880]   and those are completely untied to this.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.400]   I mean, there's, there's, there's just from Google,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   there's half a dozen ways to say I own this feed.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.360]   And even if I've done all of them, which I have,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.480]   it still doesn't know that in reader.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   But isn't this right?
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.760]   - Yeah, whether it's Facebook or Google or someone,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   the ownership of your identity is gonna be the key hub
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.360]   to all of this idea of getting past Leo's problem
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.400]   with the blog and having to go there,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.880]   and having to say, who the hell is Gina?
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.720]   What does she have?
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   Where is she?
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.480]   Is it really her?
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.320]   That's gonna be vital, and no one's won that yet,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.920]   but it's a huge win if you can get it.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.720]   - And the most ridiculous thing is owning a URL
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.880]   and proving you own it is one of the only problems
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.240]   that is solved, like OpenID, you can actually say,
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.440]   I verify I control this URL.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.200]   - But can't you say it of others URLs?
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.040]   Who's verifying that you do in fact own that URL?
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.600]   - With OpenID, you can't, it'll actually--
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.000]   - You have to put some JavaScript on it.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:43.840]   - Yeah, yeah, it is.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   - But that's only your OpenID canonical URL.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.080]   I guess you could put it on all your sites.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.920]   - Yeah, but you can actually,
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.360]   there's a thing called delegation where I can say,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.800]   so I don't run an OpenID server,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.880]   but I can say I own dashes.com,
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.800]   I'm pointing it at whatever problem I did.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.880]   - I do that with my sites.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.800]   So then now that's becomes my site
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.000]   because I've put that JavaScript on there.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.920]   - Yeah, or that little line in the HTML, whatever it is.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.760]   But the point is that--
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.160]   - It's the point of that same Twitter
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.560]   and with Facebook and with some--
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.280]   - You can't 'cause you don't own those servers.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.120]   - That's the problem.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.440]   - You could even, to some degree with Twitter
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.640]   by saying I'm gonna use the authentication,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.000]   the OAuth system that they have.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   Facebook maybe could do it through Facebook Connect.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.080]   I mean, the problem is you're talking
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.520]   about three or four different systems,
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.360]   but it's three or four.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.880]   It's not a hundred.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.160]   And that's the funny thing is that
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.240]   even though we have this ability to say,
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.560]   if nothing else, I control this one URL
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.160]   where this feed lives.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.960]   Even that ability isn't being used.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.800]   And instead we're here, here we are manually typing in,
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   I own this web domain and I can still go into reader
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.600]   and say I run smarter where or I run twit.tv
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.880]   and they can't stop me from saying that right now.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.360]   - Right.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.400]   - Right, right, that's true.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.880]   This is a huge changes reader change though.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.280]   It's quite a huge change.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.800]   - It does, it's quietly huge.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.880]   Nobody knows about it.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.880]   (laughs)
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.200]   Well, we're telling them about it.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.280]   It's funny because I was moving a little bit away
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.760]   from two things, blogs and RSS readers
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.080]   because Twitter and the real time, blah, blah, blah,
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.760]   and this week, two things, they keep pulling me back.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.880]   Two things have pulled me back to the blog
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.960]   and two RSS aggregates.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.840]   What do each of you use as your primary RSS reader?
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.960]   - Gina?
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.320]   - Google Reader.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   - Danielle?
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.760]   - Google Reader.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.680]   And the cool thing about it is it's semi real time now
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.040]   with the Pub/Sub/Hub/Bub stuff they did.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.600]   Any feed bar and feed that updates shows up in real time
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.720]   and reader it blinks for me
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.840]   and I think that's gonna be there for everybody soon.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.200]   That's crazy.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.040]   - Pretty cool.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.440]   - That's as compelling as what friend feed or Twitter.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.360]   - Really cool.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.200]   - That's gonna be huge.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.480]   I use Google Reader also.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.000]   How about you, Jeff?
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.200]   - I'm still on Net Newswire, old part.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.280]   - I use Net Newswire too
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.200]   'cause it syncs with Google Reader.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.840]   - Yeah, now it does.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.440]   - So you still, you know,
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.920]   it's hard me to adjust.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.840]   - I like Google Reader.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.760]   I'm using both Net Newswire and Google Reader,
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.600]   but that's good because I can now.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.480]   - The one feature that Google Reader doesn't have yet,
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.120]   and actually this is gonna be in our wish list section,
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.040]   but I'll say it now.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   I mean, they're adding all these social features
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.160]   which are cool,
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.720]   but you still can't subscribe to a password feed
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.760]   in Google Reader.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.360]   It doesn't handle private feeds,
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.280]   which isn't that big a deal to most people,
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.560]   but it is kind of a big deal for web applications
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.240]   you have to log into to get data.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.360]   And I just don't understand.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.560]   I mean, that's the one reason that you use--
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.640]   - That's a weird thing not to have.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.840]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's why you use
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.800]   a desktop news reader, right?
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.520]   One, hit the refresh button, we talked about this.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.440]   Hit the refresh button, you know you're getting the latest,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.280]   right?
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.000]   Google's gonna solve that with the, or hopefully,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.520]   but Google Reader's gonna have that with the real time updates.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.040]   But then the second one is private feeds
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.080]   from your web-based project management app, for example,
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:56.920]   that kind of thing.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.000]   So I'm interested to see them build that in.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.760]   I would imagine they would have built that in
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.640]   before this stuff, but--
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.840]   - That one feels like a tech problem, right?
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.320]   There's a million things that can go wrong
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.760]   with passwords, you're storing passwords for people's feeds,
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.800]   people can share items in their public page
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.960]   that were formerly private.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.160]   It opens up a can of worms, and it's much easier
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.720]   to just say no, we can't.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.320]   - Right, right, right, right.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.520]   - Than to really solve it, I think.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.360]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.640]   - Oh man, we have to wrap it up 'cause Jeff's got pizza,
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.160]   but I just wanna keep talking about this.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.240]   I guess we'll just have to do another episode.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.160]   And another, and another, and another.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.320]   Anil, I wanna thank you so much for joining us.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.720]   You can stick around for, we do a little thing,
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.160]   if you want, and throw in some comments,
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.240]   we do a little thing at the end,
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.320]   and the last thing we do is our wish list.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.520]   So if you have a feature, a Google feature,
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.080]   or something that you'd like Google to fix,
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.160]   you can think about that right now.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.480]   But we're gonna start with Gina's tip of the week,
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.240]   which I think you might have already done, but go ahead.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.080]   - Oh yes, actually, no, I didn't.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.960]   Tip of the week, this week, really super simple one,
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:04.480]   to get friendly with your J and K keys on your keyboard,
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.960]   because those move you up and down items in Gmail,
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.040]   Google Reader, and in Google search results,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.520]   if you're in the keyboard extension, right?
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.880]   - And in search results.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.120]   - Yeah, there's an experimental Google search
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.360]   that you can join, and in fact, the link is on my blog.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.160]   The link to this entire tip is on my blog.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.680]   You can join an experiment where if you do a Google search,
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.560]   a little pointer will be next to the top result,
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.480]   and you can use the J key, the K key,
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.040]   to move up and down the list.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   And then you can hit enter to open up one of those links,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.320]   or shift enter to open it in new tab.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.040]   So in Gmail, you have to actually enable keyboard shortcuts
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   in order to use the J and K key.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.480]   And this has precedence in Vim,
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.520]   J and K moves your cursor up and down.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.640]   - No, do you think it's V-I that inspired this?
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   - You are a key. - You are a key.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   - You are a key.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.200]   - No, it's a brand new-- - It absolutely is.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.120]   - If they start doing EMAX key bindings,
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.480]   then I'm gonna be impressed.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.840]   (laughing)
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.120]   - I think so, I mean, I mean,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.800]   - No, it makes sense. - Yeah.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.360]   - J and K isn't easy to remember for your brain, right?
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.440]   But it's easy for your fingers,
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.600]   because if you're a touch typist,
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.280]   your forefinger rests on the J key,
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.000]   and a lot of keyboards, a J key has like a little nub on it.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.960]   So if you have your forefinger and your second finger,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.040]   you can move up and down a list in reader and Gmail.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.480]   And if you join that search experiment in search results.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.920]   And I have to tell you, once you start using J and K,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.400]   like you just can't, you won't ever go back.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.080]   - This is why Gina is the best.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.400]   (laughing)
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.760]   Something that little can make a huge difference.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.600]   That's fantastic.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.760]   I mean, I knew about it in Gmail,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.120]   but I didn't realize it extended to reader and search.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.560]   - Yeah, and there's a ton of other--
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.120]   - There's O-- - There's short cuts.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.440]   - Enter slash escape.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.280]   - Smarter my god. - Yes, and my god,
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.520]   both has links to all the rest of them as well.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.880]   - Wasn't it Control H the backspace
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.000]   from the old backspace? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.920]   - Yeah, yeah. - And Belle?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.440]   - Yeah. - Belle, Control G.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   If we can bring back Control G,
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.960]   I just wanna ring a bell.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.760]   - Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.600]   (laughing)
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.960]   - That's the one key that's gone.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.280]   And I guess probably that's all for the better.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.440]   Your stat of the week, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.520]   - So the number is 200,000.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.200]   I have a project for the,
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.480]   with the City University of New York
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.560]   Graduate School of the Journalism,
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.320]   where I teach in new business models for news,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.880]   there are some.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.640]   And the research we did,
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.200]   we're gonna present a lot of models
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.240]   at Aspen Institute on Monday.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.400]   And you can go to newsinnovation.com
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.280]   and watch me do it on Prezi, I hope,
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.680]   if you're not a jinx Leo.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.760]   But the most astounding number we found
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.360]   is that there are hyper and local bloggers
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.200]   who aren't necessarily good at business,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   who nonetheless are pulling in $200,000 a year in Africa.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.960]   And we believe that if a paper dies
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.520]   and there are metro wide networks
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.560]   and smaller networks and other things,
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.200]   we believe a hyper local blogger
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.880]   could be making up to $330,000 a year growth.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.640]   So it's a real business in a real new way,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.160]   as long as the newspapers don't think
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.360]   they own the entire market because they can't anymore.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.920]   So 200K, it's a wonderful number.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.840]   That's kind of the Lou Grant argument,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.840]   you're never gonna get any blogger to go
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.840]   sit in a city council meeting for every day,
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.400]   for three months, of course you are,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.000]   that's exactly what they do, they love it.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.240]   They're crazy what they love it.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.040]   200,000 a year, is that from,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   it must be Google AdSense, right?
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.560]   No, it's from selling to local advertisers
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   and we think that you could-- Interesting.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.040]   The services they sell to those advertisers.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.200]   And if you can bring in metro wide advertising
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.280]   and local networks and a little bit of e-commerce
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.920]   and other revenue, as I say, after three years
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.480]   we see a local blogger is making pretty easily
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.840]   $350,000, which doesn't sound insane
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.880]   when you realize that a community weekly paper
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.720]   in that market can pull in almost a million dollars
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.840]   a year in advertising.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.320]   - Wow, that's encouraging, that's really encouraging.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.920]   - At the journalism school where I teach,
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.440]   this made us realize that we damn well better offer a course
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.240]   and how to be a hyper local blogger.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.040]   - Yeah, well how do you be a hyper local blogger?
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.000]   'Cause I could use the money.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.520]   - You go cover that boring meeting.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.240]   (laughing)
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.400]   - You go to your own sales too though, it sounds like.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.040]   - I go sell, you go sell, but we're also looking
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.000]   at the notion of citizen sales.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.800]   That maybe the journalist doesn't sell,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.680]   but the neighbor down the way, the real true,
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.400]   has extra time on our hands, can sell the advertising
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.440]   and make a business out of that.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.600]   - Very exciting, thank goodness,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.720]   I'm really pleased to hear that.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.320]   My tip of the week very quickly,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.920]   we kind of started to talk about it a little bit,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.760]   and it's this new send to, actually it's my tool of the week,
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.880]   and a Google reader really deserves to be the tool.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.040]   There's so much in it, I can't break it down,
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.320]   I mean it's just out of control.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:54.360]   And this came from a blog, actually it's an Indian blog,
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.840]   I mean, Argual does it, he's an Indian blogger,
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.920]   it's an excellent blog called Digital Inspiration.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.320]   Kind of like, yeah, it's like a life hacker really, right?
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.480]   - Yeah, yeah, he was great, we linked to him all the time.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.120]   - Yeah, well life hacker linked to this,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.480]   download your Google reader stories as PDF,
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.680]   he describes how you can take this new send to button,
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.720]   this is kind of fascinating, 'cause it's only been out
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.440]   for what it came out this week, right, I think.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.280]   - Yep.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.760]   - And already people have got these great things you can do,
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.440]   and it's partly because Google made it open.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.880]   So send to started with a few basic social sites
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.400]   like Delicious of course, and Facebook,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.560]   they've added friend feed, I'm happy to say,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.800]   but you can easily add, save as PDF,
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.560]   using a PDF to mail system that's free,
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.040]   and also email this using a free email system
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.400]   that will email by the way, even if it's,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.320]   you know, it drives me crazy, hacker news,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.120]   could you please put the full text in your feed,
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120]   please, all they put is the headline,
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.240]   but if you get something like that,
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.960]   you use the email this, you'll get the whole blog post,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.400]   which is really nice, so using webtomail.com.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.960]   So take a look at, I'll put a link to what's already
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.920]   in our friend feed room and in our delicious notes.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.240]   By the way, our delicious tags,
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.080]   if you go to delicious.com/twit/twig,
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.600]   you'll see what Gina, Jeff, and I have tagged for the show,
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.920]   and we also put it into their conversations room,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.480]   which is friendfeed.com/twit-twig.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.080]   And in fact, your comments would be appreciated.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.680]   If you go in there, only Gina and I and Jeff
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.560]   can add stories to there, but anybody can comment
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.200]   on those stories, and it would really be great
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.120]   to get your comments on those.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.480]   - You know, well, there's an example,
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.920]   if we could just put up one place
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.320]   and it goes to all, wouldn't life be nicer?
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.440]   - Yeah, well, that's where aggregation has some power.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.280]   We gotta solve this.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.560]   In fact, Gina, I think you started a conversation there.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.880]   Is this the beginning of the distributed social web?
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.160]   I mean, that's really what we need, isn't it?
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   Some sort of distribution system, federation.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.440]   Reverse aggregation, it puts it in our hands.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.160]   So take a look at that.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.880]   The meat does a great job in explaining how to do this,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.120]   and it's really thanks to Google,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.360]   because they've added some very simple ways
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.160]   to add features in the settings.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.120]   It's in your settings page on your Google Reader.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.280]   And now our wish list.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.160]   Okay, you've had a chance to think,
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.600]   Anil, is there anything at all that you wish,
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.640]   Google would do?
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.360]   - That's a tough one to be on the spot for.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.360]   I feel like I wish they would bring together
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.440]   the 10 different services
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.080]   that are using my Google contacts list,
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.240]   and get the one guy or gal on each of those teams
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.360]   that owns the user experience
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.520]   and get them all in a room together,
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.280]   and have them kind of reconcile.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.560]   Have a little group hug and say,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.080]   this is one great list, and you're all using it.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.760]   Let's think about how it can have a good experience there.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.800]   - Do you have any insight into the corporate?
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.640]   Anybody?
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.600]   You wrote, "What would Google do, Jeff?"
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.280]   Anybody have any insight into why Google
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.840]   is so kind of schizophrenic and disjointed?
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.680]   Is it a corporate culture problem?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.600]   - My interest is, they've chosen to do it.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.080]   - That's Anil that says that's what they want.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.800]   - No. - You would agree, Jeff?
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.360]   - Yeah, I think so, and whether that's a feature
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.600]   or a bug, I don't know, but they've turned it into that, I think.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.880]   - Is it a 20% time that causes the problem?
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.320]   - And they've all got-- - No, it's more
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.560]   about management by chaos.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.880]   It's more about allowing creativity to occur,
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.800]   and with that comes chaos.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.720]   - Right.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.120]   - Yeah, it's the 80% time that it causes the problem.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.680]   I mean, I think there's this willingness to say,
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.760]   we're gonna let five people run off and be a team
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.400]   and do this, which is commendable,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.280]   and has great results, and as a result,
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.960]   also has this flip side, which is--
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.040]   - They're not talking. - They're not talking.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.920]   Yeah, Wave was created in Australia.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.600]   Gina, is there anything on your wish list
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.880]   as if I didn't know?
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.600]   - My wish is much more, it's sort of nuts and bolts.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.800]   I brought up the private feed thing in Google Reader.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.160]   There's also, and actually, Leo, you and I should talk
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.200]   about Gmail a little more.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.800]   There's a weird thing in Gmail.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.920]   Gmail doesn't support wildcard search.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.320]   So if I want to search for the subject line, thank you.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.840]   If I search for the THAN star, it doesn't come up.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.400]   So I'm all about these little nitty gritty features
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.760]   every once in a while, I run across these.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.320]   So wildcard search would be good in Gmail,
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.040]   as it would be language search.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.240]   - I hate to tell you, but in fact,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.720]   this was almost gonna be my tip.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   There's a new program just came out for the iPhone,
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.800]   I'm sorry to say, called Remail.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.880]   It's a very interesting idea.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.920]   This is a Y Combinator startup.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.560]   It downloads all your Gmail onto your iPhone
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.400]   and allows you to search it.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.880]   Now I don't call if it does wildcard,
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.960]   but it's very fast search.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.560]   And what's interesting is they're not downloading attachments.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.960]   They've got, I mean, I have several gigs on Gmail,
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   they got it into a couple hundred megabytes.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.480]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.200]   - Does it do, like, can you search from Gina?
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.520]   Does it do advanced operators, like just subjects
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.320]   or just run lines or that kind of thing?
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.760]   Or is it just a general cross-all fields kind of search?
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.640]   - It looks like it's a cross-all field search.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.320]   So it would be nice to have some Boolean and some wildcards.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.840]   But at least I now, you know,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.040]   'cause everything's stored in my email.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.200]   - So it works with any IMAP server.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.480]   I use fast mail, not Gmail, and it works fine.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.160]   But now it does take a while to that first download.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.880]   - It takes a little, you'll leave it on overnight.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.720]   - Yeah, I think--
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.040]   - It's funny, there's so much focus on searching email
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.840]   and Gmail search is pretty good.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.720]   I wish I could search by instant messages,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.520]   the ones that aren't on G-talk.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.360]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.680]   - I get as much information through instant messenger
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.160]   as I do through email and--
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.920]   - And you save all the conversations?
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.440]   - I save all the logs, but searching them is a pain in the butt
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.600]   and I certainly can't do it on my phone.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.880]   - I bet you Gina could write you a text command
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.960]   that would do the problem.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.800]   (laughing)
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.000]   - I think that solves the problem for everything.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.320]   I mean, having a genius at hand doesn't say--
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.120]   - A little said, a little aok, a little grip.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.440]   - If you got it all, there's no promise.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.360]   Can we get a bash shell command here?
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.040]   - I'll send you guys a check later on this.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.640]   (laughing)
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.240]   - You know you could do it, you're just holding out on us.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.480]   - I actually think the convention is when you do a program
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.080]   for me, I'm supposed to send you the check,
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.920]   but I don't know.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.080]   (laughing)
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.400]   I don't know how your system works,
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   maybe Google's got you.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.720]   - This could be a better one, I like it.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.680]   Yeah, it's the new Gina Trapani system.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.000]   I gotta wish, I got two wishes.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.080]   First send me this gosh darn wave invite.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.000]   I'm ready, I'm waiting.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.480]   Hurry up, I guess they're gonna send out
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.720]   a bunch in September, right?
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.960]   100,000 in September?
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.760]   - I think that they have been sending out,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.920]   sending the malcon of in waves.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.760]   I heard there was sort of a battery.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.320]   "Easantly, Leo, you don't have an invite,
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.440]   "I thought you said you tried it."
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.560]   - I tried it with a friend who had an invite.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.400]   - Ah.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.480]   - Not the same, but the point is,
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.320]   if you don't send out invites to a lot of people,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.840]   it's pointless anyway, as you would--
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.440]   - 'Cause Leo, we're all in a wave together.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.280]   - Oh, shut up.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.120]   (laughing)
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.880]   Shut up, I know you are, I could just tell.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.480]   Except everything is changing so fast,
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.920]   I have no idea what's going on in the wave,
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.560]   so I'm just gonna talk to you guys.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.920]   (laughing)
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.160]   - It is, it's like all moving at once.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   I don't, it's gonna be a squirmy kind of feeling
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   when you have 80 people.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.240]   - Crazy thing.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.320]   (laughing)
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.840]   - There gonna be 80 people in a wave,
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.200]   and it's just gonna be,
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.720]   (sighing)
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.200]   that's why I wanna see what it looks like.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.320]   My second one is, you know, voice is so great.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.520]   Google voice is so great,
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.320]   and those of us who have it have been singing its praises.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.040]   I know they're starting to send out invites.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.760]   I wanna get one from my family,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.120]   my wife and kids.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.080]   I want my kids to have one phone number now
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.760]   that they keep for the rest of their life,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.000]   and it sounds like voice would be a good way to do that.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.760]   So let's get those invites out to Google.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.960]   Let's start, in fact, you know,
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.920]   you could let us invite friends, that'd be nice.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.400]   Just a little invite button on there.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.160]   Jeff, do you have a wish?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.200]   - Well, I agree with you, Leo.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.320]   I wanna wave invite,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.360]   and then listening to the conversation about reader,
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   I think they've got to hire a designer from Apple.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.600]   - Yes.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.960]   - They've lost their simplicity in other areas,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.760]   and they got to find a way to regain the Zen.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.680]   - I would rather they hire a designer from Flickr.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.680]   I think Yahoo's gotta be bleeding good.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.760]   - Might be available, right?
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.520]   - I think that would be too hard.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.160]   - Flickr has that game feeling to it,
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.600]   what you were talking about earlier,
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.360]   like a reward structure,
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.400]   Flickr was built on a game platform,
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.600]   and it shows, there's rewards all over the place,
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   and reader has chores all over the place.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.600]   - Flickr was built on a game platform, I didn't know that.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   - Yeah, yeah, game never ending was what Ludicor built originally,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   and then turned very quickly into a photo sharing service,
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   and so it's mechanisms and mechanics,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   it's reward structure.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   - How did you know that?
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   - It was as accidental as Walker was, yeah.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   - Yeah.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   - Well, they missed a bet.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   They could have hired Paul and company from Friendsfeed.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   I think they could have turned reader into something, but.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   - Except none of us here could figure out Friendsfeed.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   - None of us here could figure out Friendsfeed.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   - Oh, that's true.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   - And we all use reader every day, isn't that telling?
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   - Yeah, we still use it.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   (laughing)
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   - All right, hey, what a great show,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   and he'll thank you so much for being a part of it today.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.600]   - Thanks, this has been a blast.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600]   I've been fans of all of you for forever,
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   so I'm geeked out just to be here.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   - Well, we're gonna get you back.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   There's no question about it.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600]   We really appreciate you taking the time.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   Anil is Vice President at Six Apart,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   and he blogs at dashesdashes.com.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   That's his.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   He owns it.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600]   Don't you dare mess with it.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   It's his place on the web.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600]   - I dare ya.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   - I dare ya.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Knock this dash off my shoulder.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.600]   Gina Trapani, thank you so much.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   Always a pleasure to have you on.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   I look forward to doing a lot more with you.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   Smarterware.org is a place we can get her to write a command line
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   utility to do anything.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.600]   - Thank you so much.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   - Anything at all.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600]   - This is really fun, too.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   - Oh, so much fun.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you for being here at BuzzMachine.com.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   Go get your pizza.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.600]   - We'll do.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.600]   - Thanks for being with us.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   A little program note.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.600]   We will start the show a little bit early from now on so that
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.600]   Jeff does get pizza night on Saturday.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   So if you want to watch us do this live, you can live.twit.tv.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   It'll be starting at 215 Pacific.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.600]   That's 515 Eastern time every Saturday.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   And we're gonna have a whole new studio the next time we're on.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.600]   So thank you all for being here.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.600]   - Wow.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   - The new audio board system comes in.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   It's all digital.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.600]   I don't know if it's gonna be better or worse.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   We'll see.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.600]   It could be the Google reader of audio systems.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.600]   I don't know.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   Very nervous.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.600]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:56.600]   [MUSIC]
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.180]   (upbeat music)
