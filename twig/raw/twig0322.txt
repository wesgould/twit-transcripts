[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.940]   Jeff Jarvis has the day off, but Mike Gellkins here,
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.500]   Barry Schwartz from SearchEngineLand.com.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.940]   Why did Twitter appoint a Google stalwart to run the board?
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.340]   I have some theories.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.240]   We'll also talk about notifications,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   both new notifications from a new Facebook app
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.240]   and no notifications from Chrome.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.180]   A lot to talk about, and you got it.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.180]   Coming up next, it's on Twig.
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.400]   NetCasts you love.

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.340]   It's time for TWIG this week in Google.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.660]   Jeff Jarvis is traveling and unavailable today,
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.420]   but that's not anything to worry about,
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.260]   because look who we have.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.700]   Mike Elgin, news director at TWIT.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.140]   Now that's something to worry about.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.700]   And for the first time you've been on this show,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.220]   you're using a computer.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.060]   It's a computer.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.140]   It has a keyboard.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.620]   I figure everybody's doing it.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.420]   You're using a Mac.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.260]   Is this a new Mac?
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.940]   Or you just decided not to use your pixel?
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.740]   This is the Mac.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.180]   I like to switch it around.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.940]   But this is, frankly, I'm too lazy
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900]   to come up with a novel device to use.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.820]   I'm just using my regular laptop.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.700]   Also here, and I don't know what he's using.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220]   Barry Schwartz from Search Engine Land.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.380]   Great to have you here as well.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.260]   Great to be here.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.780]   Big honor.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.260]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.460]   Oh, no honor at all.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.460]   We're honored to have you.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.020]   We love Search Engine Land.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.540]   I'm using a Mac also.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.700]   Oh, shoot.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.980]   Me too.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.460]   What are we doing this week in Google?
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.380]   This is crazy.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.620]   Let's just make a Mac break weekly and be done with it.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.500]   Google send us a gross of pixels.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.540]   And we'll all be using those.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.980]   Actually, I'm really-- and I was talking about this before
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.980]   the show.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.140]   I'm waiting in a couple of weeks.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.060]   I'll have the new Microsoft Surface Book.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.820]   And I'm actually seriously thinking,
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.660]   I'm going to try to use it full time for a month.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.700]   Like not use Windows for a month.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.940]   That is a challenge for me as a Mac user for many decades.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.420]   Yep.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.140]   But we'll see.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.020]   We'll see.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.900]   I just-- I feel like Windows 10 is pretty nice.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.700]   And I'm really looking forward to using the stylus
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.180]   and the touch.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180]   And I also feel like once you get used to using touch,
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.260]   you want to touch the screen.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.700]   I find myself touching the screen a lot.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.540]   And I think this is--
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.620]   But the Pixel, that's one of the things I love about the Pixel.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.060]   And it's funny because this is like the Pixel.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.820]   It's three by two.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.300]   Yep.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.500]   So the 16.9.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.860]   What I want, they have the big Chrome bases.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.180]   They're giant screens.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.540]   They're designed to be popular.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.380]   Well, yeah, we reviewed it before you buy.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.980]   And it's so close to being the perfect computer for me.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.380]   Because it's just too low.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.500]   It's too slow.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.620]   I need the Pixel version of that.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.780]   The high-res, beautiful screen, fast performance version
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.060]   of that, and I'm done.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.900]   That would be the computer I would use full time.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.820]   Well, not full time because it's not mobile.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.340]   Microsoft's Surface Book is the same size as a Pixel.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.180]   13-inch screen.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.340]   But it's higher resolution.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.500]   It's 3,000 by 2,000.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.620]   Yeah, it's a beautiful--
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.340]   So that's--
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.580]   I'd be interested to see how that is.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.060]   I mean, I think the Pixel looks great.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.060]   The only thing I'm worried about--
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.380]   and you can confirm whether this is a problem or not
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.500]   problem with the Surface Book is whether or not,
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.740]   when you rip off the-- well, you detach the top.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.420]   You look at it three hours with the tablet.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.620]   Yeah, that's a lie.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.220]   That's just a tablet.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.540]   Forget about the keyboard.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.420]   The worst battery life of any tablet.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.980]   We talked about that on Windows Weekly.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.060]   And Paul was of the opinion that the reason they did that
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.580]   is if they had put enough battery in there to go longer,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.300]   it would have been tippy.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.820]   And so they really wanted--
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.980]   that's why the weird hinge.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.820]   They really wanted it to be stable.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.620]   A lot of touch screens, you start touching the screen.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.940]   They actually fall over.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.420]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.580]   I haven't had that problem with the Pixel.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.180]   That's a big heavy thing.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.020]   But if they put more battery in the lid, apparently,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.020]   it would just make it top heavy.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.380]   And also, remember, you can detach it,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.660]   flip it around, and close it so that then you get all 12 hours.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.540]   You have to carry around the big bottom part.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.580]   So you only get the three-hour battery life
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.140]   when you insist on the super thin tablet.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.940]   Otherwise, you can use it as a tablet
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940]   and still get 12 hours of battery life.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.780]   It's also, I think, has to be said that they did all kinds
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.020]   of engineering gymnastics to make sure it wouldn't tip over,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.860]   especially with the hinge.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.820]   The whole point of the hinge--
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.660]   The hinge is why.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.700]   Nobody understands this unless you've been watching
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.020]   a Windows weekly.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.540]   But what it does is it makes the bottom of the back
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.300]   go back further so that it doesn't tip over,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300]   so that the hinge sort of unrolls
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.860]   so the actual distance from the very front of what's
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.300]   on the table to what's the back of what's on the table
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.900]   is an extra inch.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.420]   Right.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.980]   So that's what that hinge does.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.100]   And everybody wonders why the crazy hinge.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100]   But that's what it's all about.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.860]   It also looks pretty cool.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.300]   It's pretty cool.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.100]   Which you can't deny.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.700]   Now, I feel like the Crumbop Pixel is, in many ways,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.140]   a perfect computer.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.380]   So I'll be interested to see.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.220]   I think 3x2 is not a bad thing.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.540]   We're so used to wide screens now.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.820]   But I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.820]   Google buys ABCDEFGHIJKELEMINA PQRSTUVWXYZ.com.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.220]   For some reason.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.340]   Yeah, because it's not live now.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.020]   If you go there, nothing happens.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.580]   I just think they're crazy.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.340]   That explains it.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.340]   They're not.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.940]   Well, hey, Larry Page had an extra $10 in his pocket.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.260]   They are called Alphabet, after all.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.340]   And they had to use xyz.com.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.980]   Which is kind of-- or no, what was it?
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.500]   What is it?
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.180]   It's ABC.xyz.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.260]   .xyz.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.940]   Which I think is a little easier to type than ABCDEFGHIJKE.
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.220]   I, for one, would prefer that they use this one, the long one.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.900]   Nobody's going to go to Alphabet anyway.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.340]   All the products and stuff like that
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.580]   are on the individual company websites.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.940]   So why not?
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.420]   Just do it.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.180]   It'll really make them stand out.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.060]   That's my advice to you, Larry Page and Sergey Brann
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.460]   and all the rest of you.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.020]   Barry, when you say the whole alphabet, you don't sing it.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.340]   Do you?
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.900]   I do not sing a period, so--
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.500]   I find myself going ABCDEFGHIJKELEMINA PQRSTUV--
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.940]   The programming worked.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.420]   It did.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.780]   It does.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.140]   And that's a great way to remember what comes first.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.420]   It's like, well, does P come before?
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.260]   I don't remember if so.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.660]   I'm just going to sing this.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.540]   But I can't do a second, yeah.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.540]   Yeah, of course.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.220]   The domain was created in 1999 by somebody.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.700]   Google updated on Wednesday.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.740]   They took control of it according to the WhoIs domain database.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.020]   The most boring possible explanation
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.540]   is they just didn't want anyone else to own it.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.260]   And so they're going to--
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.340]   I think--
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.220]   They wanted the headline, Google buys Alphabet.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.680]   Right.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.740]   Plus or cheap.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.900]   Plus, they lost Google.com for now.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.180]   Why would you hook it up to something?
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.420]   I mean, come on, Google.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.860]   That's a strange oversight.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.860]   Twitter, who owed it before head?
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.060]   No, do you?
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.820]   I don't know.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.980]   And why they owned it?
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.940]   Probably some--
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.180]   Probably some Joe bought it.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.580]   And just, you know.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.980]   But someday, Google will name itself Alphabet,
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.020]   and then I'll be able to sell this for millions.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.740]   Google does own more than 18,000 domains.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.220]   Wow.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.900]   And they are a domain registrar themselves.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.460]   So I doubt they actually had to buy it.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.420]   They just took it.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.460]   They just took it.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.140]   We're Google.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.980]   We're Alphabet.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.540]   How does that work?
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.980]   Does I can get a cut?
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.220]   It must get a cut.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.900]   How does that work?
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.060]   Because I can--
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.860]   makes you a registrar.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.980]   You have to be ICANN approved.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.020]   Otherwise, you can register.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.340]   No name names, but nobody will know.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.820]   Presumably, the Google domain registry is ICANN.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.380]   Do they kick back to ICANN?
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.340]   They must kick like a buck back to ICANN.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.020]   Got to be.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.580]   Got to be.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.020]   Otherwise, domains, you'd be able to get them for two bucks,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.220]   right?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   Right.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.540]   Exactly.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.180]   There's got to be some amount that ICANN gets.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:51.540]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.220]   There's got to be a wholesale price.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.540]   Barry, did you know that when you got on this show,
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.100]   we'd be talking about dopey stuff like this?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.700]   Yeah, I've watched a couple of times.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.180]   Oh, you knew.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.620]   Oh, good.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.900]   OK.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.540]   There was a guy who bought google.com.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.380]   He bought it for 12 bucks.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:17.060]   He owned it for one minute before somebody noticed.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.780]   A guy was a student and a former Google employee, San
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.580]   May Vedd, he bought google.com due to an administrative issue
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.500]   at the search giant, according to CNBC.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.900]   He was surprised, as one might be, to find the name of Brazil.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.380]   When he bought it, the $12 transaction went through.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.300]   And ownership of the site was transferred.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.620]   And he had access to the webmaster tools for google.com.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.460]   Are you kidding?
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.980]   No.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.540]   That's cold.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.580]   He could have deadexed the whole entire site.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.700]   Holy cow.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.860]   So now, recently, he's been given a bug bounty
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.860]   by Google's security team for revealing the weakness
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.340]   in the domain buying system.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.420]   Is it really a weakness?
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.500]   I mean, they released the name.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.620]   It sounds like somebody just--
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.300]   The weakness was Joe in accounting who's no longer there.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.820]   He's been sent to the Russia Front programming
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.020]   floor.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.940]   So he had it only for about a minute before the purchase
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.500]   was canceled.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.460]   But what a minute.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.300]   What a great minute.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.540]   What a thrilling minute that must have been.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.140]   I own google.com.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.460]   And he did it through the Google domain service.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.660]   Yeah, he actually donated the money
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.980]   that Google gave it back to some charity.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.460]   Oh, nice.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.300]   And Google doubled it because he did that.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.820]   So it's a very happy ending here.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.860]   Oh, gosh, that would be fun.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.100]   Just to own for a minute.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.600]   Google.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.940]   I'm the man who owned google.com.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.660]   Just for a minute.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.860]   Nobody used, apparently, the notification
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.140]   center in Chrome.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.980]   So they took it out.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.620]   Actually, I found it very annoying
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.860]   because you'd go to a page, say the Verge,
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.980]   and it would say, would you like
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.660]   to allow notifications because you have to permit it?
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.700]   And you'd say that.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.900]   And then in addition to the OS notifications
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.900]   you're getting, which are annoying enough,
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.060]   you'd be getting notifications from your browser.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.820]   And then when you wanted notifications,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.540]   they would happen while you were sleeping.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.140]   And then you come back and they were gone.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.140]   And so I just think this is one of those features
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.980]   that nobody really cared about.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.260]   Nobody noticed.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.300]   Nobody knew it was there.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.860]   In fact, the majority of people listening to this
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.380]   and watching this show are like, there
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.780]   was a notification center.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.860]   I mean, this was really under the radar.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.580]   And while it's gone now, it'll be removed from Windows, Mac,
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.260]   and Linux in the next version of Chrome.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260]   However, you'll still have it in Chrome OS
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.140]   because the OS itself has no notification capabilities.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.220]   So this is how it does.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:46.780]   Right.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.780]   Yeah, Barry?
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.740]   This is a very common thing.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.820]   Google's constantly releasing new cool things.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.420]   And then a year or two later, just saying nobody actually
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.060]   started using it.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.660]   So we're going to ditch it and try something else.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.220]   So it's not unheard of from Google.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.580]   They're constantly doing these types of things.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.340]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.980]   Don't you think it hurts them a little bit?
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.300]   Because, for instance, a developer in order
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.220]   to use this would have to put the code into the app,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.580]   saying use the notification center.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.860]   And that's some work.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.580]   And I think every time Google does one of these things
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.940]   and pulls back on it--
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.620]   I understand why shouldn't they prune useless branches.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.140]   But I feel like developers might then
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.820]   be less likely to try something out the next time, like AMP.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.980]   What's going to happen is that they're
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.820]   going to--
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.380]   notifications are going to result in an error.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.500]   And so this is going to be--
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   Now I have to fix my code.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.060]   Is that true?
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.260]   Is there going to be an error now?
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:38.760]   Yes.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.620]   That's what Google says.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.500]   And API events tied to the center will no longer fire.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.140]   So I'm not really clear on exactly what the effect will be.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.100]   But I guess we'll hear about this when it's really implemented.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.100]   So yeah.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.100]   And Google does have a reputation for killing things
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.660]   that small numbers of people really love.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.780]   And of course, Google Reader being the biggest example of that.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.060]   So everybody's really worried about everything Google does.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.340]   And nobody really feels like they can jump in with all fours
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.060]   into things like this.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.540]   Because it's just who knows what they're capable of.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.620]   Who knows what these people are capable of?
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.500]   Just today, they also announced that the Ajax crawling
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.660]   schema for webmasters is no longer being recommended
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.780]   and they're getting rid of it.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.900]   So that's another example.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.420]   And they're constantly doing these things.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.300]   And they're constantly releasing new things,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.020]   like app indexing and the AMP thing we're talking about.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.580]   So the question to me is always, should we
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.460]   go ahead and invest in these technologies?
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.540]   And I used to be the first.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.820]   I used to be the first implement everything Google said.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.420]   And then when app indexing came out and AMP came out,
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.060]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.940]   I'll just wait a little bit to see what happens.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.900]   What's the Ajax thing?
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.700]   Does that mean crawling Ajax pages?
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.940]   So Google has been getting much better at crawling--
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.700]   Java scripts.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.860]   --age X web pages over time.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.100]   And they used to have this protocol back in 2009
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.340]   to assist Google's crawlers, Googlebot,
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.740]   to crawl Ajax-related content.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.660]   So you actually had to hack your website
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.740]   if it was built in Ajax with different codes
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.940]   to enable Google's spiders to actually crawl
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.820]   through your Ajax website.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.980]   Google said today that they are no longer supporting
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.340]   that proposal because they're good enough at indexing
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.060]   real Ajax websites without that hack.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   And they're telling people to remove that code
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.460]   and just build it all the way.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.540]   Oh.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.100]   Well, you're not going to get an error, are you?
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.140]   No, you won't get an error.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.220]   The question is, will your site be indexed in the future?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.500]   Oh, nice.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.060]   I don't see.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.820]   I used to see all the time errors
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.580]   from crawling JavaScript sites.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.380]   Like you'd see in the site description would say,
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.140]   this site requires JavaScript, things like that.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.500]   But I don't see those much anymore.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.900]   Is that because Google's gotten better at crawling sites that
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.540]   are not HTML?
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.060]   Exactly.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.340]   Google's much better at crawling sites that are not HTML.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.300]   Plus, Google will sometimes--
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.980]   you have a website that just has a search box or something,
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.300]   kind of like the Google homepage.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.820]   They might go ahead and actually enter content.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.420]   Just to get behind the content to get in there
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.700]   so they can start crawling the site.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.420]   So it's actually much better to tech you that stuff.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.940]   The reason I mention that is our website is all in Node.js.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.740]   So if you view the source code on our site,
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.020]   it's not a lot of content.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.660]   It's all JavaScript.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.940]   I mean, it gets rendered by the time, actually, when you view it,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.500]   you're seeing HTML.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.220]   But what Google might see when it crawls the site is probably
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.340]   not what you're going to see when you surf the site.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.460]   So that's always been-- in my mind, go,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.580]   is that a cause for concern?
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.260]   But I guess not.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.260]   Google's smart enough to--
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.860]   It's not.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.300]   If you render it--
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.340]   Go into Google Search Console, and you actually
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.220]   do a render of your website.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.020]   I'm sure it actually looks like what you see it now.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.660]   Google-- no longer--
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.020]   Googlebot's actually now able to see what the user sees
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.980]   for the most part, except for Flash and certain other technologies.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.660]   But for the most part, they're able to see the actual website
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.060]   as a user would see it.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.380]   So that's interesting.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.340]   Crawl errors-- yeah, so this is part of the Webmaster Tools.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.020]   Is this the search appearance thing?
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.820]   So go to crawl, I think.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.780]   OK, crawl.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.940]   Crawl errors, crawl sets.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.380]   That's Googlebot.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.100]   Fetch is Google.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.020]   So this will show me what a page--
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.220]   Look how the fetch and render button for your desktop.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.540]   The big red button in the middle.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.260]   Fetch and render.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.100]   And then--
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.660]   It's trying.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.300]   Then once it goes, it's going to give you a little link to click on it.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.780]   Oh, I see.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   It says, pending redirected redirect.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.860]   So this is, by the way, something we've
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.340]   been kind of banging on, because as you can see,
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.100]   Google has not been doing a good job of indexing our site.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.740]   And it's because we moved to a new site.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.980]   And I think we did something wrong.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.140]   So stuff is not getting redirected.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.060]   Oh, yay, yay.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.140]   I shouldn't probably be doing the--
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.260]   Yeah, see.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.500]   Getting a redirect.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.460]   Oh, I know why, because I did HTTP, not HTTPS.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.540]   What a mess.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.540]   Trying to do the right thing, because Google says,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.580]   make it HTTPS, and will index you better.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.260]   But then it's a mess.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.580]   You have to go ahead and verify your site on the HTTPS side.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.580]   Ah.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.060]   Did you get that, Patrick?
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.220]   Verify on HTTPS.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.220]   Barry from Search Engine Land says so.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.660]   Maybe that might be what was wrong all along.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.380]   So we verified it, obviously, in the old days under HTTP.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.100]   Now that we're HTTPS, we need to re-verify.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.380]   Right.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.980]   The trick for webmasters when they're moving to HTTPS,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.780]   if you do it for Google reasons or for security reasons,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.500]   is you keep your HTTP profile there,
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.140]   and you add your HTTPS profile into Google.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.540]   And then you'll be able to see, as Google starts
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.860]   to de-index the HTTP version, you'll
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.540]   see your index count in Google Search Console drastically
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.220]   go down.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.220]   And at the same time, the HTTPS index count
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.340]   will drastically go up.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.380]   And that's basically a tool for webmasters to follow that.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.500]   This web stuff's so complicated.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.180]   By the way, I see that we have some very nice ASCII art
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.620]   in our robots.txt.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.100]   Very nice.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.180]   Somebody spent a lot of time doing ASCII art
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.060]   in our robots.txt file.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.260]   Wonder who did that.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.020]   Is that you, Patrick?
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.780]   Yeah, everybody who has a website should obviously
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.260]   be using google.com/webmasters.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.900]   And those webmaster tools are fabulous.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.540]   We've had, of course, the guy who for years
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.420]   was making those videos was Matt Cots.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.780]   Very, really great stuff.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.940]   This is useful stuff.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.340]   Very someday we should do a show you
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.420]   could explain what all this crap means to me.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.180]   Sure, no doubt.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:07.940]   Look at all this.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.780]   Holy cow.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.620]   Um, Google has filed paperwork with the Federal Aviation
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.540]   Administration for two new drones, unmanned aerial vehicles,
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.100]   UAVs, and gadgets spotted these.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.460]   There's one already, which is the Google drone delivery
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.780]   project, Project Wing.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.700]   But it turns out this is not for Project Wing.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.860]   This is from Project Titan.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.380]   Not to be confused with Apple's car project called Project Titan.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.780]   Oh, you're right.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.860]   Oddly enough, they think there are a bunch of titans.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.060]   They are titans of industry.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.180]   They are titans of the tech industry.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.660]   Yeah, so this is their very high flying solar powered drone
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.740]   program that is--
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.940]   So it's for internet.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.940]   It's internet access.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.220]   Yes, exactly.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.620]   And so part of this story--
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.700]   This competes with Loon.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.260]   Well, this is an alternative to Loon
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.580]   and competes with Facebook's internet.org high flying drone
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.460]   delivery system.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.140]   But either way, it's really cool.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.220]   And what's interesting about this, in part,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.140]   is the fact that they are going to be testing in the US, which
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.780]   has been difficult for a lot of companies.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.180]   They also have a great relationship with NASA.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.980]   They manage Moffatt field right near their headquarters,
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.380]   which has a lot of opportunities to test drones indoors
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.740]   because the building is so large.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.420]   It's a dirgable hangar from the--
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.820]   It's an old dirgable hangar.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.700]   So this is the kind of news you hear about this.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.940]   And you need to know more, but there are no details to be had.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.380]   Other than the fact that it exists, there's two of them.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.220]   On paper, they look identical.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.540]   The FAA requires cryptic information
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.460]   about each of the drones.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.980]   And there are two of them, and both have exactly the same numbers
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.100]   in every single field.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.260]   So we don't know the difference between these two.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.180]   They could be identical.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.660]   There's just two physical vehicles.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.740]   But who knows?
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.220]   Who knows what's going on?
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.180]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.140]   When I saw this story, I sort of started
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.620]   looking around at the job boards,
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.940]   the kind of people they're hiring,
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.780]   all the stuff they're doing around drones.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.420]   And they're staffing up big time around this.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.380]   They've got a New Mexico facility where they're
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.900]   doing a lot of drone development.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.940]   Literally under the radar, I guess you would say,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.060]   or in this case, over the radar.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.660]   Because the altitude on these things is so high.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.860]   But this is really exciting.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.340]   And meanwhile, they are still working on delivery drones.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.220]   So that's how cool would it be if they actually
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.500]   went ahead and made real-time Google Street views.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.260]   Yeah, that'd be cool.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.340]   And the funny thing is, if you look at the type of jobs
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.100]   that they're hiring for, they are building these aircraft
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.060]   completely from scratch.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.780]   They're hiring materials people, people who are
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.340]   specialists in wing design.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.860]   They're hiring-- they're doing it all.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.780]   And it's really fascinating.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.980]   I don't wonder why they wouldn't just buy off the shelf drones.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   I don't know.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.780]   Maybe nothing like that exists.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.500]   Or just rent them from Facebook.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.820]   Yeah, it's not like the drone is the product.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.380]   It's like a cell tower.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.380]   You're not going to--
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.100]   It's kind of how Google works, though, isn't it?
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.780]   Well, I think they get dissatisfied with the pace.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.940]   And they can throw money in engineering, talent at things.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.740]   For example, Project Loon's a perfect example.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.460]   People have been doing ballooning and doing some of the things
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.100]   that they've been working, the navigation of the balloons,
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.380]   and so on for a long, long time.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.420]   But when Google got involved and really started
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.740]   pouring Google money at it, they were shattering records
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.980]   for how long a balloon could stay aloft after decades
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.940]   of research facilities and all kinds of other people
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.140]   working on how do you keep balloons aloft for a long period
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:53.900]   of time.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.700]   And so they really just accelerate the development of this.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.060]   Because of course, if they just waited for off the shelf
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.580]   parts to serve their particular needs,
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.460]   they would probably have to wait a lot longer.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.780]   Off the shelf drones.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.060]   Off the shelf drones, exactly.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.500]   This is one actually that Barry says is going to affect him.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.820]   I didn't know that you have a cloud service called Shul
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.820]   Cloud.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.780]   Is this for synagogues?
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.620]   Yeah, it's a synagogue management platform that's completely
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.740]   web-based.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.540]   How cool is that?
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.660]   So you say that this might--
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.700]   we talked about this last week.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.860]   The new safe harbor ruling or the overturn of the safe harbor
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:45.180]   ruling in the EU means that if you're a data provider in the EU,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.020]   you have to adhere to laws of each of the individual countries.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.380]   So that would impact you.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.020]   So you do have operations outside of the US?
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.780]   It's not physical operations, but I have customers that use--
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.980]   I have synagogues in the UK and different EU regions that
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.300]   are paying a monthly service fee to use this service.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.140]   And part of that includes a storing data,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.500]   collecting financial data, donations, membership data,
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.460]   and so forth.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:21.100]   And a lot of the EU, mostly based in London,
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.060]   are saying, well, we need something from you now
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.500]   that the EU safe harbor ruling has been overturned.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.860]   So what do I do?
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.500]   And then I'm pointing to Amazon, Salesforce, Google.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.580]   And they're all using this type of model clauses.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.020]   But it's much more complicated for me to implement that
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.820]   because I don't really have the infrastructure, the legal
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.540]   background, and so forth to do that.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.900]   And my lawyer is not so aware of what to do.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.900]   So it's not that easy for me to actually implement.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.500]   So we--
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.580]   You're not alone, apparently.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.900]   Even the EU is not sure what it means.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.260]   But what if you were just--
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.300]   what if you just moved to Europe?
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.660]   Would that solve this problem?
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.420]   No.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.340]   And bring your servers with you?
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.060]   I don't think some of the options
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.420]   are to have a representative based in Europe, which
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.260]   makes it easier.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.100]   But I still think it doesn't solve.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.860]   I don't know.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.500]   Honestly, I'm just--
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.380]   I got an email from three of the synagogues in London area
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.060]   and saying, what do we do now?
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.580]   I'm like, just trust us.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.460]   We're OK.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.260]   And they're like, no, it's not good enough.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.340]   So I'm figuring out what to do right now.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.180]   Huh.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.580]   Interesting problem.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.140]   Apparently, there's a debate, even within the EU,
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.580]   about what it means.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.580]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.500]   This is from an article at Data Center Knowledge.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.820]   There are two schools of thought.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.540]   One school of thought is that safe harbor is dead.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.700]   And that means that there's no protection
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.140]   for overseas data center operators like you, Barry.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.020]   You just have to adhere to the laws
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.260]   of the various countries you're in.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.100]   The other-- and according to David Snead,
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.900]   who's the co-founder and attorney
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.940]   with the internet infrastructure coalition, which
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.060]   is a US kind of industry group that includes Google, Amazon,
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:08.300]   and Equinix, says that he thinks that the European Union
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.940]   and the European Commission in particular have to just figure
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.380]   out how to interpret it.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.420]   That there needs to be some new policy.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.140]   So meanwhile, Barry and people like him just don't know what
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.420]   to do.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.340]   It's unrealistic to think Snead says
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.220]   that all transatlantic data is going
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.980]   to have to stop as a result of this decision.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.780]   That certainly would be an impact that the EU would not
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.300]   like.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.500]   The European Commission is likely
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.100]   to figure out a way to accommodate it and the US as well.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.260]   So in other words, he's saying he's probably right.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.380]   There's no need to panic.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.060]   What are you going to do, Barry?
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.220]   Panic.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.100]   I asked my clients-- I asked my clients.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.660]   I sent a gone client there to just hold off.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.380]   Give me a couple months to start doing it and we'll figure it out.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.540]   So you're not going to allow overseas customers?
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540]   Well, they're just signing up.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.140]   I'm not stopping them from signing up.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.940]   I just don't know if they can't use it.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.700]   They could use it.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.740]   I think it leaves the liability on them versus on me.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.580]   And they don't want that.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.180]   I believe.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.740]   I could be completely wrong.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.740]   But according to New York law, I
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.020]   don't have to do anything until the end of 2016.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.460]   If they want to sign up, I'm not liable for anything.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.940]   Oh, good.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.740]   Of course, I'm sure the EU does not recognize New York law.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.220]   I know.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.180]   So good luck.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.300]   Have fun.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.420]   And you thought it was a good idea.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.820]   Just a little business on the side.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.500]   Exactly.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.380]   Actually, it's really cool.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.180]   When did you start that?
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.860]   We started this about three and a half years ago, almost four years ago,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.420]   just for my own synagogue.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.220]   And then all the other synagogues in the area
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.980]   started wanting it.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.460]   And now we have close to four.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.180]   And the synagogue is using it across the world.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:48.860]   It's pretty insane.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.740]   And what does it manage?
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.580]   It's basically when you have members signed up to your synagogue,
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.820]   they get dues.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.740]   They get monthly dues.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.540]   And they get different honors they give to their shul.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.740]   And they pay different things.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.180]   And they get reminded about family birthdays and death notices.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.100]   And remember--
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.820]   Don't forget to buy your Rosh Hashanah tickets.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.860]   Things like that.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.340]   Exactly.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.660]   High holiday, Rosh Hashanah tickets.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.980]   Very important.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.020]   Get those tickets early.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.580]   That's cool.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.300]   That's a really interesting-- you wrote it just as a service
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.820]   for your own temple.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.940]   Yeah, like most software companies start as like, hey, you--
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.980]   Scratch your own niche.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.820]   There's a need for it.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.580]   You built it.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.700]   And it's filling a need.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.620]   What's it written in?
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.340]   It's mostly-- it's PHP MySQL.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.220]   And it's on Amazon.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.380]   It's AWS service.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.900]   AWS.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.700]   Do you think AWS-- I mean, that would be in an Amazon's
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.500]   interest, wouldn't it, as a provider of these services.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.140]   There's a billion dollar business we now know for Amazon.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.820]   It would be smart of them to act on behalf of all their
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.340]   customers and kind of go to the EU and say, OK, we've got all
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.980]   these guys doing this.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.140]   What do we do?
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.580]   So I think Amazon has their thing directly with--
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.940]   but I don't think it covers everything for the provider.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.620]   So I would sign up.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.460]   I would pay $1,000 plus dollars per-- whatever it costs
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.020]   to have a third party verify whatever I need to verify and
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.580]   confirm that I'm compliant, like you have with PCI, HIPAA.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.300]   All these verification servers, I would pay for that.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.500]   And we hope that's all that would be required.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.380]   Although part of the problem is that, for instance,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.620]   Germany has much more draconian laws than, say, England.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.260]   And so I presume this means you'd have to be--
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.620]   I don't know, compliant with each country.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.260]   Amazon has obtained approval from the EU Data Protection
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.140]   Authority's foreign agreement and model clauses, which
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.260]   allows it to continue to serve its European customers.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.220]   So it says, with our EU-approved data protection
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.940]   agreement and model clauses, AWS customers can continue to
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.020]   run their global operations using AWS in full compliance
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.420]   with EU law.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.220]   That's very--
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.300]   I'd say, hey, well, I'm cool.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.980]   I got AWS behind me.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.900]   I've said that to them.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.700]   And they said, we're cool at the AWS side, but we need to
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.900]   be cool.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.220]   Also managing our data.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.180]   Interesting.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.700]   I don't know.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.580]   It's complicated.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.780]   This is the whole problem with this entire fiasco, which is
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.900]   that instead of working toward an alternative for Safe
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.260]   Harvard, they simply threw a monkey wrench in it and
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.540]   everybody's confused.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.660]   Nobody, including Amazon, really knows what is going to
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.220]   happen here.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.580]   And Barry's a perfect example of what the real problem is.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.020]   Barry himself is willing to--
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.540]   has been around long enough to where he knows--
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:45.980]   I'll do it.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.900]   I think this is going to be fine.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   But he's got customers who are pushing back and saying, well,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.020]   we need assurances.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.820]   We need more than just your sunny optimism.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.900]   And there are none to be have.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.420]   There's no place where you can go and be assured that this
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.380]   is what's going to happen.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.220]   Nobody knows.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.820]   It's a really, really bogus situation that Europe has
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.020]   created here.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.540]   Let's take a break.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.580]   We got more to talk about.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.060]   Barry Schwartz is here from Search Engine Land of Search
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.420]   Engines.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.340]   What do you cover, Barry?
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.140]   I see your byline all the time.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.780]   Is there a particular beat you cover there?
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:31.820]   I cover most of the organic search stuff, SEO, Webmaster,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.780]   and local search.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.660]   And facts?
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.820]   Mostly geeky stuff.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.300]   In fact, you have a big article on SearchCap, right
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.020]   on the front page.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.300]   And Google has discontinued support for Ajax crawling.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   We just talked about that.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.900]   So this is right up your alley.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   Well, I'm glad you're with us.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.740]   It's nice to meet you.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.700]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.180]   Thank you.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.180]   Mike Elgin also here.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.820]   We just pull them across the room.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.500]   Yep.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.820]   I just-- I have a rolling chair, which is rolled across.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.420]   Pull that rope.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.140]   It's very convenient.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.500]   And so good to have you.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.940]   He's the new director here, of course, and runs Tech News
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.460]   tonight.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.700]   I'm sorry, Tech News today.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.060]   Yes.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.420]   Every Monday through Friday at 11--
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:17.300]   I'm sorry, 10 AM Pacific 1700 UTC on a Twit.T.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.540]   Where you will also occasionally find Barry as a guest.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   Yes.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.620]   I don't think there's anybody in the Tech News business
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.860]   who hasn't been a guest.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.700]   Oh, yes.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.420]   How many a day?
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.100]   How many editors a day do you have?
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.340]   Oh, it ranges from 1 to 5.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.900]   I've seen sometimes like a big number of people.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.220]   Yeah, we probably average--
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.900]   we probably average 15 a week.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.260]   Wow.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.340]   Like that, yeah.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.220]   And it's not all of them.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.020]   It's just the good ones.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.580]   We don't have the pickup artists.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.060]   We don't have the people who are lagging.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.940]   We have the bleeding edge, people like Barry, who
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.700]   are breaking news and finding things out.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.780]   And that's what you want.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.700]   You want to watch a new show with the authoritative sources,
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.420]   the reporters who are covering the story.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.980]   Is that what they call them?
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.300]   Pickup artists.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:58.700]   I like you.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.220]   Pickup artists.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.340]   Those are the blogs that just take somebody else's story.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.140]   Rewrite it.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.700]   Exactly.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.540]   Hate it when I follow a link and I see that.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   You know, and this is part of what we do on Tech News today
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.100]   is we know the difference between who broke the story
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.620]   and who didn't.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.900]   And we get the person who broke the story on the show
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.340]   to talk about how they broke it.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.540]   And there's always content you won't read in their articles.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.260]   I try to do that when we're talking about something.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.180]   Follow the link.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.380]   Because at some point, they'll always--
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.620]   I hope always credit the original source.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.580]   I like to follow the-- all the way down
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.780]   to the original source.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.580]   I showed it, I brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.820]   If you're in the unenviable position
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.900]   of having a higher people for your business,
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.700]   think of it this way.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.740]   What is a challenge is also a huge opportunity.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.180]   Those people make your business.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.460]   That's what a company is.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.180]   It's made up of the people who work there.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.660]   And your company can succeed or fail based on the hires
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.460]   you are going to make today.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.380]   That's why it's so important to go to the right places
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.300]   to find the right people.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.100]   And sometimes that means kissing a lot of toads
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.980]   to find that Prince of Princess.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.340]   ZipRecruiter, this is their new tagline.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.340]   I've just invented it.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.980]   Makes it easier to kiss a lot of toads.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   100 plus job boards with a single click of the mouse--
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.460]   I mean, including all the social networks like Twitter
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.700]   and Facebook and Craigslist, it'll give you access, not only
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.140]   to all the people on those job boards,
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.940]   but they have 6 million current resumes in their database.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.980]   So within a day of you posting, you
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.580]   will start getting lots of candidates.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.860]   Now, here's the best part.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   You're not going to get them calling your phone
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.660]   or sending you email direct.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:38.420]   They'll all filter into ZipRecruiter's trademark interface.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.380]   This interface is great because it gives you a chance
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.900]   to very quickly--
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.940]   and since you're going to get hundreds of applicants,
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.220]   very quickly screen them so you get rid of anybody
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.820]   who doesn't fit and rate them and then hire the right person.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.580]   In a day or two, you're going to have the best candidate
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.140]   for that job you've ever seen.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.740]   Because it's very easy to separate the wheat from the chaff,
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.140]   the toads from the princes, it's a great system.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.540]   No wonder more than 400,000 businesses,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.900]   including to it have used ZipRecruiter to hire.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.700]   You can do it too.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.180]   We got an email from Dan.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.260]   He was a very happy sentence and email.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.580]   This is the quote, "The hardest part about running a business
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.460]   when you need to hire is you have
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.680]   to spend extra time recruiting exactly when
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.580]   you're short staffed when you have the least time to spend.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.260]   But with ZipRecruiter, I've gotten quality candidates
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.740]   within 24 hours of posting a job.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.700]   ZipRecruiter's website makes this process so much faster
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.180]   by letting me manage candidates in one place.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.460]   That's the secret sauce here.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.140]   Not only do you reach out to more people and more places
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.020]   and more candidates, not only do you
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.500]   get more people and more candidates for that job,
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.780]   but you have an easy way to manage all those applicants.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.820]   And that's fantastic.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.620]   Find the right person fast.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.020]   Go to zipprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.780]   You'll get a four-day free trial.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.500]   That's enough really to hire that person you need today.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.740]   ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.860]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.620]   in Google.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.660]   Barry Schwartz from Search Engine Land.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.580]   Mike Elgin from Twit, myself.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.300]   We're talking about the week's Google News.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.900]   Jeff Jarvis is on assignment.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.940]   He's probably on a plane, actually.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.540]   This is a story from Search Engine Land,
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.460]   I found interesting.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.060]   More than half of Google's searches are on mobile now.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.420]   Half of Google's searches happen on mobile.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.940]   You knew it was going to happen.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.780]   Well, more than half of our visitors to our website
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.340]   are mobile.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.380]   I'm sure that's true of Search Engine Land, too.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.860]   But Search is a little different because--
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.460]   I don't know about how you use mobile,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.820]   but I don't go to the Google web page
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.060]   and type in a search on mobile.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.020]   Well, it's an interesting fact because, of course,
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.180]   a huge number of access of content
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.540]   on the web is through apps.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.980]   So there's apps over here.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.220]   And then there's people using browsers
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.100]   on their mobile devices over there.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:58.980]   And they're different.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.100]   And this is saying that, among all the browsers,
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.060]   desktop and mobile, now more than half are on mobile.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.700]   So the vast majority of internet usage is on mobile devices.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.180]   See, that's what that tells me.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.020]   Half of searches are on mobile.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.740]   That means like 90% of computing is on mobile, right?
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.260]   It has to be.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.300]   It has to be.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.620]   And people are using their-- yes.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.340]   And there's also an age differentiation on this.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.860]   The younger people are, the more likely they
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.780]   are to use their mobile device for everything.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.180]   And the geezers are the ones using desktop computing
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.300]   for everything.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.060]   And then there's this spectrum between the two.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.420]   But yes, people are still using--
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.060]   people are still opening browsers on the mobile devices.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.060]   And typing in that window.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.940]   Yeah, typing on searching for this.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.820]   God, it seems like such a pain in the butt.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.820]   It's on a mobile keyboard and all that.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.580]   What's interesting also, the stats come from ComScore,
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.740]   is that searches are not down on desktop.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.980]   The desktop searches continue to be strong.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.900]   It's just that they've--
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.020]   mobile has ramped up so much.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.660]   We've outsourced our brains to the internet.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.220]   And we just don't even have to know anything anymore.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.780]   I bet you a lot of the searches are OK Google or Hey, Siri.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.940]   I bet you that's-- I mean, typing is such a pain in the butt.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.020]   Do we know how many of these are voice driven?
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.740]   How many are typed in, probably not?
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.300]   No, they haven't shared much about what's voice driven,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.460]   what's not, if it's Google that one, TAP,
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.620]   and all these other things that drive search per se.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.820]   And they might not be direct searches,
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.420]   but we don't know if it's typed.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.820]   I assume it includes both typed searches on mobile,
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.540]   as well as voice searches.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.780]   And maybe also native searches searching for apps
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.380]   and searching content within apps using app indexing.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.420]   So it can be a lot.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.700]   Well, you make an interesting point.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.340]   Now on TAP is just starting to roll out with Marshmallow,
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.020]   with Android 6.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.260]   That's going to double the number.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.060]   As soon as that becomes widespread immediately,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.420]   because you'll be using-- it's pretty cool.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.940]   The only Marshmallow I've been able to use
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.700]   is Jason's Nexus 7, which he-- and he side loaded Marshmallow
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.100]   onto it.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.940]   And it's so cool you're on anything, any web page,
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.740]   and you just tap to select a word or an idea or whatever.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.500]   And you get these results.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.740]   I think you're going to see more mobile search because of that.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.060]   Google's not-- Google, those guys at Google are smart.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.420]   They figure that out, huh?
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.380]   Plus, more people are going to be using Siri and Google
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.260]   now and Cortana and Alexa.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.380]   And when they-- half the time when people
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.300]   are asking for arbitrary information,
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.060]   that's going through a search engine as well,
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.900]   whether it's Bing or Google, Google's Knowledge
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.100]   Base, whatever it is.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.740]   And I think that's another trend in that direction.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.100]   So it's really kind of a fascinating fact
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.500]   that people are doing this kind of behavior.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.660]   And it also raises the question of what's a mobile device.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.020]   So a smartphone mobile device?
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.420]   Is it tablets?
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.540]   A mobile device?
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.020]   You know, a seven-inch tablet.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.780]   Is that a mobile device?
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.420]   And I'm thinking it is.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.180]   Is a Microsoft Surface book a mobile device?
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.540]   No.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:58.980]   OK, but--
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.860]   It's a Surface Pro.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   But is an iPad--
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.500]   I say no.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.340]   Is an iPad Pro.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.140]   That's iOS.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.180]   Mark Zuckerberg famously said--
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.500]   Well, he said it's not.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.980]   But he would have to admit that it's a portable device.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.340]   So you carried around the house.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:10.860]   It was his idea.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.420]   Very true.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:11.940]   Do they?
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.860]   How do they break this down?
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.660]   ComScore must have a rule of stuff.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.300]   Yeah, so I don't know if they're breaking this figure down
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.820]   by tablet searches, but in terms of Google's definition
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.020]   of what's a tablet, what's not, it depends.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.940]   I would think on some cases, does the device have apps on it?
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.380]   And then those are mobile apps.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.700]   So maybe it's a mobile device.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.420]   But on the other end, when it comes
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.060]   to building a mobile-friendly website
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.780]   according to Google's Webmaster Guidelines,
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.300]   a desktop version of your site rendering on a tablet
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.260]   is perfectly fine.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.780]   There's no problem with that.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.900]   But a desktop version, whether or not
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   a mobile device, like a phone type of device,
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.740]   is not acceptable.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.500]   It's not mobile-friendly.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.900]   Is six inches the cutoff?
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.300]   What's the size cutoff?
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.540]   They didn't really specify what the cutoff is.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.700]   So I mean--
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.940]   Not clear.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.740]   So this is an X6.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.500]   That's six inches.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.780]   An X7 is one.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.580]   It's a little bit bigger.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.020]   Is that the cutoff right there?
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.220]   I mean, that's a weird place to put it.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.220]   Maybe if it gets phone calls or not, maybe that's the cutoff.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.900]   Maybe that's it.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.540]   OK.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.380]   But why would that matter for data?
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.380]   It's a muddled thing to define.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.060]   It's clear on the iOS platform.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.220]   You have iOS and you have OS 10.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.980]   One is a mobile and the other isn't.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.860]   That's one way to do it.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.380]   You go over to Google and it's less clear.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.260]   Of course, everything on Android could theoretically
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.620]   but now we have the Pixel C.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.860]   So is that like a desktop computer?
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:34.460]   I'm going to say anything that doesn't have an attached keyboard.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.260]   It's tough.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.900]   I'm going to say if there's not an attached keyboard,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.460]   that's mobile.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.620]   So a Surface Book would not be mobile.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.820]   So when I use a keyboard with my phone, what--
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.900]   But that's not attached.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.660]   I see.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.180]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.260]   So if it's super glued on there.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.220]   That's not attached.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.780]   It's just dumb.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.820]   You had an Arsenal article in Search Engine landing
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   which you talked about and I thought this might be telling.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.580]   Despite the growth in apps, Search remains strong.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.540]   Google Search in mobile browsers is big.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.020]   This comes from a Morgan Stanley report based on the com
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.020]   squared data.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.260]   But Google Search within the Google app is even bigger.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.420]   In fact, Google Search is the fourth most popular app
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.900]   overall in the US.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.940]   And that would include-- OK, Google, right?
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.180]   That would include voice search.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.940]   Because that goes through that app.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.980]   At least on iOS it goes through that app.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.300]   I don't know what it does on Android.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.500]   I guess it doesn't go through any apps.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.060]   And all of this--
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.220]   --force the most popular app.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.660]   And all of this raises another interesting question,
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:37.540]   which is the number one app by far is Facebook.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.340]   And Facebook is constructing an alternative
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.540]   to the entire internet.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.140]   They've recently come out with their own shopping sites
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.260]   so they're going after Amazon.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.260]   They've recently come out.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.820]   They've reinvented AOL is what they've done.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.900]   Exactly what they've done.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.700]   So you think of an alternative reality
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.700]   and an alternative internet.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.300]   And when you search on Facebook, good luck finding anything.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.340]   But eventually I think they'll have Search.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.940]   Is that a search?
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.380]   Funny because that whole knowledge graph or whatever
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.140]   they call it, the social search, that
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.780]   was a big deal when they released it.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.300]   Where is this?
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.100]   Anybody use it?
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:04.380]   I know.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.060]   I use it to search for a person's name.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.980]   Search for the content of something
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.380]   in a post on Facebook.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.220]   And you will find literally nothing.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:11.660]   Nothing.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.860]   It's bizarre that this doesn't bother anybody.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.900]   You can't search it.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.660]   You can't search it.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.780]   And again, they're taking over the world.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.820]   If you look at the number of users on Facebook, on Instagram,
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.980]   on WhatsApp, on everything that Facebook has
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.100]   on their own Messenger app, that's
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.100]   the vast majority of users online.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.060]   The top 25 mobile apps by unique visitors--
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.620]   this is from comm score, June 2015--
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.500]   plus year to year, year over year growth.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.980]   So Facebook is 125--
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.660]   I'm assuming this is million.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.500]   Maybe it's billion.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:49.860]   I don't know.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.700]   125 million, 727,000.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   But 9% year for year growth.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.860]   You know who's growing faster?
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.420]   Facebook Messenger, 144%.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.540]   But you could buy those two.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.660]   It's completely dominant.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:06.140]   YouTube's in the middle with 18% year over year growth.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.180]   Google Search is the fourth, as we mentioned, with 16%.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.380]   Then Google Play, Google Maps, Pandora, of all things.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.740]   Gmail, Instagram, also a Facebook property.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.700]   Apple Music, which is pretty big given
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.420]   that it's only on iOS.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.940]   Apple Maps.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.700]   Pinner's is growing.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.580]   Meanwhile, Twitter and Snapchat are laying people off.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.940]   Yeah, because--
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.140]   Snapchat's laying people off?
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.060]   Yeah, they stopped--
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.660]   Oh, man, I was bullish on Snapchat.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.580]   Well, Snapchat itself is doing pretty well.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.500]   But they launched into creating original content.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.860]   And this week, they decided they're
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.940]   getting out of the-- they're not going to create any of this.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.140]   So the people they're laying off are the people--
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.300]   The authorial staff.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:46.780]   Exactly.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.300]   Exactly.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.380]   But you know what?
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.700]   I think they're still a very strong platform.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.660]   But again, they're in a different universe,
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.620]   a different stratosphere than--
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.820]   that's a wrong term.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.780]   But they're in a whole different level than Facebook.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:03.620]   Facebook is the equivalent of many, many snapshots
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.700]   in terms of users, of course.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.140]   Should Facebook continue to attempt to acquire?
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.580]   Let's Snapchat.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.060]   You know what I think is interesting is now
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.500]   the executive chairman over at Twitter is--
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.380]   Omid.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.140]   You say his name.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.020]   I will and just--
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.220]   I've got to give you a second.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.940]   He's a Google employee.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.500]   A long time Google guy.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   Cordes Stani.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.900]   I think is how you pronounce Stani.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.620]   That's right.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:38.140]   He is actually a former-- oh, so he's not still at Google?
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.900]   No.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.340]   Oh, OK.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.420]   See, I was drawing a lot of conclusions from that.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.740]   Like, maybe this was the wedge, the camel's nose
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.380]   under the tent of Google taking over Twitter, which I still
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.340]   think would be a smart thing to do, wouldn't it?
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.340]   He was in plain number 11 at Google.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.060]   I think very well respected at Google.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.620]   He would be the guy.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:08.500]   He was the chief business officer from August 2014 to August--
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.180]   oh, till the company reorganized under Alphabet.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.900]   And he's now a senior advisor.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.020]   So you know what?
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:19.020]   He's in that special Google camp of we don't have a job for you,
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.620]   but please continue to accept this check.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   And if you think of anything good, let us know.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.300]   Big cat on the roof.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.660]   He is the mole.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.420]   He is the guy on the Twitter board now
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.500]   that begins the conversations of--
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.860]   I think this is a sign Google wants to acquire Twitter.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.140]   Google-- I mean, of course, I'm sure we've
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.340]   had this conversation many times.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.260]   But what benefit could Google bring to Twitter
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.940]   other than truckloads of cash?
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.740]   It's not what benefit Google could bring to Twitter.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.740]   It's what benefit Twitter could bring to Google.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.140]   It's all those social signals.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.260]   Don't you think, Barry, that helps a lot with search.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.300]   Is that one of the things that's missing at Google?
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.660]   That's why they created Google+.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.100]   Right.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.860]   So Google's talked about this a lot in terms of social signals.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.380]   That cuts us talked about it.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.740]   Since then, other Googlers have talked about it.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.340]   And Google's afraid to use Twitter signals
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.820]   because remember when they turned off the fire hose?
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.540]   But they've remade that deal?
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.340]   That deal was remade?
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.100]   They remade the deal.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.980]   But they don't want to use that for rank purposes.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.820]   Because they're afraid they're going to turn it off again,
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.260]   and they're ranking how they're going to break.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.620]   That's why you buy it.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.660]   You can't turn-- right?
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.140]   They own it.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.020]   They can't turn it off.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.500]   So we accept that Google wants those signals.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.820]   They really want those signals, right?
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:36.060]   They also say it's very, very easy to manipulate.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.020]   Although links are very easy to manipulate.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.980]   So plus, favoriting something, retweeting something,
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.460]   I don't know, paying a very high profile Twitter personality
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.820]   to tweet out a link and share stuff.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.060]   I don't know.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.540]   I'm maybe reading too much into this.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.700]   But the fact that this guy is now executive chairman at Twitter.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.900]   Just feels to me like Larry called him and said, look,
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.500]   we're not going to have anything for you after alphabet.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.300]   We would really like to--
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.140]   we've got to-- it feels like a John LeChere novel.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:12.940]   Right.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.820]   Mr. Smiley, you're on the beach.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.260]   Go ahead.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.300]   Enjoy your retirement.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.980]   And oh, by the way.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.500]   If you should have any free time, we've got a little job for you.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.940]   Now, Cortes Donnie, he's a really, really deep go guy.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.380]   He was employee number 11 in 1999.
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.540]   Came from-- he's been all over the place.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.380]   Came from--
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.740]   He's Iranian.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.940]   He moved to the US, I think, in '79 or so.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.180]   But he worked-- where did he work?
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.860]   He worked at a bunch of big companies.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.420]   He was at Netscape as a vice president.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.660]   He was at Hewlett Packard.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.660]   You know, that could be good or bad,
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.420]   depending on when he was at Hewlett Packard.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.220]   Chief business officer at Google,
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.460]   that's the guy who makes-- makes business deals, right?
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.660]   Isn't that the guy who would--
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.020]   He's the guy.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.580]   He probably fell in love with a guy
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.980]   when he was going over to make business deals from Google.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.980]   Hi, I'm from Google.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.500]   I want to talk about business deals.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.980]   Jack Dorsey says he tweeted--
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.300]   Of course, because--
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.860]   That's right.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.580]   Why would you have a press release
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.700]   or an interview or anything?
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.340]   He says, "A great chairperson is the first step toward continuing
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.860]   to make our board one of the best in the world
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.100]   and purpose-built to serve Twitter."
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.380]   By the way, the first thing he did, of course,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.740]   was get rid of Dick Costalo, the former CEO.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.060]   He still got to have Williams look breathing down his neck.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.340]   The other-- the other founder.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:31.740]   Right.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.100]   He's next.
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.220]   I bet you have's next.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.420]   "Omi is a proven and experienced leader
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.780]   who will directly help and coach me and our leadership
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.900]   and help us recruit the best folks to Twitter."
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.660]   Well, that's for sure.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.260]   Yep.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:45.660]   I see.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.300]   He left Google because he was set on how much money
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.100]   that Google spent on the abcd of g.com.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.540]   You've got to say the whole thing if you're going to say
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.860]   the ABCD, if you're a JK alum and a PQRSDU,
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.620]   VWXYZ.com.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.100]   And sometimes you've got to ask why.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.100]   Sometimes why.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.180]   So one of the interesting things about him
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.700]   is he grew up in Tehran, Iran, and he
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.260]   went to an Italian Catholic school in Iran,
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.460]   moved to San Jose at the age of 14 and graduated
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.300]   from San Jose State and worked at H.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:20.540]   And Netscape, where he was there kind of at the big growth
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.420]   spur of Netscape after their IPO.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.780]   He also-- before then, he worked at Go.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.860]   Remember Go-Corne?
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.300]   You've been around long enough to go.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.540]   Yes, I do remember going.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.940]   It was a pen-based operating system, right?
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.620]   Yeah, it was-- yes.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.540]   Or do they make hardware?
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.460]   I can't remember if they made hardware.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.100]   No, I think that was-- it was an operating.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.700]   It was going to be an alternative.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.260]   Now, one of the things about Cortistani
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.540]   that's a little surprising-- you think, oh, who's this guy?
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.900]   He's a former Google employee.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   He's probably upper middle class, lives in Palo Alto.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.820]   He's worth $2 billion.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.780]   The guy's a billion.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.580]   He's a billion.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.780]   But of course, the guy like that, the challenge posed
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.940]   by Twitter would be of an interest.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.180]   It's the same reason that Marissa Meyer would move to run Yahoo.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.740]   It's what a challenge, right?
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.340]   Exactly.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.220]   How's that working out for her?
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.580]   I don't know.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.620]   What do you think?
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.340]   We haven't talked about Marissa in ages.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.100]   What's going on over at Yahoo?
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.580]   Ever since Cara Swisher got acquired by Vox?
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.460]   Not a thing.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.660]   I just think that--
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.060]   I just think that if she looked back at where it would be
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.540]   today, like in hindsight, I probably
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.020]   think she probably would not have done that.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:29.380]   No.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.900]   Really?
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.020]   Like she'd be better off at Google?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:33.340]   When I--
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:33.860]   Maybe.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.860]   That's-- yeah, it was a hard company to turn around.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.980]   And I don't think if she looked at her progress
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.620]   as of today, next you would think,
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.260]   I turned the company around.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:41.780]   No.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.700]   Can't say that.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.860]   I think that what's interesting about it
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:50.340]   is not whether Marissa Meyer has failed
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.620]   or isn't great enough to turn Yahoo around.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.540]   I think what's interesting at this point
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.140]   is we have to confront the probability
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.260]   that Yahoo is unsalvageable, that it can't--
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.940]   first of all, nobody knows what it is.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.260]   Nobody knows what its function or purpose is.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.540]   Nobody is able to impose a purpose or function
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.660]   on this company after the fact.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.580]   I just think that it should be stripped for parts
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.740]   and sold off and just dismantled, and everybody
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.180]   should go home or something like that.
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.260]   I think that Marissa Meyer has done a perfectly good job,
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.980]   as good as anybody could do.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.740]   And it's just something that can't be done.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:31.100]   She didn't--
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.140]   It may be that it was a ship that couldn't be turned.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.620]   Or maybe she wasn't the captain to turn it.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.780]   Turn it where.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.500]   What is it?
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.820]   It was a portal.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.500]   And then in addition to that, they
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.260]   bought a gazillion little semi-related company.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.300]   It's a content play.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:48.780]   Yeah, so--
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.940]   She couldn't decide, though, could she, whether it should
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.220]   be a contact company or a services company.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.180]   She kind of bet on both.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.140]   People expected her to choose one or the other.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.180]   But again, once you choose one or the other,
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.460]   once you decide, oh, from now on, we're going to be--
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.340]   we're going to be tumbler.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.340]   That's our big play.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.620]   And everything else, we're going to get rid of it.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.660]   You're stripping it for parts.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.460]   And I think that's exactly what should happen.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.860]   And by the way, tumbler is awesome.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.380]   Tumbler is a great service that is doing OK.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:20.100]   But again, once you have it inside of the Yahoo umbrella,
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.540]   it's kind of a turd.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:22.900]   It's like--
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.900]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.820]   It could be Squarespace as a standalone.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.980]   Yes, yes.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.060]   Or WordPress.com.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.580]   Instead, it's a division of Yahoo.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.580]   I really think that they need to go in 50 different directions.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.980]   Or maybe become Alphabet and just have independently run
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.500]   companies.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.100]   She got a free pass for a while because they were living
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.940]   on the Baidu cache.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.460]   But then they spun that off.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.940]   And now the chickens come home.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.940]   Yeah, you're just shopping.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.620]   Did they take a mobile approach?
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.940]   I was like, we're doing mobile.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.860]   We're doing a regular writer.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.460]   A little bit.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.060]   Remember they updated the Flickr app?
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.820]   It was really nice.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.380]   That's all.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.980]   Again, she gets slick.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.780]   But remember, look at the Yahoo stock thing
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.860]   was in the top 10 of the most used apps for reasons
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.060]   I don't fully understand.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.100]   But there's no reason for a single company
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.380]   to own these different individual properties.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.260]   There's no reason.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.500]   I don't understand other than sell ads.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.700]   You have an ad network.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.740]   But so what?
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.180]   At the ad network itself should be a separate thing.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.140]   So I don't know.
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.380]   So here's one thing she's up to.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.940]   She and Mark Pinkis just invested in a startup
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.060]   that makes brain drugs.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.180]   They're going to need them.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.700]   Like what's that show?
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.620]   Limitless.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.420]   Have you seen this?
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.340]   Yeah, you take a pill and you suddenly--
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.860]   Yeah, it's a great show.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:37.780]   Yeah, it's a great show.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.260]   That's Flowers for Algernon.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:39.700]   Exactly.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:41.900]   And then you die.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.460]   The startup, which was founded--
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.420]   is called NOAA.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.860]   First of all, do not name your startup
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:54.540]   neutral box, N-double-o-t-r-o-b-o-x,
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.580]   if you want anybody to say it right.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.940]   Apparently, they make new tropics, which
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.100]   are cognitive performance supplements
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.180]   or smart or brain drugs--
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.940]   Way better than old tropics.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.980]   Like coffee without the jitters.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.820]   And I guess one of these guys had worked for Meyer.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.140]   She actually hired him at Google.
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.740]   So maybe it's just a personal thing.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.660]   She's apparently doing some angel investing.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.340]   They're going to make four supplements,
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.020]   a rise, sprint, yawn, and a new gummy coffee
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.140]   replacement called Go Cubes.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.900]   How could they fail?
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.980]   How could they fail?
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.620]   This is a guaranteed.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.060]   I'll have some yawn.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.180]   And you have any of those Go Cubes?
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.460]   yawn sounds like a--
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.620]   What do you want yawn for?
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.500]   Go to sleep, right?
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.260]   It's just so random.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:45.860]   It's just so random, maybe.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.140]   Simple clean packaging.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.900]   I shouldn't say and think, because maybe they'll be
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.020]   an advertiser next month.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:52.780]   And monthly subscriber auction is new trop box.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.460]   No, OK.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.180]   You're the clean packaging and monthly subscription option.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.700]   Well, remember, I don't know if you remember,
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.820]   when we first started before your time, Mike,
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.060]   we had this company called Brain Tonic.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.020]   Remember this?
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.500]   They came by and they said, we'll give you
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.820]   all the brain tonic you want as long as you just
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.620]   drink it on the air once in a while.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.540]   It was supposed to make you smart.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.580]   But it made me sleepy.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.980]   Did it make you sleepy, Jason?
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.380]   I don't remember it making me much of anything.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.980]   It tastes like grapefruit.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.020]   You know, sleeping more makes you smart.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.940]   I would drink-- now, probably shouldn't have had four or five
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.940]   cans, but I would drink it and then I would get loopy.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.020]   So definitely had a--
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.460]   Maybe it's doing something.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.380]   It's doing something.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.820]   So we'll see what yawn does.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.540]   Oh, man.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:45.700]   Jerry Kaplan, Robert Carr, Kevin Doran founded Go Corp in 1987
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.340]   to create portable computers, an operating system
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:53.220]   and software with a pen-based user interface.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.500]   Oh, mead Kordasthani, former senior VP of Global Business
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.980]   at Google began his startup career with Go Corporation.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:05.740]   Bill Campbell, who's chairman to it, also was there.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.940]   Randy Kommasar, who became CEO of LucasArts, was there.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:14.060]   And VP marketing, Mike Homer, who became VP marketing
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.940]   at Netscape.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.440]   And I guess that's really how I'll meet God over
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.180]   at Netscape during my IPO.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.300]   Yeah, the Penn Point OS, it ran--
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.780]   oh, remember this, on AT&T's EO Personal Communicator.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.460]   Yes, yes.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:28.940]   My god.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.020]   I think we have an EO in the basement.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.260]   I'm pretty sure we do.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.780]   I'm pretty sure we do.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.380]   That was going to be the future of something.
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.740]   It was the future of something.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:45.860]   The EO, AT&T pulled out.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.100]   Co-founder Jerry Kaplan says, in its lifetime,
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.900]   Go generated no meaningful sales.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.780]   And there it is.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.180]   Where did you find that?
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.220]   Just computers.net.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:05.220]   Yeah, it was a big-- so imagine a black and white sort
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.020]   of greenish device with a two-inch bezel.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.340]   And four inches thick with giant handles on the side.
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.980]   Out of years, I vividly remember this.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.060]   $2,000.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.380]   And it looks very much like a Newton, doesn't it?
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:19.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.260]   That's the Newton OS on there.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.500]   And look, there's your calendar.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.180]   Yeah, those are the days.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.220]   I still have it appiluted in the other room.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.700]   I have several in the other room.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.460]   I don't know why.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.300]   But you know what was bleeding edge about it?
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.460]   It was wireless.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.220]   Wireless.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.820]   This was an example of a great idea,
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.660]   of an idea whose time had not come.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.300]   Yes.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.140]   Because the technology wasn't there yet.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:44.620]   Right.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.380]   And that's all.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.500]   And if it weren't for these, probably--
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.860]   The Palm Pilot wouldn't have come here.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.020]   Yeah, we would have had the new-- we
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.060]   wouldn't have had the Palm Pilot.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.500]   We wouldn't have had the iPhone.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.060]   So it all kind of works its way up.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.300]   But I feel sorry for the people who bought the EO.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.580]   It's a collector's item now, though.
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.580]   Look at the--
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.660]   Has an antenna.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.180]   Giant.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:07.420]   It looks like a phone on there, too.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.180]   You could send a fax from the beach.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.540]   That's why AT&T was in it, of course.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.700]   The ears were put there by frog design.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.780]   They said this will differentiate it from everything else.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.380]   Because AT&T said no to the flippers.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.380]   They wanted to put them.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.260]   No flippers.
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.300]   We just bought ears.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.380]   $2,000.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:25.980]   It's incredible.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.140]   I probably bought one.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.180]   That's what's really sad.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:31.540]   I remember spending an enormous amount on mobile devices
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.700]   back in that era.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.100]   I think you, like me, believed that this was a future.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.100]   Right.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.820]   I bought an HP OmniBook for $3,000.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:40.820]   I had an OmniBook.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.620]   That was the one with the mouse was attached.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.620]   Well, that was you.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.620]   We got a button that we got boing.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.060]   And they had an arm that went back into the machine.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.300]   That was literally the best mobile device ever created.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.020]   So this was made by the calculator.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.180]   You're talking about the first one.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.660]   They ruined it by turning it into a regular laptop over time.
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.820]   But the first one had a little popsicle stick thing,
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:58.460]   the mouse control.
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.540]   But it ran on AA batteries.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.420]   Remember that?
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.300]   It had rechargeable batteries.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.100]   You could pop those out, put in AA batteries.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.580]   It had an incredible keyboard.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.420]   Again, it was from the calculator division.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.100]   So it was super high quality.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.460]   And it had 12-hour battery life in an era when two hours was normal.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.180]   Well, there you go.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.020]   There's that mouse with the arm.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.700]   I used to love that device.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.380]   And you would push it down and it would go into the laptop.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.780]   And then you'd close it.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.380]   That was a great--
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.260]   Not so great if you're a lefty, but otherwise.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.140]   Well, you can have re-education camps for people who are left handed.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.860]   That's not a problem.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.500]   I had one as well.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.780]   Yeah, really I'm in the book very well.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.500]   But even this version, which wasn't even in call--
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.300]   oh, and the other thing that was weird about it
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.740]   is it had Windows and Office in ROM.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.580]   Yeah, it was.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.620]   So it only had two megabytes of RAM.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.020]   Well, a lot of these, that's how they worked.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.780]   Because the applications executed in ROM.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.500]   They said, oh, we'll be updating these
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.340]   and just buy a new ROM.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:54.860]   It's the future.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.780]   And then they never did.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.300]   Wow.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.740]   Mike and I are old Fartsbury.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.740]   Just ignore us.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.580]   Old.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.260]   Someday we'll be sitting on the porch going,
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.540]   you remember the omnibook?
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.860]   Whatever happened to that Marissa?
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:09.740]   What was your name?
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.100]   Whatever happened to her?
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.060]   Oh, she got super smart and moved to Saturn.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.900]   So Yahoo stocks is bigger than Twitter.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.940]   And application use, it's grown 10%.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.700]   It is not in the top 10, but it's in the top 15,
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.860]   right under Apple Maps.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:39.500]   But the thing is that to compare Yahoo with Twitter is--
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.140]   I mean, you can compare Tumblr, which is one tiny bit
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.340]   of Yahoo with Twitter.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.860]   They should be a--
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.460]   I don't see Tumblr on this list at all.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.620]   I'm not sure they're considered a social network.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.420]   No, this is apps.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.900]   Those are just mobile apps.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.780]   No, not even sites.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.900]   These are the top 25 mobile apps.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.900]   Not even the top 25.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.780]   Yeah, I mean, it's-- yeah, mobile app.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.420]   I don't think people use Tumblr in the mobile app so much.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.780]   But Tumblr has a significant--
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.940]   That means--
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.460]   That means it's history if it doesn't--
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.540]   That's a good point.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.500]   That's a good point.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.780]   Snapchat's not very high.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.620]   It's just above Google+.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.460]   Are you still-- well, I'm going to save it for that.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.220]   Yeah, save it.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.900]   You still use that thing.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.900]   Our show today brought to you by-- where's my Harry's?
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.940]   Where's my razor?
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.900]   Give me a razor.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   Harry, it's not too late to show with that beard.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.140]   All you got to do is get a little Harry's
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.140]   and you'll get a little less Harry.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.500]   Harry, I don't think that's their slogan.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.940]   I'm good at making a bad slogan.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.860]   That's really one of my forties.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.460]   This is the Harry's razor.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.100]   So the idea is these guys said, we want to--
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.100]   this is what everybody now is.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.100]   If you're a hot young thing coming out of school
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.380]   and you want to do a startup, you say,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.220]   what is right for disruption?
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.220]   What industry begs to be reinvented on the internet?
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.900]   And of course, it doesn't take long.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.420]   You go to the grocery store and you look at the razor blades
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.060]   under lock and key.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.580]   And I think a light could go off.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580]   And you could say, you know what?
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:14.580]   These are so expensive that they lock them up.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.220]   In the drug store, surely you can make these for less.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.980]   So the guys at Harry's did a little research.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.860]   They had some experience.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.580]   Jeff, one of them was a-- started Warby Parker.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.700]   So they had a little experience.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.380]   And they had a little venture funding.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.180]   Actually, I think they went to the venture fundings
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.620]   and the funders and they said, look, I got an idea.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:35.540]   We can do a direct to you business
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.780]   in razors and razor blades.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.620]   But we've got-- there's one little catch.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.420]   We've got to buy the factory.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:41.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.100]   Where is the factory?
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.100]   It's in Germany.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:45.980]   Well, how much?
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.620]   It's a lot.
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.020]   But once we own it, we will own one of only two places
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.900]   in the world that can make these blades.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.300]   And we can make them to our specification,
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.500]   for precision, for quality.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.780]   And then, because we make them, we can sell them for less.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.460]   And that's exactly what Harry's does.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.300]   They engineer them for sharpness, for high performance.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.460]   They ship them for free to your door.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.740]   And because they make and ship their own blades,
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.380]   Harry's can charge you a lot less, like half as much,
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.700]   as that you'll let fusion locked up in the drug store.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.580]   Start with the kit.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.660]   Because you're going to need the handle.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.820]   Go to harries.com.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.580]   You can get the Truman, which is an amazing deal.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.700]   $15, although I'll tell you how you can save even more.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.340]   Or I have in my hands the Winston.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.460]   This is what I use at home, because I am an upscale kind of guy.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.300]   $25.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.900]   You get the rate-- in both cases, you get the handle.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.780]   This is the Winston is a nice metal handle, which you can
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.380]   get engraved and everything.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.180]   Plus three blades-- this is all for--
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.420]   well, as little as $10.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:53.060]   Plus three blades, plus you get the travel cover, which I know
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.740]   people laugh when I say, this is my favorite part.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:59.340]   But this way you don't cut your fingers when you're reaching
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.340]   in your shaving kit.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.380]   And then you choose from the Harry's shaving foam gel
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.100]   or the Harry's cream.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.340]   As little as $10 when you get the Truman kit and use our
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.100]   discount, that's an amazing deal.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.460]   Then sign up for the monthly resupply.
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.700]   Or buy monthly or quarterly, whatever it is you want.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.940]   You can get more shaving cream.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.620]   You can get more blades at a very, very good price ship
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.940]   directly to you for free no cost for the shipping.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.220]   They also have an aftershave moisturizer that protects
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.340]   and hydrates and smells fantastic.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.940]   This is actually a good place to go if you've got a dad
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:36.580]   or a grad or you want to gift somebody in your life.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.780]   This is a really welcome gift for men.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.060]   They even have this little stand, this cube that you can
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.380]   put your blade in and get engraved with dad's name.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:49.740]   I just feel like this is really half the price and the best
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.140]   quality, better than what you're getting in the store.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.340]   H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.060]   And here's the deal.

[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.020]   That means that Truman kit is $10.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.220]   You don't have to tell that that when you give it to them.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.820]   Harry's.com offer code TWIG.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.140]   Save five bucks off and let them know you heard about it
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.220]   on this week in Google, we thank them for their support.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:23.820]   And for keeping us smooth.
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:27.540]   So they took apart the on hub.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.940]   Did you buy an on hub when that--
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.860]   I did not.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.140]   I bought it and canceled it.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.420]   I got one.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.500]   Did you get one?
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.300]   Because I read Ron Amadio's review on ours, Technica.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.780]   And he said, this thing is not fast.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.220]   It's just a router.
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.260]   What do you think?
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.260]   It's not so special at all.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.540]   And I needed something special.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.740]   Yeah, I've a pretty tall house.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.140]   And it didn't--
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.140]   a big house.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.460]   And it didn't-- it doesn't reach the whole thing.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.700]   I was hoping that this would cover all the range of three
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.260]   zones.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:01.060]   Like, I think I'll get rid of two my zones and just keep one
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.340]   zone.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.540]   I have all-- now I have like four zones because of the hub.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.020]   It's worse than what you had.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.340]   I just read a really good article about Brian X Chen
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.340]   in the New York Times.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.820]   I think it was last Sunday.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.700]   He said, if your router is more than three years old,
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.900]   it's time to get a new router.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.500]   Yep.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.500]   And I had been using the Apple Airport Extreme, which I'm
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.340]   sorry, I had been recommending for years.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.620]   It was an expensive 180 buck router.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:24.620]   But I--
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.940]   That's why they call it the Extreme.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:26.540]   It was the price.
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.540]   It was a reference to the price.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.260]   I thought it was the best router out there.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.660]   But I was having all sorts of trouble.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.980]   It kept dropping.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.900]   And I went out and I bought it very nice.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.140]   It was much more expensive.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:36.900]   It was over 200 bucks.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.020]   Is that the one with the claws?
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.260]   It looks like a spider.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.940]   It got six antennas.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.380]   It's three bands.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.020]   The AC3200.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.860]   It's not that new one that they showed.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.820]   But at IFA, that's not--
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.740]   That's not-- oh, yeah, right?
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.580]   This is the top of the line is Seuss.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.900]   I got it because they use a version of DDWRT.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:56.180]   And the firmware, you can easily hack it.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.860]   In fact, I put Merlin on and immediately
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.980]   to turn off the bright lights on the front.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.500]   I just love it.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.540]   I mean, it's amazing.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.180]   In fact, I asked Lisa today, this morning,
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:04.980]   we've had it for a month.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   I said, how's the Wi-Fi been?
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.580]   Has it dropped?
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.620]   Nope.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.140]   Everything working.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:08.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.180]   She says, so much faster than what I thought
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:12.700]   was the premium router out there.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.700]   So I actually canceled the on hub because I saw Ron's review
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.980]   and I thought, no, I need something fast.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.460]   Turns out, Brian Whitman writing for Android Police--
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.340]   Another frequent tech news today.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:34.420]   And this is actually quoting the exploit tiers, exploit E.R.S.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.500]   They tore it down and rooted it.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.820]   And it turns out, the on hub is basically a Chromebook.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.700]   Disguise.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.540]   There's even a hidden switch, just like in the old Chromebooks,
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.020]   that lets you put it in developer mode.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.020]   Here's the thing that I'm confused about.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.940]   So OK, when this came out, when they were talking about it
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:57.940]   before the Rana-Madios of the world got their hands on this thing--
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.340]   They were pissed, by the way, about Rana-Madios review.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.340]   I'm sure they were.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.500]   But it was true.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.180]   But the spiel that they gave us
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.300]   was this is a new kind of router.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.700]   This is unlike anything.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.900]   This is for the internet of things, home automation,
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.580]   and all the rest.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.420]   OK, so that's Exhibit A. And then it comes out
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.100]   and it's a router.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:16.940]   And it's not that great.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.940]   Oh, they said it's got 13 antennas.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.620]   And it tunes the antenna.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.020]   Exactly.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.180]   And then they route-- oh, by the way, made by TPLink for Google.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.900]   TPLink's not a bad manufacturer.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.260]   In fact, in the wire cutter, they recommend,
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:32.380]   as their favorite router for under $100, the TPLink Archer C7.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.340]   So it's not that it's a bad company.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.940]   But I think Google's specs were very limited.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.580]   It turns out when they had to correct it-- well,
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.260]   it's 13 antennas and it tunes, but it doesn't tune all the time.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.580]   Yeah, things like that.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.180]   Right.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.500]   And so now we're learning that it's essentially a Chromebook.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.300]   It's Chrome OS device, Chromium OS device.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.980]   And so I have the feeling that Google is hatching a scheme
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.300]   here that we don't fully understand.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.380]   For example, it would make a lot of sense
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.380]   for a future Chromecast, for example,
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:08.460]   to be a home automation hub, right?
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.420]   Or to work with a home automation hub or something.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.540]   I think that-- what I'm saying is
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.020]   that I think that what's going to be interesting about the on hub
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.260]   is not in the on hub yet.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.100]   They're priming themselves here for a future
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.260]   where they're going to do something interesting.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.700]   So if that's not vague enough, then--
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.340]   Well, there was speculation it might be a home automation.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.220]   But that's what it was supposed to be.
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.660]   It has 6B in it, right?
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:38.700]   It has 802.11-- or 818 or whatever that is.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.700]   Barry, do you have any insight into this?
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.500]   Like, what do you think they're up to here?
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.500]   I have no direct insight, but I'm thinking maybe you could even
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.020]   like start talking to it, asking you queries, get certain queries
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:49.620]   back to you.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.500]   What's the weather, stuff like that?
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.300]   We thought that too, because it has a speaker.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   It looks like it.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.020]   It looks only used for once in the whole time you ever use it
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.540]   to do the pairing.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.260]   That's the reason I kept it, because I think the future,
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.980]   there's going to be major upgrades to it.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.980]   But put those.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:09.420]   And it absolutely should be an Amazon Echo type of device.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.820]   I mean, I'm just still so confused
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.940]   why Apple and Google aren't all over this category,
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.300]   why they're letting Amazon run away with it.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.860]   I think they, like many of us, didn't understand what the Echo
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.060]   meant until you use an Echo.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.460]   You just says, well, I could do that on my phone.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.380]   What do I need a black plastic tube in the middle
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.860]   of my kitchen for to do something that's really not even as good
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860]   as a Google house?
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:36.140]   I know for a fact that the Siri and the Google now that are
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.740]   both sitting on my phone are superior to Alexa.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.220]   And yet I use nothing but Alexa when I'm at home.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.380]   Love Alexa.
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.380]   And we're going to be buying--
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.900]   I figured out what it is, by the way.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.500]   Because you're talking to your house.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.540]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.060]   You're not talking to your phone.
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.500]   You're talking to your house, and your house responds.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.340]   You know, it's really weird.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.860]   Alexa.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.340]   By the way, we're watching a video of the rocketeers
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.900]   rooting this sucker, or whatever they're called.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.700]   This morning, my Alexa woke up, and I realized it's my ringtone.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.900]   My ringtone is the Twit theme.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.540]   And it says, this is Twit.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.300]   This is amazing.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.500]   Something like that.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.300]   It woke up the Echo.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.500]   Because all of a sudden, my Echo starts playing you.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.860]   I'm listening to the live stream of--
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.580]   What a great feature.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.020]   And I think my ringtone sets off the Echo.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.220]   OK, you just gave me an idea for a tip for the new screen
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:30.720]   savers.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.300]   I'm going to do a tip that says, create a ringtone that wakes
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.100]   up Alexa and asks for the weather.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:36.600]   Oh.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.140]   So your phone goes off, and then you get the weather from Alexa.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:39.660]   Oh, I like it.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.700]   It's dumb.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.820]   It's dumb, but it would work.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.220]   Maybe I'll come up with something better than that.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.420]   It's kind of annoying ringtone.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:47.940]   Me right.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.340]   It is interesting, because they're
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.100]   doing all this stuff at home automation.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.980]   And these protocols, I'm thinking maybe.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.860]   I mean, you walk into your car.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:56.780]   You got Android Auto.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.540]   You got--
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.820]   I want everything to--
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.300]   see, this is the appeal of the Echo.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.100]   I want everything to respond to me.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.540]   I want to be able to talk to wherever I am, whatever I'm doing.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.380]   And you're right.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.500]   The next thing would be in the car.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.340]   Talking the phone isn't quite the same thing,
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.260]   although Apple obviously is aware of this,
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.180]   because they turned on H.S.Lomo as the default.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.300]   It's always listening.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.300]   And you have to spend some time.
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.300]   I'm sorry, Sailor Lion and Dr. Mom.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.260]   They're annoyed, because we've woken up their Alexa.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.340]   I mean, they're Echo.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.420]   I call it the Echo.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.660]   I try to get out of that by calling it the Echo.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.220]   This does not look like something one would want to spend
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.460]   a lot of time doing, rooting your on hub router.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.420]   But Barry, you got one.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.380]   So if you get some free time--
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:42.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:46.220]   This weekend, I want to root it.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.340]   The funny thing is it's basically Chrome OS.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:49.980]   But why not?
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.340]   Why wouldn't you make it Chrome OS?
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.300]   Why would you reinvent the wheel?
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.300]   Especially with all their development on the home automation
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.140]   side around Chrome.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.100]   So maybe you'll be easier to plug that into your devices.
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   It does lend one to think that all of these conspiracy
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.100]   theories about future capabilities are real,
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:13.380]   because that's why you put a real OS in what is essentially
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.620]   an IoT device.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:21.940]   It's interesting that these guys at the exploitiers
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.540]   said, maybe we could do the same thing to this as we do
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.700]   to our Chromebooks to root it.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.220]   And it worked.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.860]   I mean, I'm thinking, OK, so just before we let
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:35.980]   this topic go away, imagine that Moore's law kicks in
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.580]   and further development and economies of scale
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.900]   and all the rest happen.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.380]   And the price of this comes down to well under $100.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.020]   So let's say it comes down to $79.99.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.300]   Or maybe they subsidize it.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.460]   And it's $59.99 or something.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.020]   It should be.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.180]   $49.99.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:53.540]   You know, it's no better than a $50 router, right, Barry?
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.780]   No, it's better than that.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.500]   It definitely has much better range.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:56.980]   OK.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.420]   But I'm saying in the future, let's
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.500]   say they really go for cost.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.260]   I mean, if you look at the cost of the Chromecast,
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.180]   it's so cheap.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.140]   And if they had something that was conspicuous-- maybe not
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.980]   as cheap as a Chromecast, but very inexpensive.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.620]   And they pitched it as an Amazon Echo type of thing
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:13.740]   where Google Now is available just to talk to your room.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.060]   And they would encourage you to have multiple--
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.300]   you need one in the bathroom, you need one in the bedrooms,
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:18.780]   you need one.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.100]   And then they would have a car version,
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.180]   or part of Android Auto.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:21.940]   I want it everywhere.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.460]   Put it everywhere.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.980]   But imagine that all of those devices are also routers
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.340]   that Auto switch and so on.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.420]   How much great connectivity you would have--
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.060]   Create a mesh.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.100]   --with your smartphone.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.540]   Plus, they would be like the Chromecast audio.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.020]   That would be speakers that would simultaneously link up
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.420]   and play music.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.500]   They have all the pieces.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.180]   They need to put it all together, right?
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.420]   And maybe Apple's going at this with the Apple TV.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.420]   Because you could talk to that.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.700]   Your TV is always there.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.420]   OK, Siri, on Apple TV.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.540]   A conspicuous lack of mention, though,
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.660]   in home automation features on the new Apple TV.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.420]   We all thought that's what it was.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:54.860]   Yep.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.980]   And maybe it still is.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.620]   But it's not apparent.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:01.340]   They didn't seem to think that that was important.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.180]   I'm not sure home automation is that important.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.340]   But I am sure that talking to your home is important.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.980]   And once you start talking, then you
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.140]   start expecting your home to be able to respond.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.060]   So you expect to say, please, open the garage bay door
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.500]   and it will open.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:18.740]   Somebody's at your door.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.420]   Speaking of awesome products.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.180]   Somebody's running your doorbell.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.540]   That's so funny.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.780]   He's got the ring.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.420]   So let's see here.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.780]   I think you teased before the ad that I was to launch
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.340]   another defensive Google+.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.060]   Are you?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:39.620]   Can you?
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.060]   Sure.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060]   Sure I can.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.140]   I'm going to make an argument for Google+.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.100]   It's a ghost town.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.300]   Well, that's what everybody says.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.220]   It's basically been shamed to the point where--
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.860]   Even Google stopped mentioning it.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.220]   Google is not supporting it the way they should.
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.980]   But let me just give you a couple of ideas
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.220]   to think about here.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.580]   So the two social networks that really people gravitate
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.740]   toward Facebook and Twitter have multiple problems.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.580]   Facebook is in its own universe.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.620]   You can't really compare it anymore to anything.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.620]   So Facebook is Facebook.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.780]   As everybody says, it's become a gated community.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.620]   They have a monopoly on everybody.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.260]   And so that's a separate thing.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.900]   So you look at Twitter, and there are two problems
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:24.780]   on Twitter that are actual social, political problems.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   One of them is the shaming ritual.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.660]   I grant you that.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:28.140]   Twitter is a--
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.180]   It's a pitchfork mob.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:33.780]   You know what the latest one that pissed me off?
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.100]   And I think without Twitter, maybe Facebook.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.700]   But I think without Twitter, this doesn't happen.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.700]   Meryl Streep is promoting her new movie, which you probably
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.860]   saw ads all over the Democratic.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.340]   Weirdly enough, the Democratic debate.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.300]   It's about British suffragette, the British movement
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.220]   to get the vote for women.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.020]   And she plays one of the leaders of that movement.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.740]   And they, in the junket where they do the interviews,
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.980]   everybody in the cast--
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.140]   they was for Vanity Fair.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.700]   No, no, it was her time out London, the time out magazine.
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.820]   They wore a t-shirt that said, I'd rather
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.260]   be a rebel than a slave, which is a quote from the character
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:13.340]   that Meryl Streep plays, saying, I
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.020]   know it's upsetting to people that women want the right to vote.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.740]   But I'd rather be a rebel than a slave.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.100]   And on Twitter, everybody started
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.780]   conflating that with a Confederacy and the Union
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.700]   and the Civil War.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.860]   And I'd rather--
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.780]   they said, is Meryl Streep saying she'd rather
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:32.500]   be a Confederate than a slaveholder than a slave?
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.660]   No, you nitwits.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.580]   But if it weren't for Twitter and the nitwit culture
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:38.260]   on Twitter, that would out have happened.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:38.820]   Exactly.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:39.780]   And there's a lot of that.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.980]   There's a post I did this morning on Google+,
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.380]   about there's a ritual that they have in the Chinese airline
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.340]   industry where, if you work a certain number of hours
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.740]   in your flight attendant, you have
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.500]   to get inside the overhead bin.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.020]   What?
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.460]   It's a gending ritual.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.220]   Well, they called it hazing.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.220]   But now there was so much Twitter outrage,
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.860]   or there's not Twitter, but the Weibo or whatever in China,
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.540]   that the industry's backtracking and they're banning it
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.260]   and stuff like that.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.900]   And this is an internal cultural thing.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.820]   Everything--
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:07.820]   It's nobody's business.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.180]   Everybody is forming these mobs.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:10.860]   And in--
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.260]   You know, in the chat, right?
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.580]   I think this is exactly right.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.140]   It says outrage is in vogue, PST.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.060]   Absolutely, yes.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:19.860]   And a tiny minority of people can make themselves
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.620]   feel super good by being better and holier than everybody else.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.020]   And they form this mob.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.300]   And then they get this huge number of people
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.180]   who are ignorant, frankly, who back that,
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.140]   just because they like the feel of the shaming that takes place.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.180]   And they feel powerful and like we're really changing things here.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.540]   It's just an ugly thing.
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.060]   There's that.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:42.180]   And then there's also the misogynistic silencing of women
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.260]   and minorities and homosexuals and others on Twitter
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.300]   that we've been talking about for a long, long time,
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:47.940]   the trolling.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.140]   Yeah, if you're not a sad white boy--
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:49.140]   --all that stuff--
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.100]   --by Twitter, you're just--
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:50.600]   Right.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:50.980]   --or out.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.740]   Everybody complains about that stuff,
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.140]   but nobody does anything about it.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.180]   The reason that stuff exists is that nobody leaves Twitter.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.340]   They just keep using it.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.620]   Wear us on Google+, get this.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.940]   People have arguments.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.220]   They have reasons, sometimes not reasons,
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.980]   but oftentimes it's a very critical place.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.140]   I'm getting a lot more spam on Google+,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.300]   than I did before.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.020]   Exactly, because what's happening
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.180]   is that Google's rolling this out internationally.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:16.820]   And so there's a lot of people in other countries, mostly,
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.620]   who are discovering that they can spam it.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:23.140]   But the tools for beating spam, for blocking people,
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.340]   are super great on Google+.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.700]   So I just keep knocking them down.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.060]   But again, Google+, is the only place
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.700]   that I'm aware of that has exactly what the world needs,
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.900]   besides love, sweet love, which is argument.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:40.140]   You can actually have a sustained, reasonable argument
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.140]   that is not ruined by a lynch mob, that's not ruined by trolls,
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.380]   that's not ruined by anybody.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.260]   It's like the well.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.260]   It's today's well.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.740]   And yes, it's a tiny minority of people who are using it,
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.900]   but they're better people.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.900]   I'm just going to say it.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.420]   The people on Google+, are better than the people on Twitter.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:57.500]   But what you get is a death spiral,
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.940]   whereas fewer people use it, then the people,
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.220]   like for instance, for some reason,
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.620]   I have four or five men's health magazine posts in my feed.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.140]   You have to just looking, because they're posting all the time,
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.540]   and everybody else is backed off.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.500]   You have to be active.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.340]   You have to block, you have to unfollow,
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.060]   you have to mute, you have to use the tools.
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.340]   And so it's an ongoing process.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:22.500]   In my case, I go in there, and I get two or three comments
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.180]   every day from people that I don't want
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.540]   to have anything to do with.
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.060]   So I block them and gone forever.
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:31.700]   And by doing that every day, I have a fantastic--
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:33.220]   How important is it to plus one?
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.660]   Do you do a lot of plusing?
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.620]   I don't see any value of it, then just to--
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.940]   I don't think it has any signal value.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.700]   I think it's just a way-- That's a mistake, right?
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.580]   I don't think it's a mistake.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.660]   I just think it's a way to sort of give an attaboy to somebody
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:45.980]   else.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:47.460]   What you need is Bradley Horowitz needs
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.900]   to start putting some effort into this, get some elbow grease.
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.660]   Well, I think it's been tainted by the Lynch mob on Twitter,
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.500]   ironically.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.540]   And this has been driven by the journalists
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.740]   who were obsessed with Twitter and who hate Google+
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.820]   for obvious reasons.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.780]   I mean, that obvious reason is that they
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.700]   love to be influential without any effort.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.020]   And that's what you can do on Twitter if you have a following.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.540]   On Google+, it's effort.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.020]   It's the work.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.900]   You have to argue every point.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.660]   And everything you say is challenged.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:18.420]   It's a very contentious place.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:19.700]   And it's not for lightweight.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:23.140]   And it's not for people who are too busy doing other things
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.740]   to really engage with the stuff they say.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.460]   So what people like to do is they like to write their articles.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.340]   They spend their time on that if they're a journalist.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:29.900]   Put it out there.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.020]   Put a link on Twitter.
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.660]   Have people retweet it.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.860]   And then they're done, basically.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.620]   Do you get, though, as a journalist?
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.340]   Because I know you cross post your computer world articles,
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.020]   for instance, on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Google+,
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.620]   do you get a lot of engagement and traffic, more importantly?
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.180]   Well, Google+, it's--
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.780]   I'm a bad person to ask because I have a huge--
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:53.380]   I'm going to get $5 million in like a couple of months.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.100]   You 10 times more than I have.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.460]   I get 3,000 additional followers per day.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.580]   Because you're the last post.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.340]   On Google+, exactly.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:03.340]   But so I'm not a good person to ask.
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.580]   But I get way more engagement.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.540]   So you do get engagement.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.020]   Far more engagement.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.660]   And it's great engagement.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.580]   I mean, I literally--
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:13.460]   it's such a luxury because I'm blocking people left and right.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.620]   I'm deleting comments.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.460]   And I make sure that every conversation on Google+,
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.780]   is just a great conversation with really smart people.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.220]   I should maybe spend more time here.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:25.380]   Well, you know, the funny thing is
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:30.500]   is that Google+ is not perfect, but look at how horrible Twitter
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.740]   is and look at how horrible Facebook is.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.940]   I mean, yeah, everybody's on Facebook.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.540]   But they don't want to talk about issues.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:37.340]   They don't want to argue.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.140]   They don't want to engage in--
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.660]   and Google+ is also great if you're into stuff.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.060]   Like, I'm super into making cheese.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:45.860]   I'm super into making bread.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.820]   And the bread community on Google+,
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.380]   the art of bread is amazing.
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.740]   Like, it's like the greatest resource for baking bread
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:54.700]   on the internet.
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.220]   And nobody cares.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   I joined that group because I like looking at pictures of bread.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.300]   Right.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.300]   The Twitter journalist mob doesn't care about rats.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   And it's just irrelevant.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:07.180]   But that's an example of one of 10,000 enthusiasms
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.820]   where you find all these great people.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.460]   So I don't really care if people are badmouthing Google+
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.100]   all the time.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:12.980]   And I don't really care that--
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:13.380]   No, no way.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.020]   That's good, right?
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.980]   Because that drives off the trivial people.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:17.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.140]   But also, on Google+, that's where all the Googlers are,
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.500]   for a show like this, to find the tidbits.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.420]   Well, you know what, Barry, I would disagree.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.420]   That used to be.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:29.740]   You don't get as many Googlers on Google+.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.940]   Which is part of the reason I think Google has lost interest.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   It used to be, of course.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.900]   You want to-- everybody I was following,
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.500]   half the people are following were Googlers.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.100]   I don't see a lot of posts from them anymore.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.940]   I think the reason Google has lost interest
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.460]   is because it was an internal political thing.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:45.980]   Google is behaving--
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.500]   It was Larry Page's thing.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.700]   Well, Google has become a little bit more like Microsoft
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.620]   as they've grown.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.740]   So Vic and Dautra made Google+, he
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.460]   was full of fire and passion for Google+.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.260]   Apparently, Pestred Larry Page for years.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:24:59.980]   Exactly.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.500]   Exactly.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.940]   And when he left, it was kind of like the Sundar Pichai
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.460]   era began.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:04.980]   It's gone.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:07.180]   And that was like, I have the feeling
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.820]   there was a huge battle between Sundar Pichai and Vic and Dautra.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.540]   And Vic and Dautra ended up leaving,
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.820]   and now it's Sundar Pichai's world.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.180]   And so Google+ is kind of like you
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.060]   don't want to speak the G word within Google.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.620]   So I'm just guessing.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.340]   I'm just guessing.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.140]   There are people who are very passionate about Google+
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.900]   and very knowledgeable about it.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:29.100]   But again, how much of the internet can you really handle?
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.700]   Google+, as it is now, is far more content
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.380]   that I could ever even get close to.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.260]   You know what I realized?
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.580]   And by the way, I would probably--
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.580]   Do you use it on desktop or on mobile?
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.020]   Both.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.660]   Mostly desktop but both.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:44.220]   What I find is that most of that stuff I use on mobile,
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.340]   and it's a diversionary tactic when I'm in line,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.580]   or I can't sleep, or whatever I reach for my phone.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.300]   And I find I will go to Facebook and Instagram.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.460]   I play chess online, so I'll play my chess game.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.540]   And less and less, I'm hitting that goo.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.380]   It's still on my front page, but I'm hitting it less and less.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.460]   It's not as accessible emotionally and psychologically.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.740]   I must Twitter or Facebook.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.620]   With Twitter and Facebook, you can get a quick hit.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.540]   What's happening?
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.940]   With Google+, you're like, OK, I've got to brace myself.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.020]   I'm going in.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.140]   And then you've got to go slog through and find the stuff.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.420]   So it could be improved, for instance.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.820]   This button that says, "New posts touch to see them."
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.540]   Is that the best way to do that?
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:20.900]   I don't--
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.900]   That's how Facebook does it.
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:24.900]   The way to think about Google+, which nobody does--
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.820]   I'm similar to Robert Scoll in the sense that I believe
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.420]   that I'm the only one who does it right.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.500]   But anyway, here's how you look at Google+
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.100]   as a social search engine.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:41.700]   So every circle that you have is a search.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:45.900]   So if you go in and you find the twit circle--
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.420]   I have a twit circle, which is everybody who works a twit.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.060]   I have that circle.
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.220]   And so I go in there and I'm like, OK, I'm just--
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:52.180]   I'm going to shift gears.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.660]   And I'm going to be engaging with Twit for a while.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.980]   And how many of us post there?
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.660]   Lots.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:58.140]   Lots.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:58.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.420]   Jason Howell's huge on Google+.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:00.940]   Are you--
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.060]   Jason still likes it.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.020]   That's good.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:05.620]   Actually, do you post your show stuff there?
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.500]   Yeah, we do our polls and--
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.980]   Yeah, about sourcing and stuff.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:09.940]   It's a great sort of--
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.180]   I mean, but I'm very dialed into Google+'s Android/Google
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.100]   side of things.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:15.340]   Right.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.660]   And there's a lot of people that are there
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:17.940]   that are passionate about that too.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.180]   So there's a lot of good conversation
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:19.860]   to be had around that.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.300]   All right, sure.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.460]   Talk to me into it again.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:26.420]   Every time you're on, Mike talks me back into using Google+.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.860]   I admit, Twitter sucks.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.860]   But--
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.460]   I notice you've got it running.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:30.820]   It's easy.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:31.700]   I have it running.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:32.660]   It's on all the time.
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.420]   Facebook, I always hate myself after I visit.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:41.500]   I like Twitter, but I'm fortunate that I haven't been
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:46.940]   the subject of a pitchfork wielding mob yet.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.260]   And so it's great for me.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.580]   It's not so great for the people who
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.300]   have been silenced by the trolls and by the haters.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.980]   Well, the only way I can use it is by just having a thick skin
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.940]   and using liberal use of the meat and blood.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.700]   Most people don't have the opportunity
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.860]   to develop such a thick skin.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.820]   It took you decades.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.780]   It took you decades.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.940]   To have skin thick enough to deal with Twitter.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.300]   And it's still maybe not quite thick enough.
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:08.180]   Very to use?
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.180]   Do you use Google+,?
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:10.540]   I do.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.100]   I use it a lot.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.020]   And I do it the same way.
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:13.900]   I have my circles.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.140]   I try to slice up my circles so that I
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.100]   can find certain content and engage in that
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.220]   and also cover that as a reporter.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.300]   I may need to do more circle management.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.060]   And so let me just give you one last pitch
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.420]   for why Google+ is great.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:33.100]   Google+, if you use it as a life streaming service--
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.260]   so what that means is that I pose this
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.340]   to my immediate family.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.060]   I post that to my extended family.
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.420]   I post this to public.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.820]   I post this to myself.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.940]   I post a lot of stuff just to myself.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.460]   And I'm the only recipient.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.700]   It's a secure way for me to remember everything.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.740]   And then later, when I want to remember something,
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.380]   I go in and I type my name.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.060]   And then I type the thing that I'm looking for.
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.740]   And it's exactly-- it's a great search engine, unlike Facebook,
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.180]   which has zero search.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:58.900]   It shows me exactly what I'm looking for.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:28:59.980]   And then, of course, Google photos
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:00.900]   has plugged into it as well.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.940]   So I can find all the photos.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.780]   So for example, my son right now is in Barcelona.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.140]   And I've lived in Barcelona.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.260]   And he was asking me for restaurant recommendations.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.980]   I went straight to Google+.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.180]   I typed in Mike Elgin, Barcelona.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.060]   I got most of the posts that were public.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.420]   I also got some more in the private.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:19.340]   But every single post where I mentioned the B word,
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:22.020]   Barcelona, I saw a lead right out in front of me.
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.060]   It's a little life blog.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.140]   It's a life stream is what it is.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.380]   And it's brilliant for that.
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.980]   Nobody uses it for that, but it's brilliant for that.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:29.340]   You know what?
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.780]   I would use it for that if I could capture those
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:35.660]   into my blog for preserving them.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.060]   And this is what you did.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:39.660]   You stopped blogging and you made Google+ your blog.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.100]   Exactly.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.220]   And if they would just for crying out loud,
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:46.420]   give us an API that had more than just reading,
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.900]   then I might consider--
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.340]   I need to save it.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.180]   I don't like putting all my content in a temporary basket.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.860]   So I would do that as long as I could get into my blog.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.060]   But I can't do that right now.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.660]   I think maybe I should look and see.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.020]   The other thing to keep in mind is--
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:01.420]   API.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:04.100]   Google+ is very secure.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:07.340]   It's the best my knowledge has never been hacked.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.340]   Twitter's hacked.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.100]   It's good at this.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.500]   And so this is the thing that's so great about it.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.940]   If you really pour yourself into it,
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.900]   you get a lot of-- the other thing that Google+ really
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.780]   needs is a Twitter view.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.580]   So I autopo--
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.540]   It needs to be less of a silo and more
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.220]   a participant in this.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:24.860]   Exactly.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:26.820]   And that's where an API would help.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.100]   So we've just solved this.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.140]   It's simple.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.980]   All you got to do is make an API.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.460]   So if you get to work on that, we'd appreciate it.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.540]   Barry.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:40.820]   Barry.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.580]   Barry, you get to work on it.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:48.780]   No, I think it's going to have to be that Brad fella.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.700]   But do you think Brad's paying any attention to this anymore?
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.220]   He's really been focusing on Google Photos, I know.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.580]   I know that he still believes in it.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.940]   But again, once again, I think the problem
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:03.140]   is just the-- and I think it's so ironic that I literally
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:07.740]   think that the Twitter hate campaign machinery has bad mouth
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.940]   Google+ into a reputation where it's not easy for anybody
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:14.660]   to be super enthusiastic about it.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.180]   And so I would say--
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.060]   I would say you are still.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:21.220]   I mean, as a writer and a broadcaster,
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.940]   I kind of feel like I need it.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.420]   I need the crowdsourcing.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.060]   But what you probably don't want--
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:29.620]   and Bradley, I have to reframe this-- is somebody posting
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:31.500]   their Twitter feed into Google+?
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.740]   That would just trash it.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:33.660]   Although you could block them.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.740]   That's the nice thing with Google+.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.420]   It's very easy to get people out of your streams.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:36.900]   It is.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.860]   And they're gone forever.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.820]   And it's just great.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.620]   Worth great.
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.420]   All right.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:44.660]   So you still use it, Barry, as part of your--
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.500]   is for you as a professional too?
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.940]   I don't use it for family at all or for friends.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:55.340]   It's all about me discovering content around topics
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.900]   that I cover as a journalist.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.860]   You know what's ironic?
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.940]   As we were talking about this, and I'm going through my Google+
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.140]   feed, I found two stories that I want to talk about.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.060]   Just a bit.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.700]   We're going to do that.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:10.780]   But first, a word from Blue Apron I love cooking.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.700]   But I rarely have the time after work.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.300]   I'm exhausted to go to the grocery store.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:15.420]   That's very European, isn't it?
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.820]   You have a little string bag.
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:17.980]   And on the way home from work--
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:18.580]   Give the bag out.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.140]   You get a bag out.
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.260]   You get a tomato.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.580]   You get a chicken.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.620]   You bring home your ingredients.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.180]   Blue Apron solves this problem.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:27.460]   It's a problem in our modern hectic world.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.980]   By delivering those ingredients to your door,
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:34.260]   fresh, straight out of the garden, never frozen,
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.540]   even the meats and the fish.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.740]   They're all refrigerated in this box,
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.540]   ready for you to cook that night.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.460]   And they come with these beautiful 8 and 1/2 by 11
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:46.100]   recipe cards with glossy images, coated stocks
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:47.580]   so you can save them later.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.340]   I wish-- you know what?
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:50.060]   A little tip, Blue Apron.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.060]   Whole punch those.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.780]   And give me a Blue Apron binder, because I
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:54.380]   want to save all those recipes.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:55.420]   You don't need that.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:55.780]   You know why?
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.780]   Because their app has 100% of those recipes.
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.420]   Oh, that's right.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.140]   They're all online.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.020]   In fact, videos are online, too.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.300]   So if you don't know how to dice an onion or some technique
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.020]   they're talking about-- and by the way, you really learn.
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.220]   There's a lot-- I cook stuff.
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:10.980]   And even ingredients I've never heard of--
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.060]   I found a new bok choy in one of the recipes
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.340]   that is my new thing.
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.140]   And I love it.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.100]   So you're going to learn a lot about ingredients,
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.860]   about cooking, about recipes.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.340]   And you will gain confidence.
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:27.020]   And you'll make these incredible meals for less than $10 a meal.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.260]   There are two different plans.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.540]   There's the date night plan.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:34.140]   You and another person-- it's really, really a romantic way
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:37.340]   to win somebody's heart, by the way,
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.780]   is to make a beautiful Blue Apron.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.860]   Sit out the candles, the tablecloth.
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.540]   They're going to love--
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.620]   They're going to think you're a master chef.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:44.260]   It's incredible.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.060]   They also have a family plan with kid-friendly ingredients.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.300]   The menus never repeat.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.740]   You can always tell them what you do and don't want.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:53.820]   They have vegetarian menu plans, for instance.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.140]   It is just so great.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:58.100]   How about one-shot-shot shrimp per loo?
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.780]   Now, I didn't even know what per loo was until I got
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:02.860]   the recipe for one-shot-shot shrimp per loo.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.100]   Or seared chicken and autumn vegetables
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.500]   with apple cider mustard joo.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:08.740]   There's the shrimp per loo.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.940]   It's a rice dish, big in the kind of Cajun gutter.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.980]   It's incredible, by the way.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.260]   And every bit of the ingredients you need for it
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:17.780]   comes in your Blue Apron box.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:19.580]   And exactly how much you need.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.020]   So there's no waste.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.020]   You need two scallions.
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:23.180]   They give you two scallions.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:26.100]   Not three, not one, two scallions.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:28.660]   Whatever you need, two ribs of celery.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.260]   I mean, it's everything you need.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.020]   Nevermore, you do a little chopping, a little searing,
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.340]   a little sauteing, and boom, you get the best meal
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.260]   you ever had.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:38.620]   And now you can cook it again, by the way.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.580]   Blueapron.com.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.980]   We got your first two meals free.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.860]   If you go to Blueapron.com/twit.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.740]   I hate doing these ads because my mouth
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:46.740]   wears every time.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:47.380]   I'm not craving blueapron.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.780]   I cannot.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:53.060]   The thing I love most about this is that they
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:55.260]   send you the ingredients that there's
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.900]   no way you're going to find that ingredient in the store.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.100]   You'd have to go to San Francisco
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.100]   and find one little--
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.100]   Like the Asian market.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:02.600]   Exactly.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.620]   And they just give it to you.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:06.020]   And you're like, wow, I've never even heard of this.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:06.860]   Love them.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.060]   You'll love them too.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.460]   First two meals free.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.220]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.260]   We thank them so much for their support of our podcasts
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:17.380]   and especially this week in Google.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:20.700]   So two stories I found in Google+,
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:24.020]   the power of Google+, the breakthrough candidate
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.700]   in the Democratic debate last night.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:30.420]   Well, if you go by Google, it was Bernie Sanders.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.260]   This is the graph of Google search interest.
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.300]   Maybe it's because he said things people went, what?
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.100]   And they searched it.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.260]   I don't know.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.500]   My theory is-- and I know we don't
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.260]   like to talk about politics.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:45.300]   But Bernie Sanders is a problem for the Democratic Party
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.140]   in the same way that Donald Trump is a problem--
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.020]   He's unelectable because he's a socialist.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:51.900]   They don't want them to be more--
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:55.100]   Hillary is the Democratic Party's candidate in general.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.100]   And Bernie Sanders is not.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   But he says the kinds of things that are real crowd
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:01.580]   pleasers.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.380]   And I think that an objective analysis like this
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.780]   would show that Bernie Sanders won the debate.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.340]   But--
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.620]   Not in the media.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.540]   You go to the media and it's like, oh, clearly,
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.540]   Hillary Clinton, you know, knocked on the door.
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.500]   I think what that shows is that the machine--
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.340]   It's why a third party candidate has such a hard time
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:16.860]   in America.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:17.860]   That's right.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:20.740]   The machine is so powerful that even in media coverage
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.580]   somehow--
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:25.780]   Well, the machine candidate always is the winner.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:26.780]   Exactly.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.860]   And this is part of the problem with our system.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.380]   And I think that the tech angle in all this, of course,
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:34.420]   is that Lawrence Lessig, who is running--
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.420]   I wish he'd get more attention.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.260]   Well, he's running on a single platform,
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.740]   which is to reform the corrupt system we have for elections.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.980]   And he wasn't in the debate.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.380]   Why?
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.780]   Because he hasn't reformed the system yet.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:47.660]   The very thing that he wanted to fix
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:50.660]   kept him out of the debates, keeping him out of the race,
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:53.580]   and will prevent him from having a chance of being elected.
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:54.980]   And I think that's really interesting.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.300]   And it's a tech angle, of course, because he's
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.020]   been involved very heavily in all of the technology.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.260]   Well, Larry's been a regular guest on Twitter.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.020]   We interviewed him.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.420]   He was our first triangulation episode.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:06.220]   And he was-- for a long time, his goal
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.340]   was to eliminate DRM and to fix the music industry.
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:10.940]   And then he realized, well, you can't do that
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.700]   until you fix politics.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.460]   And then he realized, you can't fix politics
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:17.180]   until you fix campaign contributions
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:19.540]   and the influence of money in politics.
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:22.500]   And then he realized, you can't fix that outside,
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.980]   because of course, the incumbents are the beneficiaries.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:29.580]   So they're going to always vote to increase and continue
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.780]   this influence of money in politics.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.300]   Of course they are.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.100]   The only way to get rid of it is to become an incumbent,
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:35.940]   get rid of it.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:37.340]   And he says, he will do that.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:40.860]   And then he will pick a really good vice president.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.140]   And he'll resign the day after he fixes the money issue.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.740]   He says, I don't want to be president.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:48.060]   I just want to-- you have to be an incumbent to fix this.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:48.900]   And it'll never happen.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.180]   There is one bit of hope, though.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.300]   And I think that there's an internet or a social media
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:58.820]   driver behind this, which is that the Bernie Sanders of the world
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:01.740]   and the Donald Trumps of the world, for whatever--
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.580]   regardless, forget their politics for a second,
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:06.460]   forget their perspectives on anything for a second.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.020]   The thing that people are responding to, I believe,
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.300]   above all, is the fact that they're unscripted.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:16.100]   They're not the product of a gaggle of handlers
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:18.860]   who are telling them exactly what to say and how to say it,
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.220]   because we know that this wins and that so on,
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.980]   this will get you through the whole process.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.060]   They're basically speaking off the cuff.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.180]   They're speaking in plain language.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.220]   And people are responding to this.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.300]   And I think it's because it has something
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.180]   to do with social media.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.900]   And so that is a bit of hope there.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.900]   That the people seem to be--
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:38.660]   Social media will be the democratizing influence on this.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.820]   And I think that that's why you see this, like in this article,
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:44.820]   all of this traffic around Bernie Sanders, which you wouldn't
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.980]   see if you just read the mainstream media,
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.660]   that there was apparently a lot of interest.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.780]   Either that or you said a lot of things people had to Google.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:52.060]   It's possible.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.340]   That's why I'm with you.
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:56.020]   I think that Curtis Drew--
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:56.500]   Drew Curtis--
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.860]   The Curtis of FARC should run for president.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.500]   He's running for Governor Kentucky.
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.900]   And maybe he'll win.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.580]   If he does, I think that's the next step.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.100]   White House.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:04.580]   Yes.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:05.180]   I'll vote for him.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.700]   You can count on us.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.420]   The two of us.
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:13.980]   We can't vote for you now, Drew, without voter fraud, but soon.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:16.220]   But you also interviewed him, by the way, at triangulation.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:19.100]   I'm really-- I'm a good at interviewing candidates
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:19.940]   who I don't have a chance in.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:21.460]   Hell.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.780]   My mother was a journalist.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:25.340]   And she interviewed Ronald Reagan when he didn't have a chance.
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.180]   And we went on--
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.340]   I was surprised to everybody, didn't he?
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.660]   So this is the other story I got from Google Plus.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:31.860]   I ain't got to do Google Plus more.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.580]   You convinced me.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.260]   That's great.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:36.940]   We've leaked screenshots showing-- we'd heard rumors for a while
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:42.180]   that Facebook was going to do a new breaking news notification
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.900]   app called Notify.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.220]   Well, I guess they're getting close,
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.580]   because this was reported by Business Insider and others
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.300]   back in August.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.740]   Here's some screenshots.
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.860]   So Facebook already has realized the strategy.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.060]   And it was very effective, as you could see earlier,
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.180]   when we talked about Messenger and how much Messenger growth
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.500]   is shown, by splitting out stuff out
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.260]   of the main big blue Facebook app, a Notify app
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:13.900]   that would let you know, for instance, when
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.580]   Vivo has a new music video, or when there's
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:20.420]   new daily freebies and deals, or when Buzzfeed posts
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.860]   its most--
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:23.900]   the trending stories.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.820]   What's interesting about Notify, I think,
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.660]   is that it's kind of like what they were sort of trying
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.660]   to achieve with Facebook Home.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.860]   I remember that when they wanted an Android user interface
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.580]   that went on top was your essentially your--
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.340]   A lock screen.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:38.860]   A lock screen.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:39.500]   It was a flop.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.660]   But they want to be the first thing you see.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.580]   They want the phone to be a Facebook phone.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.100]   They want the phone-- they want to be what you see when
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.780]   you turn on your device.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.420]   And this would give them that, because it grabs the notification
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:51.860]   screen.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:53.860]   It says, you said, they want to take over everything.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:55.220]   They want it on at all.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:56.220]   Yep.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.220]   And we finally know what the dislike button is, which
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.820]   is not a dislike button.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.060]   I wish they were testing this.
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:08.660]   Have you seen this button in action, Barry, the new Facebook?
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.780]   No, I haven't got to do it at all.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:15.100]   You have to be in Europe somewhere, I think.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.260]   So we only have screenshots.
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:20.380]   They're testing it right now, and I can't remember where.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.420]   But the idea-- and what do you think of this?
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.780]   Spain and Ireland only.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.660]   But the idea is, instead of just a thumbs up,
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.620]   you'll hit the thumbs up, press it hard,
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.540]   and you'll get these choices--
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:35.820]   a heart for love, a ha-ha smiley face, a yay face,
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.740]   a wow face, a sad face, which I think they did need.
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:43.420]   Because I hate liking the news when somebody's died.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:46.140]   And an angry face.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.260]   But I've seen so many people say they hate this idea.
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:50.580]   What do you think, Barry?
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.060]   Honestly, I hate Facebook.
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.380]   You're the wrong guy.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:56.380]   I'm the wrong guy for this.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.340]   How about this week in Google?
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:01.380]   Would it make you hate Facebook less?
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.820]   No, this makes me hate Facebook more.
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.220]   It would be an angry face.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.820]   This is why-- if they can have emoji,
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.500]   we need the poo emoji so we can talk about Facebook.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.700]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.380]   All right.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.380]   I mean, I think it's--
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.660]   I think if I can summarize why people object to this,
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:26.940]   the like function and the thumbs up imagery
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.900]   is iconic for Facebook.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.260]   It's what Facebook-- it's so closely associated with Facebook.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:35.380]   To have all these other alternatives that are non-iconic
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:38.500]   feels like it's kind of like when Twitter says they're
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.940]   going to have algorithmically sorted feeds.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.820]   It's like, well, that's not really what we signed up for.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.140]   So I think that's an element.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.220]   But it's practical.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:48.660]   Like you said, somebody says, oh, this great person died.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:49.260]   Do you like it?
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.380]   Because the person was great.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.380]   So what do you do?
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:53.900]   You need an action to take there.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.820]   You need a neutral reaction.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.020]   Like, wow.
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.420]   That wow could be positive, negative, doesn't matter.
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:03.180]   But it's a way for you to interact without saying, yeah,
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.100]   like this.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:09.620]   Because content is too nuanced for just like or nothing.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:14.900]   So I think it's a necessity for them to a certain extent.
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.500]   But people don't like it because it sort of doesn't
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:18.580]   seem Facebook-y.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:22.420]   Well, now apparently, there's another one.
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:27.180]   If you put something on Facebook, presumably it
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.740]   was part of your day and your year.
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:33.180]   Facebook, of course, as you know, has an on this day feature
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.820]   and a year in review feature, which
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:39.140]   will show you pictures from this day in previous years
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.300]   or your entire year.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.580]   But apparently, sometimes those memories aren't welcome.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:49.420]   And the social network has now given you a filter.
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:51.900]   I haven't been able to find this, but I have to find my on this day
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:56.180]   preferences that will let you filter out bad memories.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:59.700]   Yeah, because right now it's like, oh, remember on this day,
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.660]   three years ago, when you lost your arm
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.660]   in that horrible industrial accident?
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.380]   Well, we want to remind you about that.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.660]   Why did you post it on Facebook if you didn't want to remember it?
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.620]   Because I still had the other arm.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.540]   So this is a good--
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:16.660]   I guess it's a good thing.
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:17.500]   I feel like--
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.300]   Well, when you have the choice, if you put it on Facebook,
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.620]   I think it feels like it should be fair game for your year
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.460]   in review.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.940]   I mean, the fact is that most users aren't
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.460]   going to touch any of these features,
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.780]   but it's now your fault.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.900]   It's now-- if you get something in your feed
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.860]   that you don't like, it's no longer Facebook's fault.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.060]   Whose fault is this?
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:40.900]   Playboy is no longer going to put nudes in its magazine.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:42.260]   It's the internet's fault.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:42.860]   It's a porn--
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:43.820]   It's Facebook's fault.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.780]   I heard somebody believe Facebook.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.540]   What the hell?
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.900]   So apparently, Facebook--
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:53.340]   Playboy itself says the online porn is why.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:57.100]   You don't need-- it's easy to find naked pictures.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:58.860]   So you don't need that for Playboy.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:02.340]   So for those of you who say, I read Playboy for the articles,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:03.740]   well, guess what?
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.300]   It's true now, no matter what.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:11.300]   Starting in March of 2016, I think
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.700]   the Playboy is the Yahoo of--
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.340]   It's kind of an antagonistic, isn't it?
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.260]   Yeah, they don't really have a reason to exist anymore.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.340]   And I just-- I don't know.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.620]   This will give them a little bump of publicity
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.220]   where here we are talking about them.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.860]   But they're pretty much done as a relevant--
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.060]   Very strange.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:31.300]   Very, very strange.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:33.740]   What else?
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:38.020]   If there anything else I haven't talked about, Andy Rubens--
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:40.860]   remember Andy Rubens was the guy who ran Android.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:42.060]   In fact, invented Android.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.740]   Sold it, his company, to Google,
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:46.180]   and ran it for a while at Google left.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:49.540]   He has an incubator called Playground.
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:53.900]   And they just closed a round of $300 million in funding.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:58.060]   That means there are a bunch of rich people who gave Andy
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:58.740]   Ruben--
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.700]   Another rich person?
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.740]   Another rich person-- $300 million
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.100]   to invest for them.
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.500]   Because they figure, well, if anybody's
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.980]   going to do a good job investing my money,
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.540]   it'll be Andy Ruben.
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:11.780]   Everybody wants to be a venture capitalist
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.700]   and throw the money around and be the kingmaker.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.620]   But I don't understand how you walk away
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.420]   from what he walked away from.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.540]   They basically said, Andy--
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.660]   I'm not sure how they did this.
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.260]   We're going to put you in charge of--
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:23.540]   we're going to buy eight robotics companies,
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:24.900]   and you can be charged the whole thing.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:26.380]   You get the Atlas robot.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.580]   You get the big dog robot.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:31.020]   You can play with all that stuff,
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.860]   and you can create this and do it.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.700]   And he's like, you know, that sounds interesting,
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:36.700]   but now I'm going to go be a VC.
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:40.380]   I just-- that was the coolest-- he had the coolest job
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.580]   in the Valley.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:43.180]   He was in charge of all the robots.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.740]   It was so cool.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.780]   And he walked away from that.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.220]   Or maybe he was pushed out who knows.
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.220]   But--
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.700]   [SIGHS]
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.900]   And you know, Calicanis was on the new screen
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:52.860]   save was a few weeks ago.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:54.260]   Jason Calicanis, you know him.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:54.620]   Yes.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.820]   Made a lot of money selling.
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:57.820]   He was a blog entrepreneur.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:00.700]   Created, among other things, in gadget,
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:04.700]   and sold it all to AOL for something like $113 million.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:05.500]   He did well for himself.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.300]   Did well.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.780]   He's quite a character, and he's been investing
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:11.220]   as an angel investor ever since, and doing well.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:13.020]   He told me, I should become an angel investor.
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:14.300]   You should become an angel investor.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.620]   He said, the best angel investors are-- the whole key
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:18.220]   in investing.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.980]   He said, first of all, it's well understood
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.500]   the mathematics of the game.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.820]   80% will fail.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.460]   20% will succeed.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.500]   You figure out which 20% are going
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.980]   to succeed of your investments.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.260]   You kill the others, and you double down on the 20.
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:37.180]   It's kind of like if you've got a good hand in 21 in Blackjack.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:40.940]   You split your kings, then you double down on those.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.620]   He says, it's very algorithmic.
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:46.460]   He says, the key is access--
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:47.660]   is information flow.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:49.340]   The key is access to the startups.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.740]   And he said, this is why all Malek became a VC.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.740]   This is why so many tech journalists have become VCs,
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.860]   because they have the best access to deals.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:01.540]   They know what's going on in the Valley.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.460]   So we're wasting our time here.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.180]   If I wasn't going to be wasting my time,
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.140]   I wouldn't have gotten into journalism.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.740]   I mean, it's a vow of poverty.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.420]   So it's a little off the track.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:16.660]   But here's what we do.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.660]   We should do an alphabet like restructuring for Twit,
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:22.660]   and I can run the VC wing.
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:23.500]   We can call it--
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:24.020]   That's good.
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:25.140]   We just got ventures.
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:26.700]   Yeah, twin ventures.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.220]   Exactly.
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.220]   Where do you want in on this?
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:31.060]   Yes, I'm you up.
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:32.340]   Have you considered that ever?
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.500]   I mean, here you are.
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:34.780]   You're sitting in the catbird seat.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:36.620]   You've got a ringside seat.
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:41.620]   You know where the big guys are where the money's going?
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.980]   So I'm in a consulting business.
[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:45.540]   So everybody comes to me, if you want a piece of my business,
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.420]   in exchange for building it.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.420]   And I'm like, no.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.620]   Because people coming to me are not the big players,
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.300]   but I feel it's more important for me
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:58.420]   to build out software and features that I think I could
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:58.920]   control.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.020]   Oh, that's so anachronistic.
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.460]   You want to create something instead of just getting rich?
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.740]   What are you nuts?
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:05.260]   I know, right?
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:07.580]   Like, why would I get into a new selling synagogue software?
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:08.420]   That's so small.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:12.100]   You should demand a percentage of the synagogue donations.
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:12.740]   That would be big.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:13.740]   That would be huge.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:19.380]   So I remember there was a PR woman.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.220]   I don't remember the name.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.420]   I think it was antenna.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.020]   Remember antenna PR or antenna?
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:24.140]   No.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.660]   She was very smart.
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:30.220]   She said to companies, I will do your PR for you
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:32.020]   as a startup for you.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:34.260]   Just give me 1,000 shares.
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.540]   And if you're a startup, you're worth nothing.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:38.820]   She did very, very well.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:40.980]   I think among other companies, there
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:45.260]   were some pretty big names in there, like Google.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.700]   And what's funny about that is what's interesting, of course,
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:52.860]   is when you're an investor, if you strike
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.900]   at rich with 2% of your investments, you're doing great.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:57.620]   Well, that's right.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:59.180]   You're going to fail on most of them.
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.740]   And this is essentially the same bet.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:03.740]   It's like the guy who painted the mural at Facebook.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:04.380]   Remember that?
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.300]   No.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.340]   Yeah, Mark said, I can't pay you to paint this mural on the wall,
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:10.100]   but I'll give you a stock.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:11.100]   Millionaire?
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:14.060]   It's like the massage therapist in the early days
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.700]   at Facebook.
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.300]   Multi-millionaire.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:22.940]   I had a friend around 1999 or whatever that he had--
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.540]   good friends of his, they were neighbors.
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:27.540]   And they had this incredible McMansion.
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:33.220]   And they were-- I think the woman in the couple was--
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.900]   she was a personal assistant or something at Yahoo
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.260]   when they went public.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:38.740]   Nice.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:41.100]   And she got a little bit of stock, which was huge back then.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.140]   And yeah, that's good work if you got--
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.260]   But you got to know when to hold them,
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.460]   and you got to know when to fold them.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.420]   And I hope she sold that.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:47.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   Exactly.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.220]   All right, here's from our chat room.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:56.340]   The latest video from Google Play Music, a 360 degree
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.820]   experience.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.460]   This is on YouTube.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.860]   Hey, before we play this, I just want
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.740]   to mention that I watched the Democratic debate last night
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:04.940]   in my year VR.
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.420]   How boring was that?
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.660]   It was nauseating.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.500]   But I wasn't sure if it was the content.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:10.500]   It's tough.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.340]   But it was really--
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:12.620]   It was actually very cool.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.500]   I couldn't do it for more than 20 minutes.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.860]   But they had cameras on the stage, on left and right.
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:20.460]   And they started off with a camera way in the back.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:25.060]   And these VR cameras, they looked like just weird golf balls
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.540]   with lots of cameras on them.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.420]   And I'm sure people didn't realize what that was,
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:30.340]   because I'm sitting here at the beginning.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:31.020]   I'm looking down.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:32.220]   There's a guy looking at his phone.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:33.780]   I can look right at his phone.
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:34.420]   I'm looking over here.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.620]   The camera guy is chewing gum.
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:37.540]   And he's like next to me.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:39.060]   I'm looking, hey, how you doing?
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.780]   And then I could see like Cheryl Crowe
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.020]   tucking in her shirt before she came out.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.820]   Like they show the steady cam guy, your backstage,
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.660]   with the steady cam guy and Cheryl Crowe.
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:52.420]   And she doesn't realize there's a golf ball camera right there.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.780]   This is going to change the world.
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:55.860]   You're going to be able to spy on all sorts of stuff.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.780]   So that was actually a very interesting experience.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.940]   And you know why it's good for the debate?
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:02.500]   Because you're not dependent on the director's cut
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.860]   to see what the reactions are.
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:06.300]   So you can look at each candidate as the other candidates
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:06.980]   are talking.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:07.460]   Exactly.
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.780]   And actually, I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:10.940]   So let me see.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.940]   What, turn your volume up.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:13.380]   What are we going to see here?
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:14.460]   OK.
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:17.900]   Oh, this is that thing where you can watch a video.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:22.220]   Oh, but I have to get the controls working.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:24.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.180]   So you're watching a music video.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:28.220]   What's that?
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.660]   Why is it pointing at that?
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:33.540]   Should I go there?
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.820]   Oh, whoa.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:39.260]   Let's not-- wow.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.140]   A mouse is not a great interface for a video.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:41.460]   No, no.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:44.140]   You want to wear this with-- but I can't show you what it looks
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.020]   like with the helmet on.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.300]   Exactly.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:46.980]   That's interesting.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:50.660]   Now, do you think there'll be more 360 degree music videos?
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:54.980]   When I get that theta, Ricoh theta S in a couple of weeks,
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:57.060]   I'm going to do the podcast 360 degrees.
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.860]   Then you'll be able to see the engineers screwing off
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:04.180]   in the back while I'm working.
[01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:06.300]   Hey, I want to thank you very shorts for being here.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:09.740]   Barry writes at searchengineland.com.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:12.020]   I hope the thing with the Shul Cloud works out OK.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:14.420]   The Europeans don't get you.
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.260]   Thank you.
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:15.940]   I appreciate it.
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:16.740]   It's great being here.
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:17.540]   I appreciate it.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:17.980]   Thank you.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:20.620]   @rustybrick on the Twitter.
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:23.700]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.940]   So if you are in Israel, we're holding a conference
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.300]   for Search Marketing Expo, which is part of the Search
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.340]   Engine Land brand November 1 on a Sunday.
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:33.740]   So if you are in the Israel region,
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:36.860]   go to searchmarketexpo.com/Israel
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.700]   and sign up for the event.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:40.620]   Nice.
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:41.260]   That's great.
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:43.060]   And of course, searchengineland.com,
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.660]   the place to read Barry's bylined work.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:46.020]   Oh, look.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:49.100]   See, now he's driving in the car in the 360 video.
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.860]   And I can look outside the window.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:52.940]   Can't look behind me, though.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:53.740]   Who's in the back seat?
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:55.540]   We'll never know.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:56.980]   I like this idea.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:00.020]   I think we're going to see a lot more of this, right?
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:00.700]   Yes, we are.
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.460]   We're going to look around.
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.140]   I don't know if--
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:05.060]   I've just recently started an oldish book called Ready Player,
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:06.460]   one which you're very familiar with.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:06.820]   Sure.
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:10.540]   And that is such a clear vision of where this is all going on.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.340]   Just a matter of time.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:12.220]   Depressing, but clear.
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.500]   I love it.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:14.060]   I love it.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.540]   Although some people still get nauseous.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:18.940]   I tried to-- Lisa was going to watch the Democratic debate
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.260]   in the thing, and she was like five seconds.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.380]   She said, I'm getting queasy.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.220]   I can't do it.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:24.100]   But she's a Republican.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:27.820]   So maybe there's other reasons why.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:29.860]   Mike, I'll get us the great-- always great to have you.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:32.380]   And you're spirited to the defensive Google Plus.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.380]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.180]   Keep on tilt until it will win mills.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:36.100]   Thank you.
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:39.020]   You catch Mike every Monday through Friday, 10 AM Pacific,
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.500]   1 PM Eastern time for tech news today.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500]   That's our morning news program.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:45.060]   That's right.
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.820]   And pretty regularly, I own Twig, which is great.
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:48.620]   I love having you here.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.660]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.820]   Thanks, Jason Howell, our producer.
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:53.180]   Put together a great show.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:53.740]   You betcha.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:56.380]   By the way, if you didn't see all about Android from last night,
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.940]   they had the new Robin phone, right?
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.380]   Yeah, next bit, Robin.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:03.940]   We had the folks from Nextbit in the house.
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:06.660]   And yeah, it was a great interview.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.660]   We got to play around with the Robin,
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:11.380]   which if you haven't seen it from the Kickstarter,
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.940]   well, it looks like you just pulled it up.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:16.660]   Very unique, different looking design.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:19.620]   It looks just like this, although it was comfortable.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.940]   It looks very rigid.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.540]   And that was my main concern of those sharp corners.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:24.380]   Very sharp.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:25.900]   It looks very sharp on the corners.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.020]   And it's actually a pretty darn comfy device.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:29.060]   You can ship ice with it.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.220]   He says, definitely in January, they're
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:34.260]   on track to get it out when they said they would get it out,
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:37.780]   which with Kickstarter is never a given.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.020]   In fact, another 3D printer company just
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:44.260]   went belly up after raising some $3 million on Kickstarter.
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:46.780]   Said, you know, those of you who haven't got your printer,
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:48.700]   you're not going to get it.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.820]   This one, though, I think they're going to come through.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.500]   They have some people behind it are pretty sharp.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.620]   Scott Croyel, who was who we had on last night,
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:02.260]   he was pretty much the main design guy behind the original HTC
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.140]   known series.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:05.380]   So, you know, and in my opinion, that's
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:10.020]   one of the devices that really elevated Android device design.
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.780]   And everybody kind of played catch up from there.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.340]   So pretty influential as far as that's concerned.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:17.300]   So it's interesting to see them doing something so different.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:18.780]   It will be interesting to see.
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:21.980]   I ordered one, so I'll be getting mine in January.
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:23.500]   The thing that's unique about this,
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.020]   it's a little bit constrained on memory.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.100]   What's 32 gigs or 16?
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:27.620]   I can't remember.
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:29.100]   It's not a lot of storage.
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:34.500]   But the reason is apps, when you don't use them, go up to the cloud.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.420]   And when you hit them, if you want it back,
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:39.900]   it'll re-download it after a short period.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:42.860]   And it does it kind of smartly for you,
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.260]   so you don't have to manage that.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.980]   In fact, right now, you can't explicitly say,
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:48.340]   send this one up to the cloud.
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:49.420]   It does it all for you.
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.660]   And it was very interesting.
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:53.780]   He demonstrated that by recording a video that was longer
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:56.340]   than the storage capacity left on the device.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:58.180]   And you never knew it.
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:00.420]   Because in the background, it was doing the things
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:05.580]   and making the decision to send an app you haven't used in months
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.740]   up to the cloud to make more space for it.
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:09.460]   It's very cool.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:13.460]   Well, watch All About Android from last night.
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.340]   And as always, a great show for an Android fan.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.700]   Thank you for being here.
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.420]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday,

[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:46.580]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:48.700]   Bye bye.
