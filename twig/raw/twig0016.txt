[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.880]   It's time for this week in Google to show the covers,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.840]   all things Google-ish and cloud computing.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.480]   Joining us now, it's really a veritable clue game of people
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.640]   starting with Jeff Jarvis, who's in the library.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.320]   What weapon of your choice, Jeff?
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   With a knife.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   With an ethernet cable.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.800]   With an ethernet cable.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.160]   That's good.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.660]   I like it.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.360]   Jeff Jarvis in the library with an ethernet cable.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960]   And Gina Trapani, who's in the green room
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.960]   with a bicycle pump.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.160]   What is your weapon of choice?
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160]   Firewire drive.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.240]   Firewire drive.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.200]   And welcoming back for her second appearance
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.360]   on this week in Google, Mary Hodder in the kitchen with--
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.960]   I don't know.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   For Sim and Kate.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.160]   I should have the knife.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   I should have the knife.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.640]   You can show.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm sorry, I--
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.680]   With a silicone spatula.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.480]   Do you use those new--
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.840]   Mary, besides being a brilliant writer and blogger
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.680]   and talking about all of this stuff that we talk about,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.200]   including telecom stuff, she's an expert in the small devices,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.400]   is famed baker and cook.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.760]   Do you use those silicone--
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.280]   I do.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.680]   You know, my favorite silicone thing is this little thing
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.320]   kind of shaped like this with these little squiggly things
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.880]   at the end.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   And it's for basting meat with a grill.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   And they don't melt.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.120]   And it's so cool.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.560]   It's rubber, but it doesn't melt.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   It's really incredible.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.320]   I fully expect in a few years for someone
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.240]   to come out and be like, you know, everyone
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.520]   who's been cooking with this stuff,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.200]   you're all going to die soon for some reason.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.280]   But it's still really great.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.760]   I'm with you.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.320]   I have one.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.840]   I love those.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.400]   I love those.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.120]   Napsterization.org/stories is the place
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   to read Mary's postings, most recently, about transparency
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.800]   camp.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.120]   You've got to get another post up there.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.480]   That's from August.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.960]   I know.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.480]   Get out of the kitchen.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.720]   I actually have like 10 posts written.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.120]   You know, the problem with blogging as you sort of evolve
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.280]   is that you realize the complexity of the issues
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.080]   and what used to just be like a quick blog post that you
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320]   would dash off in a couple of paragraphs.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.200]   Now when you think about the same issue,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.440]   it's like, you know, a book.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.520]   And it--
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   It's a lot harder than I've always seen.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.000]   You've got the easy ones off on Twitter.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.600]   And then the blog posts become that much bigger as a result.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.360]   The only thing that's left is the 2000 word tomes.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.520]   And then it's like a day and a half.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.160]   And--
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.640]   Right.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.160]   I'm with you.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.400]   We're all in the same boat.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.880]   We're all suffering this.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.960]   I blame Twitter.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.520]   Well, if Matt--
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.400]   It's the where you go.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.240]   --how we can do it in a week.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.200]   Do you all see Matt how he's posted this week?
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.640]   Well, no.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.240]   Was it really long?
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's absolutely incredible.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.080]   He announced on Twitter, I guess, a week ago,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.360]   that he was basically--
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.600]   basically, he had brain tumor.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   He thought.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   Oh, dear.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.680]   Last we heard.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   So we had to come back and explain everything.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.400]   And it looks like it'll be OK.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.600]   He has something in his brain that they
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.080]   hope they can treat with hormones.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.040]   But considering the shape that he's in,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.680]   he went into incredible and witty detail of this.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.760]   And partly because Neil Dash started a movement
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.880]   to show him what he'd gone through,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   he describes it in the post to say
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.640]   that he was seeing his own funeral with the--
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.920]   But it's amazing how you live in public.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.000]   And there's Matt saying something on Twitter,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.200]   because it's what you're doing right now?
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.960]   Well, I'm in the hospital about to go into an MRI.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.200]   And it just follows through.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.920]   You can't-- then now you have to write the blog post.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.720]   Is that what happened to you?
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.040]   You kind of had to write the blog post.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.800]   It becomes kind of an obligation to transparency
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   to all your friends.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.000]   Matt is one of the founders of a meta-factor.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.480]   And his blog is a whole lot and nothing.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.280]   A. whole lot of nothing.org.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.600]   If you want to read the post.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.000]   Yeah, there were over 2000 tweets tagged.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.200]   The hashtag was #MattHowieLove, where people were saying
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.680]   why it is that they looked up to Matt and wishing him well
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.760]   and telling him to get better.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.480]   And it was an unbelievable thing to watch.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.800]   And I'm sure that he just had so many people on meta-filter
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.320]   on Twitter wondering what happened and what the update was.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.280]   And that blog post was unbelievable.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.600]   But he said that the tweets made him cry.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.160]   And he was in the hospital because he
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.040]   felt like he was getting to hear all the things
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.600]   that people would have said about him at his funeral.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.840]   It just broke my heart.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.600]   Well, thank God he's OK.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.920]   Yeah, it looks like he will be.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.640]   It looks like that they hope it will be.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.720]   He says he went to the hospital with a bad flu.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   And two hours later, a routine CAT scan on his head
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.400]   found a lump.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.560]   That's just-- you know what's interesting, though?
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   This is really, I think, a measure
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.000]   of the evolution of these tools that we're really
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.640]   able to have community around these tools now.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.960]   It feels like it's a little more personal than it was
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.760]   when it was just blogs.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.840]   Is that me or is that the case?
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   I think it's part of the ambient intimacy.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720]   We just update people on little bits of our lives.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.800]   I absolutely agree.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   The idea that you can share these pieces that
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   are much more personal-- and I think Twitter, for me,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.520]   feels better.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.320]   It feels like a better place to do that.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.000]   I wouldn't put it on my blog, because that's
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   where I talk about serious issues or my food blog or whatever.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.360]   But the idea that I could say yesterday afternoon,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.480]   I was just so looking forward to taking a nap, which
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.640]   is so unbelievably boring.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.880]   But for anybody who knows me, they
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.720]   know what's going on with me right at that moment.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   Right.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   Right.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560]   One of the most amazing tales I've seen is Penelope Trunk,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.800]   who tweeted her miscarriage in a board meeting
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000]   of her company.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.360]   And she said she was glad, because otherwise she
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.520]   was going to have to get an abortion.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.320]   So there was much fewer, much hubble on TV.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.720]   So all kinds of things.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.120]   But she just said women have to be
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.840]   able to talk about their lives.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.760]   And that includes this.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   And she is eloquent in her defense.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000]   She also talks about-- she says she has Asperger's syndrome
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   and how she has worked through that,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   what that does in her company.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.840]   Incredible transparency and a courage that comes in that.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.960]   That's really quite amazing.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.160]   Even against that kind of attack that you can believe she got.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.440]   Are the attacks going to go away?
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.000]   Are we going to get more comfortable with people
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   telling the truth and being honest and forthright
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.680]   and transparent?
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:26.960]   And maybe the attacks are just kind of the biosphere saying,
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.320]   oh, that makes us cringy and then getting used to it, maybe,
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.080]   and saying, oh, OK.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.760]   Or is it just going to get worse?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   I argue there's a theory of mutually assured humiliation.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.400]   Once we have all told our story, yeah.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.280]   You talk about your prostate.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.840]   That's right.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   On the one hand, you have all the troll activity
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.280]   where people are really into just baiting.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.720]   You know, the--
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.200]   I mean, it can be--
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.960]   I mean, people say that Andrew Keen is a troll, right?
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.160]   No, I love Andrew, though.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.280]   He writes-- I know.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.680]   I like Andrew, too, and he's a friend,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.320]   and he lives near me and blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.880]   But I mean, you have that kind of stuff.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.600]   You have people who are--
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.480]   you know, you have the anonymous folks who
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   are constantly baiting the sociology people.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   You can't--
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.680]   If you have a byline like Andrew does,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.240]   that's not trolling.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.920]   That may be provocative, although Michael Arrington's
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.560]   kind of a troll.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.880]   But the definition--
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.080]   You're so excited.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   Maybe you can, Nick.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.400]   Definitely should have trolling is
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.120]   that you're baiting people.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.520]   Right.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.920]   And the thing is, is that when Andrew comes out with a book
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   and says, you know, everything online is crap.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.720]   That was trolling.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.400]   And the analog world was the best.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.080]   You know, well, OK, that's a kind of troll.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.520]   And then showing up at a bunch of like internet-focused
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.080]   conferences, you know, I mean, you're trolling.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.920]   It's just doing it in person, you know?
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.280]   So I don't know.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.240]   I mean, there's that, and then there's people who--
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.440]   I mean, Gina can probably speak to this as well.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.120]   But, you know, I get death threats, all, you know,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.320]   like on a regular basis.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.840]   Shitting.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.880]   I mean, welcome to being a woman on the internet.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.680]   On the internet?
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   Who has a--
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   So Kathy Sierra's horrible experience
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.200]   was not isolated, you're saying this is common.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.720]   No.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.200]   Definitely.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.400]   I mean, well, the thing that was different about her thing
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.480]   was that somebody put in a lot of time
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.880]   and was consistently going after her.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.840]   And so it was the over time this is freaking me out kind of thing.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.340]   Right.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.280]   That's my standard.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.440]   And it was before her incident is, OK, so I get these things,
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.840]   and I kind of blow them off because I figure someone's just
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.560]   mad and they say something.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.280]   But if they spend a lot of time and are consistently
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.760]   doing something really freaky, OK, that's
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.160]   where I'm going to go do something and have to take action.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.480]   You know, it's interesting they say that because I've
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   been a public figure on the radio, TV, and the internet
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.120]   for 32 years, never once received a death threat, never once.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.020]   My daughter does a podcast for two months and gets a death
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.280]   threat.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.440]   So maybe it is gender based.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.400]   It reflects badly on men, if that's the case.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.400]   Gender is part of the--
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   They were all from that.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.240]   I mean, you're on TV.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.880]   I think people on the internet just seem a lot more accessible,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.760]   a lot more easy to harass, you know what I mean,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.440]   versus being on TV or the radio.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.040]   Like, because of the nature of the medium?
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.600]   I think-- no, no, no.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.760]   I think every woman on television has had maybe not death threats
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.880]   per se, although some of that, but a lot of nasty stuff.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.760]   Every woman I've worked with on television
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.240]   has had much more problems-- many more problems with stalkers,
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.440]   creeps, threats of all kinds than I've ever had.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.840]   That makes me so sad.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.360]   That's so horrible.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.880]   There's such value in publicness.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.760]   And then, you know, to scare people off of this--
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   terrible.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.080]   New social world is such a horrible waste
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   that someone can ruin it so easily.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.600]   Mary, you're saying you're willing to put up with it?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.960]   I said, you know, I'm willing to put a lot of information
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.760]   about myself out publicly.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.720]   But, you know, my address is never online.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.680]   And there's just certain things that I just won't put out
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.440]   there, because I know this is a problem.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   And, you know, you get these things.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.560]   And it's on a semi-regular basis.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.320]   Even now, you know, I'm in stealth mode making a new company,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.040]   right?
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   And even now, just because I have a blog
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.800]   and I go to conferences and I occasionally speak,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   it happens.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.920]   People get-- basically, it's mostly done.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.240]   And yet, I have an open door here.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.720]   We publish our address.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.920]   People wander in almost every day and say, hi.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.760]   Maybe I'm crazy.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.800]   But I think it's gender-based.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.320]   I really do.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.680]   And I think that that's horrible.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.280]   And it's something we've really got to resolve.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.080]   This troll problem, in general, is something we have to solve.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.200]   And I would hope that openness and transparency
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.440]   might become so commonplace that we kind of get over it
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.120]   and start realizing that we're all real people.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   I think initially, when you experience somebody
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.800]   on the internet, you don't have a sense of them
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.520]   as a real person.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.600]   I know when I read comments, for instance, on my blog,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.680]   I assume everybody's just like me.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.080]   And so I give them perhaps more weight
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.560]   than I should in some cases.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.640]   And I think when people experience somebody in a medium--
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.880]   I think it's true of TV and radio as much as the internet.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.720]   But let's say the internet.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.960]   Initially, in the early days, there
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.360]   wasn't a sense that this is a real person on the other end.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.800]   But the more we get a sense that this
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.840]   is a real person, a vulnerable person,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.400]   this could be your mother or your sister,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.760]   don't you think that will help?
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   I think it helps.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.240]   But the other piece is, is anybody rallying around
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.080]   and being the community to help?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.000]   There was a comic this week that came out,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.720]   or maybe it was from last Monday's issue of The New Yorker,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.440]   which I put up on my Flickr stream.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.000]   And it was a panel of guys.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.640]   And they're saying, the topic of this week's panel
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.120]   is, why are there no women on this panel?
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.600]   And so Kalia Hamlin is doing a panel
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.640]   at South by Southwest in the spring
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.200]   about with a bunch of guys.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.920]   And she's just going to pick a group of guys
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.440]   to talk about what they're doing
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.600]   and what other guys are doing to deal with some of the issues
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.720]   that women in technology face.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.960]   And it's a really interesting take on the problem
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.240]   because we hate complaining.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.760]   We hate whining about the fact that there's certain things
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.400]   that really suck for us.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.480]   And I don't want to spend my time on that.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.680]   I want to be a technologist.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.720]   That's what I really do.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.480]   That's what I spend most of my time on.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.680]   But I also recognize that her approach on this panel,
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.480]   which is to get guys focused on helping
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.360]   be part of the community so that you just
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.200]   don't have to be self-defending.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   You can actually have a community that
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.800]   looks at the issue and says, hey, maybe we can do something
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.520]   about x, y, or z issue is a lot better.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.360]   But we're not-- we may be good having community
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   with Twitter and sharing some of our personal experiences.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.120]   But I don't think we're quite there yet where we say, OK,
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.720]   it's really important that we do x things.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.440]   And everybody has to rally around or it's not going to help.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.120]   It doesn't just help if the women defend themselves
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.760]   or the minorities defend themselves
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.040]   or the children defend themselves.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.120]   Like the whole community has to do it.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.160]   Well, in fact, Kathy Sierra got a lot more heat
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.040]   because of coming forward that unnecessarily--
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.000]   I mean, that was terrible.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.280]   The way people were-- some people
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.960]   responded to her situation was devastating.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   I think it's important to talk about this.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.600]   I know this isn't really about Google,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.520]   but it is about life in the cloud.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.600]   It's about life in the cloud.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.280]   And I think it's really important to talk about it
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   because I think as people--
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.360]   I think some of it is people don't realize what it's like.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.400]   And so it's important to let the world know
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.840]   that it is kind of nasty out there.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.320]   And we need to do something about it
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.480]   because we want to use these tools.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.240]   We want to be public.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.800]   We want to be transparent.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.360]   Danny O'Brien always says that bloggers are famous enough
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.440]   to have stalkers but not famous enough to have bodyguards.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.000]   And that's really true.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.480]   I don't really talk about it.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.160]   I've dealt with these kinds of issues for a long time
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.280]   as I assume most public women on the internet
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.760]   or on TV or radio do.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.240]   And my response is just to show up on Tweg every week
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.800]   and to put out a new book and to do another blog post
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.840]   and just keep-- every time I do that, I feel like I'm saying,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.280]   screw you.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.520]   I'm not going to anyone who's ever tried to threaten me
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.080]   or shut me up in any way.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   I take it as a personal somebody's trying to shut me up,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.880]   so I'm just going to keep talking.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.520]   But I think it's important to do what Kalea is doing as well.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.880]   A few years ago, I just got so tired
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.360]   of the wear of the women panels and conversations that
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.640]   happen at a lot of conferences.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.160]   I'm so glad that they're happening.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.120]   But I just want to talk about technology.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.800]   I don't want to talk about this as much,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.960]   probably maybe to a fault.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.000]   I mean, I should be talking about it more.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.880]   Well, part of technology is, are the new social rules
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.840]   that spring up around these new media and the new ways
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.800]   that we relate to each other?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.480]   And I think that we have to talk about those
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.680]   and talk about what goes on so that we can absorb it and use it.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.600]   I think we can't just lightly go along and say, well,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.160]   it's just like the real world, only virtual, because it isn't.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.080]   Well, it is to the extent the real world has bozos,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.560]   and there are bozos on the internet as well.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.920]   And I think it's important not to assume that everyone
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.520]   is a bozo that we judge under the lowest common denominator.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.480]   None of us does.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.080]   Jimmy Wales, when he won an award at the Monaco Media Forum
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.840]   this week, said the greatest lesson in Wikipedia
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.440]   is people are basically good.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.720]   And Wikipedia is built on that, like Google, like the cloud,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.840]   like most applications, it has to be built also
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.760]   to protect against the one bozo who can ruin the whole party.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.880]   Wikipedia is looking for money again.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Jimmy has done an interesting thing.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.800]   He could make millions and millions every year
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.400]   by just taking a few ads, a few judicious ads on Wikipedia.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.680]   And yet, to his great credit and the foundation's great credit,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.080]   they've started a new campaign to raise, what is it,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   seven and a half million that they need to run?
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.160]   They're actually running deficit.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.280]   The cost of Wikipedia is nine million a year, I think.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.560]   Wow.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.080]   That's an amazing number.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.400]   And it's such a treasure.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   I want to say a resource, but it's more than a resource.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   It's a treasure of the internet.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.000]   And it's kind of stunning to think that they--
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.080]   well, I mean, thank goodness people donate.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   Wikipedia forever is the new tagline if you want to donate.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.960]   Sue Gardner, who's the head of the foundation,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.000]   said that they actually don't have a lot of trouble as a rule,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   getting the money to run it.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.720]   And it takes very little money if you consider the size that it is.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.720]   That it's this huge resource that we have.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.680]   If I said this in a previous show, stop me.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.720]   I'm of the age when this happens.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.280]   But she said at the Aspen Institute
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.840]   that they calculated just the value of the edits that
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.920]   occur on Wikipedia in a year.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.360]   And they ascribed a low per hour labor cost to that,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.560]   barely above minimum wage.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.280]   And it still added up to hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.800]   of value a year.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.880]   That's a non-monetary value that makes Wikipedia Wikipedia
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.920]   and makes it possible to create this incredible resource
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.680]   on what is in that concept, that perspective, very little money.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.320]   They say one of the top five visited websites in the world,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.640]   35 people is all they employ.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.080]   Most of the money goes to, I'm sure, surfers and bandwidth.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.480]   Well, you consider that Craigslist has what now?
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.720]   I think 30 employees, and though they'll never say it,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.480]   the reported income of Craigslist is $100 million.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.960]   I mean, imagine--
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.540]   And that was part of the process of doing in $10 billion
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.880]   worth of classified ad revenue.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.560]   By the way, Craig just joined Wikimedia's advice report.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.120]   So I don't know if there's some nexus there,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.880]   but maybe he can help them figure out a way.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.480]   Speaking of bozos, Rupert Murdoch--
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.760]   Where have we talked?
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.520]   Rupert Murdoch, that's all I have to say.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.000]   You know what?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.360]   You only have to say his name, and everyone who's
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.520]   in internet land will just laugh.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.640]   Well, that's the last word now, because he's
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.040]   talking about cutting off Google.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.120]   Yeah, crazy.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.600]   Corey Doc wrote a brilliant post and then a column
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.640]   for The Guardian when he just said
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.960]   he was an old man shuffling along.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.360]   Michael Wolf said that as of a year ago,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.480]   the man had never used Google.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.840]   He calls Google a plagiarist.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.920]   And a few other nasty words and talks about cutting it off.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.440]   I put up a post on my blog with some German stats
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.920]   that a company did that said that they looked at all the German
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.800]   sites and saw that news sites accounted for only 5%--
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.960]   or the part of this way.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   And on all the German sites they could track,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.280]   German search queries on Google, news sites
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.160]   didn't show up on the first page on 95% of them.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.000]   So they showed up only on the first page on 5% of them.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.560]   The number one squat in a search result,
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.480]   news sites had 4.1% of them.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.880]   Wikipedia had 13.6% of them.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.760]   So they should be complaining.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.600]   Wikipedia.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.480]   There's a good idea.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.880]   Let's have Wikipedia off of Google.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.360]   Anybody with any-- now, Jason Calicanis
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   had an interesting point in his newsletter.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.880]   He said, but what if Rupert's crazy like a fox?
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.920]   What if he and all of the other content providers
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   pulled their content off of Google?
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.360]   I think we talked--
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.240]   But they're not going to.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.800]   But they're not going to.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.240]   Anybody's going to come in and ruin the party.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.040]   Number one, number two, Rupert gets $300 million
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.480]   from my space, which he's trying to negotiate.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.360]   Jason also talked about the New York Times doing this.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.640]   Well, about.com, which is owned by the New York Times.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.160]   And it's the only bright spot in the entire company, P&L.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.000]   It gets 80% of its traffic and 50% of its revenue from Google.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.400]   Well, I guess there you go.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.880]   You just said it.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.560]   They're not going to--
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.960]   From their nose.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.400]   Not happening, Jason.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   So what's going to happen to Rupert?
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.160]   Well, some publishers I think might actually do this.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.120]   But I think that they will--
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.560]   Rupert is the pied piper trying to lead them off the cliff.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.600]   Come with me, lemmings.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.840]   Come with me.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.400]   Who needs to find you on the internet?
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.960]   That's overrated.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.640]   I think the best thing Corey said was
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.440]   that he described him as a mustache-torler.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.680]   He's like, so, you know, like--
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.160]   Snitely, Murdoch.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.000]   Exactly.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.040]   But you know what's funny about that is that I think what he
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:52.320]   did was throw out this argument, this stance,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.840]   and try to do a momentum play to see if a bunch of people
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.600]   would follow him, because they're not going to do it
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.520]   until next June.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.080]   And then there was some announcement later this week
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.360]   that, well, June may slip.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.680]   And it's like, you know, I think what they're hoping
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.600]   is that a bunch of people come in behind them and say, OK,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.880]   we'll go along with it.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.160]   We'll all do it together and see what happens.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.200]   But, you know, I just don't--
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.240]   I like Jeff.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.760]   I mean, I just don't see it.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.080]   I don't see any of them doing it.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.840]   And I see the whole thing in the spring just being quietly
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.840]   like swept under the rug.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.000]   I think you're exactly right, Mary.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   It's an attempt to bring others along.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.200]   And negotiate with Google.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.000]   Well, they don't understand any essential architecture
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.840]   of the link economy.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.640]   Sorry, I said it again, is that it's up to the recipient
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.080]   of the link to take the value out of this.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   And newspapers don't have nearly enough traffic,
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.280]   and nearly enough engagement with the audience.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.400]   I saw an editor from a UK newspaper group say,
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.240]   we already have enough audience.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.840]   How could our newspapers say that?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.760]   That's because they're not monetizing the traffic they're
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.560]   getting from Google.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.080]   We don't want anymore.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.360]   Who needs more readers?
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.680]   So it's not-- it's interesting.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   I just assumed his problem was with Google News.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.160]   It's with Google search results in general.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   It's what they're saying.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.240]   They're trying to act all tough.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.080]   It's that Australian macho thing.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.880]   Oh, man.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.400]   Well, it just makes you a clueless, Rupert.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.120]   It also kind of reminds me of every time
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.800]   the AT&T CEO or other CEOs of giant telco ISP types
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600]   go on about how Google should pay them,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.520]   because they're helping them deliver their search results
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.040]   or whatever it is, whatever piece of Google site
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.320]   that users are going to.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.080]   And I mean, if you're in this, you
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.600]   know that the users are paying for their bandwidth,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.000]   Google's paying for their bandwidth.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.840]   It's completely ridiculous.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.640]   But it's this sort of stupid legacy way of thinking.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.360]   They're trying to impose the cable model on Google and bandwidth.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.720]   And it's Rupert Murdoch trying to impose some kind of legacy
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.200]   understanding of the world.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.880]   It's just-- it's like not how it is.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.120]   And there's just no way this is ever going to work.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   Nice try.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.440]   I wrote a post last week arguing that the future of news
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.960]   is entrepreneurial, not institutional.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.680]   I don't think that the institutions can see the world
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.120]   this new way.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.760]   I finally give up.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.880]   I tried for 15 years, personally.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.120]   And I think that it's too painful to shrink down
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.280]   to the appropriate size for a web business
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.160]   and a member of a network rather than the owner of everything.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.720]   And I think it's a shame because a lot of people
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.880]   are going to suffer along the way.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.600]   They already are.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   But that's the new reality.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.200]   I like it.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.840]   I like it.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.680]   And I think you're right.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.280]   I think that's becoming clear and clear.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.200]   I don't think you can even deny that at this point.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.920]   How's the book doing?
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:49.920]   Gina's Google Wavebook is online at--
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.400]   Gina?
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.000]   Completewaveguide.com.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.160]   Complete waveguide.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.360]   I think there's a little bit of a delay here for some reason.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.440]   I think there's delay because you just
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.680]   don't want the site to go down again.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.160]   I don't know.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.040]   Should I say it?
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   No, there's that.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.160]   Should I mention it?
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.960]   The book is doing great.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   And actually, the PDF is going to be available this week.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.960]   I'm editing and doing the final copy edits tonight.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   That's what I wanted to know.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.600]   That's exciting.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.400]   So that'll be fun.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.360]   I'm going to do a talk on Wave at Web 2.0 Expo this week
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.280]   on Wednesday.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.800]   And the book should be available as a PDF until then.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.440]   But until then, it will always be available at completewaveguide.com
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.040]   in full.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.600]   And the site is coming along.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.560]   It's a little slow right now, but it's coming up.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.120]   It'll be up any minute now.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.760]   I'm sure it will.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:39.360]   It's just a matter of time, completed eight of 11 items.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.280]   OK, I think we've got it.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's a lot said this week that they might now
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.880]   put site page speed as a factor in page rank.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.560]   So what up?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.720]   Yeah, I'm screwed.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.840]   Well, you know what?
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.120]   It got in.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.080]   We didn't get all the graphics, but we got the text.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.920]   And that's what matters.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.420]   All right.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.400]   That's what's important.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   Oh.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.920]   Yeah, it's what can take down a site.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.600]   And one fells--
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.080]   One fells, it's all it takes.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.120]   Hey, have you thought about an audio version of this book?
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.440]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.320]   I'd like to volunteer if you--
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.640]   somebody said, why don't you read it, Leo?
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.880]   And then you could have an audio version.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.480]   It's probably too many demonstrations
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.680]   of how stuff works and stuff, right?
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.720]   Click Next.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.280]   And then choose from the menu.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.160]   Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.880]   Follow along as I explain.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.840]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.920]   I don't know.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.400]   A lot of tech books don't translate well to audio,
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.040]   but there's a lot of pros in this book.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.760]   I don't know.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.360]   I think it'd be kind of fun to make an audio version.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.240]   I just mentioned this.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.880]   So what's the deal with PageRank?
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.840]   Matt says, you got to be fast?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.040]   Well, this is part of this new protocol
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.960]   that I don't understand.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.560]   So Gina will explain it to me.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.720]   The speedy protocol?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.760]   Speedy or Spidey?
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.160]   Is it speedy or Spidey?
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.560]   I don't know.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.080]   It's speedy.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.440]   I think it says speedy.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:56.840]   It's probably--
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   It's supposed to pronounce it speedy.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.800]   It probably is speedy.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.440]   Although, I think for some reason,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   Spidey, because of the Spidey thing, it's the Spidey sense.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.920]   So what is SPDY?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.800]   SPDY is a new protocol for fetching web pages.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.600]   I mean, they're saying it's not new.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.280]   It's actually based on HTTP, but overrides
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.960]   a couple of HTTPs methods to make it a little faster
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.880]   that Google's putting out.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.400]   This is Google's all about being fast, right?
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.920]   With Google Chrome OS, and with Speedy, and with Wave,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.600]   and with Chrome in general.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.520]   But yeah, so Speedy's supposed to make web pages a lot snappier.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.200]   And it's based on HTTP, but it uses a little magic.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.120]   It compresses headers, and it allows for multiplex requests.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.200]   It allows for the web server to prioritize requests.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.320]   So I can say, hey, you know what, that background image,
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.680]   not as important, but the text really important.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.760]   And like I said, it's based on HTTP,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.520]   but it is Google only.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.480]   So someone, I forget what article mentioned that--
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.920]   for it really to take hold, we want the IETF
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.400]   to be in charge of this standard.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.560]   We really don't want Google in charge of the standard,
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.640]   you know, the way that the protocol in which web pages
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   are delivered.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.040]   Would it be something I could add like an Apache module?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.080]   Do I have to run a different server to make it work?
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.040]   How does it--
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.240]   That's what I imagine so.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.640]   This is still really young, but it seems like, yes,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.760]   this is something that would have to be built into both
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.560]   the web server and to the browser.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.200]   So this is going to be the big challenge, too, right?
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.360]   Like they're going to be able to make Chrome understand
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.640]   Speedy requests and get Speedy requests very easily.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.040]   But getting that into Internet Explorer, which doesn't even
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.840]   really support HTML5 yet, might be a challenge.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   But it is-- I imagine-- I'm not sure,
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.840]   but I imagine that the way it works is that there would just
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.040]   be an Apache module that could send, you know,
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.840]   respond to requests via Speedy that way.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.640]   So it wouldn't be required, but if you happen to have the kind
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.840]   of upgrade, it'll make you faster if it's Speedy to Speedy.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.760]   Yeah, I mean, there would have to be some graceful degradation,
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.260]   right?
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.240]   So I imagine that, yeah, your client would make the requests.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.360]   And if the server and the client would both have to be able
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.120]   to talk to one another in Speedy, and I imagine that they
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.160]   would be able to detect that on either end.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.480]   And if not, they would fall back to HTTP, regular, straight up,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.240]   HTTP.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.160]   Mary, I know you're very interested in the mobile phone
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.320]   platforms.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.920]   Are you using a Droid by any chance?
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   No, but I'm really interested in one.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.760]   But actually, I have a comment about--
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.000]   She was trying to grab my Droid.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.800]   Get away from my Droid, Gina.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.440]   Go ahead, Mary.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.720]   You know, I was thinking when she was talking about how
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.800]   you-- the idea that you are a site--
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.560]   so let's say you have a very large site, right?
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.200]   And you have a lot of traffic.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.680]   And so what happens is that as people hit your site,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.160]   things can slow down, well, you can prioritize certain things.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.760]   And you can also block certain things in terms of bots
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.080]   that are spidering you.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.320]   So if you have a large site, a gazillion things
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.520]   are going to try to spider you, not just Google and ask
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.600]   and Bing and whoever.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.720]   There's always 20 bots on my site at any one time.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   And actually, a bunch of them can be kind of destructive.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.160]   So when you figure out what certain bots are,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.240]   you will often block those bots, right?
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.000]   Because they're bad.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.880]   And so the thing that you would do,
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.800]   if you were going to be really sneaky about this,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.840]   is you would say, well, whenever the Google bots show up,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.360]   then prioritize the traffic there,
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   make it load really fast, because that'll
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.800]   get us higher in search results.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.840]   OK.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.240]   Oh, that is clever.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.040]   Interesting.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.400]   The dark part.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.280]   Speedy activate for the Google bots.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.120]   But there are all the other minions
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.600]   that the regular HTTP.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.440]   I'm looking.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.000]   There are 35 people on my site right now, and 16 bots.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.040]   No.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.880]   That's crazy.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.080]   It's crazy.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.320]   And yeah, and so many bots just don't respect
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.920]   robots attacks, or just aggressive,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.560]   and just suck down pages so quickly.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   And the Google bots are actually pretty respectful.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.000]   No, there's two instances of Google bot,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.480]   and there's like 12 instances of MSN.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.360]   Go away.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.040]   And then is there a pipe?
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.360]   Is the bad one too?
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.920]   Pipes?
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.480]   Yeah, the pipes parser.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.640]   Well, that pulls XML.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.160]   Go ahead, Mary.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.080]   Sorry.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.480]   I was just going to say, there are also sites
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.080]   where I think the engineers are just not
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.240]   experienced at creating spiders that are respectful.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.120]   So it's not just the robots.txt.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.160]   But they actually don't know how to deal with how many times
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.880]   are you going to ping an RSS thing,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.080]   or is there some alternative like using the ping
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.600]   amatic or some kind of mesh system or whatever.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.080]   So by the same token, I mean, they really
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.320]   should be looking at every site and saying,
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.400]   we're not sending 12 bots to one site.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.960]   That's just ridiculous.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   That's crazy.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.640]   But that's the kind of stuff that--
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.880]   Oh, what happens to that?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   To me, I say it is inexperienced.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.720]   This is a WordPress thing called users online.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   It's just a little plug-in.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.600]   But it's nice to know.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.040]   I mean, you can see what the bots are scanning and so forth.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.920]   You know what I've been using, which I love, is chart beat.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.240]   It gives you--
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.640]   That thing is like Times Square for websites,
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.120]   where I was like, pull, sing, data.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.640]   What's happening?
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.400]   You got a live heat map and stuff.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.880]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.560]   All right, I'm sorry.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.120]   We'll stop geeking out.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.520]   So, Mary, you haven't got a droid yet?
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.680]   So I don't have a droid.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.480]   No.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.960]   But we are looking at the SDK.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.120]   And, you know, yeah, I know.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.480]   I've seen them, but I haven't.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.280]   I don't have one.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.560]   Although I did actually have a conversation yesterday,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.440]   or maybe Friday with Kevin Marks about--
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.640]   we're scheming about how we can each get one for free.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.760]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.280]   It's pretty expensive when you add up--
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:48.960]   It's expensive.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.480]   The Verizon access for two years, it's expensive.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.560]   So Leo, what's the verdict?
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.000]   Far out.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.640]   It's really much better than I thought.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.440]   You might look at the aero's, because the keyboard--
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.160]   now I have fat fingers, but the keyboard
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.000]   is really hard to type on.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.960]   Yeah, I finally went to Verizon store and played.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.680]   That keyboard is disappointing.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.400]   It's pretty disappointing.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.280]   And I find I don't really open it up that much,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.720]   because the on-screen keyboard--
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.200]   I'm used to it from an iPhone using the on-screen keyboard.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.880]   It's actually a little better than the iPhone keyboard,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.640]   because it's predictive text.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.760]   I like the way Android does it much better,
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.680]   where it gives you a bar above the keyboard
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.640]   with what it thinks you might want.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.360]   Very good.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.560]   It's much better than the iPhone.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.920]   I love my G2 for exactly that reason.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.560]   And I've gotten used to the keyboard now,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.760]   and I don't miss having--
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.680]   I don't think you need this.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.160]   --that's a cool keyboard.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.360]   Yeah, I'm not sure you know this.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.960]   I can go really fast.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.920]   So you might look at the aero's, which is thinner,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.360]   slider, lighter.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.840]   And now, right now, it doesn't have-- it has cupcake on it,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.160]   but it's going to have 2.0.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.440]   And cheaper, too, I think, right?
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.280]   Yeah, 99 bucks.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.680]   And I was told by my Verizon contact
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.360]   that they plan to update to 2.0 soon, like this month.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.600]   So I went to the spot met, so a couple of weeks ago in Chicago.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   And there were all these young girls
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.160]   who were super excited about any kind of gadget.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   And I do have a bunch of phones because we're doing mobile stuff.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.720]   So I gave them my G2, and I said, OK, do something.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.040]   And just the quick, quick thumbing action of these girls
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.080]   was unbelievable.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.160]   I was like, OK, if they can do this,
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.960]   there's no reason to have an actual physical keyboard.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.480]   It was--
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:20.840]   Not at all.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.080]   They were really good and really fast.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   I'm very impressed with the 2.0.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.280]   When you put it on a platform that's speedy--
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.360]   I guess the G2 is pretty speedy, but the Android
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.040]   has a really nice processor.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.600]   This is totally usable.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.520]   The only thing that bugs the heck out of me
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.080]   is there's only three screens.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.440]   They need more screens.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.000]   I don't understand.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.640]   You know, you can--
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.120]   You mean the side of the screen.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.920]   Yeah, it is weird that there's only three.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.440]   You know, you can get add-ons that will allow you to change
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.560]   the home, but they're all crappy, and they slow it down,
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.600]   and they crash and stuff.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.360]   So I have tried them.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.560]   But between widgets and the icons,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.160]   I mean, I've filled up my real estate very quickly,
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.200]   and I could use a lot more.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.560]   But otherwise, it's very good.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.280]   There are a few applications in the iPhone
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.320]   that I love that I miss on here, like Mint,
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.200]   a lot of the photo applications.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.440]   Camera's a little disappointing.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.080]   It's not great.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.240]   It's about as good as the iPhone, not much better,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.080]   despite the megapixel count.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.640]   But it feels good.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.360]   It's a little heavier.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.800]   About six ounces heavier than the iPhone.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.360]   But it feels solid.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.640]   And I think it's a-- I mean, I have no problem using it
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.960]   exclusively, not at all.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.680]   I don't miss my iPhone at all.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.240]   Wow.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.320]   Well, OK, I should be honest.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.760]   I miss it because I can't play my audible books on it,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.360]   but other than that.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.920]   Speaking of which, I should check and see
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.880]   if we have any commercials.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.240]   I've been having so much fun talking about this stuff.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.640]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.000]   We've missed all our commercials.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.480]   Well, let's start with an audible commercial.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.840]   What do you say?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.560]   We have a Ford commercial.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.560]   Oh.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.040]   Wow.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   Yes.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.720]   Ooh, you'd say, ooh, it's funny because I have--
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.600]   one of my philosophies in life is you don't do ads
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.560]   for something you don't use, right?
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.040]   So when Ford said we're going to buy ad time,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   I had to go out and get a Mustang.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   I'm calling for you.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.240]   For you.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.520]   And it's fun to-- I mean, we just--
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.640]   whenever the kids walk by, people have been posing.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.000]   And most things parked out front of them have been posing with it.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.840]   It's this beautiful candy apple red.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   Anyway.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.440]   So are you going to do the ad?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.800]   Yes.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.680]   Do we get to see you driving around in the car?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.200]   No, but that's next week.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.560]   I decided instead of-- because normally I do the ads,
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.160]   I'm just sitting here.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.000]   We talk.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.440]   Next week, I'm going to take a camera,
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.840]   and I'm going to pre-tape ads so you can see it
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.720]   up and driving around.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.040]   But the ad is not for the car.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.080]   The ad is for the thing that comes in the car that
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.880]   is only available in Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.840]   And it's their hands-free Bluetooth system, their audio system.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.920]   And actually, it works great with the Droid,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.960]   except because the Droid doesn't support Audible,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.640]   I can't play my audio books.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.040]   So I have to use the iPhone with my sync.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.320]   And that's actually what I was going to mention.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.040]   I really-- I get in the car.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.000]   And first of all, I can use both phones.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.280]   So you can have up to 25 phones.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.320]   Mary, you'd like that.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.520]   You can have up to 25 phones with the Ford sync.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.440]   I know a stack.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.640]   A stack of phones.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.760]   And you just pick which one you want to make the calls on.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.320]   And so I usually make the calls on the Verizon,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.680]   because I get a better connection.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.560]   But then I listen to the audio.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.520]   It also has a USB connector, which is really nice.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.440]   So with a Zoom or the iPhone, you just bring the appropriate cable.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.680]   You plug it into the USB connector.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.440]   It charges in the music plays through it.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.080]   In fact, it indexes all the contents of the device.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   It works with the Android, too.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.720]   Index is everything that's on there.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.800]   And now I can say, by name, I can say, play this week in Google.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.640]   Or I can say, play the Beatles.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.320]   The whole point of the sync stuff is the voice recognition.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.320]   And it's spectacular.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.560]   You can say, read me the New York Times front page.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.640]   You can say, of course, I could say,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.880]   call Gina Trapani on her cell.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.960]   It's very high quality voice recognition.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.760]   It really does a great job.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.000]   You can even have it read USMS messages
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   on phones that are equipped to do that.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.960]   Apparently, that's a new Bluetooth standard.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.360]   And not all phones yet support it.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   But with those phones that do, it'll
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.040]   read you your SMS messages.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.400]   The whole point being, it's not legal in 18 states now
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   to hold a phone while you're driving.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.320]   Thank goodness, it should be illegal everywhere.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.120]   It's not legal to text.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.040]   Actually, wait, hold on.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.920]   Hold on.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.520]   I was actually pulled over for holding my phone
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.800]   while I wasn't using it.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.720]   And I got a ticket.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.080]   It's $20.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.400]   And I'm fighting it.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.720]   Because I showed the officer the log that I hadn't been on the phone.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.480]   OK, Maria Shriver.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.920]   But here's the deal.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.200]   He cited the code in California, and I looked it up.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.080]   And it's OK to touch your phone.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.600]   What it's not OK is to use your phone.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.120]   So you could be driving along holding it?
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.880]   Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.280]   Isn't the presumption, though, that you're holding it for a reason?
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.720]   No, I picked it up because it started sliding around the car.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.320]   And I was going around a corner.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.760]   And I was two blocks from home.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.560]   And I just didn't want it to fly around the car.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.800]   It's fair.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.600]   So anyway, in my driveway, I was written a ticket.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.520]   In your driveway?
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.200]   Yes.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.240]   And I showed him the log, and he didn't care.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.760]   And he was like, look, if you keep arguing with me,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.640]   I'm going to write you a ticket for running a stop sign.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   And I said, did I run a stop sign?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.360]   And he said, no, but I'll write you a ticket for it.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.120]   What did you know?
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.840]   You should have had the flip camera going then.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.240]   I know.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.440]   I'm really sure.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   I'm using my phone to get you lose your job.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:51.560]   You do see on YouTube now, you see a lot of video of cop--
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.320]   yeah, malfeasance.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.880]   I think that's exactly--
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.800]   So Leo, one more plug for Ford here.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   I got a press release from them about a week ago
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.240]   that they-- with University of Michigan,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.320]   they're testing, doing a contest for apps
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.360]   that-- in-car connectivity and social networking.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.800]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.280]   Yeah, they've got a guy, Scott Monty,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.520]   who is their social media guy.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.880]   And he's very active in promoting this effect.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.200]   He told me about dial to do.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.680]   I don't know if you guys use dial to do.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.440]   It's amazing.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.680]   It's kind of like Jot was, but it's still free.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.120]   And so on the car, I'll say, call dial to do.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.760]   And then I can do expenses.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.920]   I mean, you can really run your life just driving along
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.400]   and talking to the phone, or talking to the Ford Sync.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.600]   It's just incredible.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.080]   One more thing that we'll move on,
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.720]   and that is they are giving away 15 NANOs and 15 Zunes.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.000]   And it's very easy to participate.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.520]   You can either read up online at their website,
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.720]   SyncMyRidepodcast.com, SyncMyRidepodcast.com,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.360]   or you just tweet to win.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.640]   If you send a tweet, say something like,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   really enjoying this week's twig.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.160]   You can say anything you want, but it'd be nice
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.120]   if you said that.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.640]   And use the hashtag #PoundSyncMyRide podcast.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   You'll be automatically entered into the daily drawing
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.520]   for the NANO or the Zune, your choice.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.720]   So #PoundSyncMyRide podcast.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.840]   Tweet that and get in the drawing for the NANO or the Zune
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.800]   through December 8th.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.000]   And I'm happy to say many of these tweets
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.160]   I'm looking at them mention twit, or twig,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.640]   or one of the twas.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.440]   So give us a little plug when you're doing that.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.640]   And we thank Ford very much for their support
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.880]   of this week in Google.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.520]   1080p for YouTube.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.240]   Boy, I tell you, that's an amazing technological feat.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.480]   I don't even know how they're going to do it.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.880]   We've tried to send 1080p video.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.520]   And you can download a 1080p video.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.720]   Nobody can play it back.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.400]   Are we excited?
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.080]   No, I guess not.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.120]   I'll move on.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.000]   I'm excited only because it means we
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.600]   can do high-def video on YouTube.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.520]   But I guess nobody else cares one bit.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.800]   So there's other sites too that do high-def.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.640]   And I've seen YouTube--
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   Not 1080p though.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.920]   Well, I know.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.000]   But the point is, is that there is a button that I can push.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.920]   But I'm not watching video on my computer from YouTube
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.520]   so that I can watch high-def.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.000]   Like, I didn't come there for that.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.520]   Interesting.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.920]   What did you go there for?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.560]   I came there for crappy video that was some funny, weird thing.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.960]   Like a police officer being recorded on someone's cell phone.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.760]   And who cares if it's high-def?
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.720]   It was taken on a cell phone for God's sakes.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.240]   And so I don't care.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.480]   I have to say, I always press the HQ button if it's there.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.080]   I do too.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.040]   Yeah, I was going to say I always hit the HQ button.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.080]   I like the quality.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.160]   I mean, yeah.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.800]   And I think there's a certain expectation.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.440]   Here's why I'm excited.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.000]   It's TV's in trouble.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.840]   I mean, if you are now able to watch anything you want
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.360]   anytime at high-def, either on your computer
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.560]   or on your screen, through the internet,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.720]   it's got to be tougher and tougher for a television network
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.520]   or a cable company to succeed in this environment.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.040]   I mean, 1080p is amazing.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.320]   I don't know how YouTube's going to do it.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.840]   It also, to me, it shows that Google
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.760]   feels like they're committing to YouTube.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.080]   Schmidt has been saying that it's doing better and better.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.000]   Exactly.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.520]   They're profitable now.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.320]   Chad has been saying they had their best--
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.240]   They actually couldn't work.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.880]   --whatever, even this downturn.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.360]   You don't believe it?
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   I don't believe it.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.080]   Why not?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.120]   I don't buy it.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.320]   I think that it's so expensive to host and play video out.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.200]   And while I think that they are making some money with ads,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.720]   I don't buy the--
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.520]   That was an earlier show, Mary, where we talked about--
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.000]   Sorry.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.760]   --what was it?
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.320]   --on share.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.800]   --tear to peer.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.560]   Are you calling Leo?
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.240]   Oh, no.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.320]   No, it's gone out of my mind.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.360]   Peering, it's called--
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.840]   Peering.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.480]   I think it was the point--
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.720]   It was an exhaust video for Google.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.240]   Right.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   The point being that Google probably
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.640]   doesn't pay for its bandwidth anymore.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.800]   Well, and in that sense, maybe they
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.600]   are closer to breaking even--
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.920]   You don't see a lot of ads.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.240]   And I have to say what ads you see are kind of--
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.800]   you close them right away, don't you?
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.800]   But I mean, I watch all of the TV shows
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.600]   that I watch somehow over my computer.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.640]   We use Hulu.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   We use ProjectRunway.com because we watch that show or lifetime.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.280]   We watch old prisoner videos on--
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.320]   Because the new one's going to come out.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.040]   Yeah, we've got to catch up.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.680]   We're watching that on Hulu.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.960]   I mean, there's--
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:33.440]   I don't know.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.280]   We get Netflix.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.000]   There's Netflix streaming.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.360]   There's-- I don't know.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.200]   There's a whole bunch of different ways.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.560]   Oh, we buy whole shows, whole seasons of shows on iTunes
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.600]   and on Amazon.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.400]   I mean, we just have all these ways to get video that are legal.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.120]   We buy them.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.640]   We watch the ads.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.280]   And actually, all those shows that are being streamed
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   are showing a lot of ads now.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:02.920]   And it's fine.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.280]   It's not overly intrusive.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.480]   It's just about every 10 minutes into the show.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.080]   They stop and they show you one ad.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.680]   I think Hulu wants to do a pay wall.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.520]   Isn't Hulu going to do a pay wall next year?
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:11.920]   I think that was the one.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.240]   They've been threatening that, but that's also
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.160]   part of the news corp conspiracy.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:15.640]   The Fox.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.880]   It's Rupert again.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.400]   Rupert.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.080]   But the point is, is that there are a lot of ways to watch.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.720]   And when I'm doing all that stuff,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.920]   I definitely watch High Def or Good Quality.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.840]   I don't want to watch a whole show that's YouTube quality
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.000]   or some terrible cell phone quality.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.400]   But I actually think that TV programs can figure out
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.520]   a way to do this.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.960]   They're being far, far smarter and doing experimentation
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.200]   a lot earlier in the process of being disintermediated
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.400]   by the web versus print news.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.080]   Or the record industry?
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.240]   Or the record industry.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.480]   I mean, it's just-- it's a huge, huge difference.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.960]   And it feels like they're being very reasonable with me
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.080]   as a user watching this stuff.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.240]   I don't feel overwhelmed.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.120]   I don't feel like it's obnoxious.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.480]   I know they have to make money.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.840]   I'm perfectly happy to either pay or watch ads.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   I just want to be able to get to the stuff whenever
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.640]   I want to get to it.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   And I don't want to know what channel it's on.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.120]   And I don't want to know what time it's on.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.360]   Because it doesn't matter today.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.960]   I just want to watch the show.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.520]   And they're making that possible.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.080]   And I really appreciate it.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.840]   So I feel like they have a chance at doing this.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.800]   You guys agree?
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.040]   That's the future of TV is things like Hulu?
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.320]   Online?
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.600]   Gino?
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   It's certainly where I'm getting more and more of my TV.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.440]   Me too.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:39.960]   Me too.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.760]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.800]   I think that the challenge now is what you--
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.640]   the word you used earlier, which is curation.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.800]   And it's hard to find the new stuff
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.680]   and find the good stuff.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.080]   There's a new site that just started
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.160]   called Click Something, which is another effort to do this.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.960]   I don't know if I can find it in a second here.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.280]   And so I think that that's one of the opportunities you have
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.480]   is to help recommend things, since we're not one size fits
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.880]   all anymore.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.800]   We were talking about curation.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.640]   We have a film crew in here from a website called--
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.120]   eguiders.com.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.360]   And that's the whole idea of it.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:22.000]   It's curation of YouTube and other videos
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.200]   by big name people, movie stars, movie producers, net
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.560]   celebrities, and that kind of thing.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.320]   And it's kind of a neat idea.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.800]   I think curation is really exciting.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.880]   And that's what Twitter really is, is curation to some degree.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.120]   I found it in Flickr.com.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.600]   Clicker.com.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.160]   Jim Lanzon, who was the CEO of--
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   Ask.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:45.680]   Ask Jeeves.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.400]   Ask.com, right?
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.920]   Very good.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.440]   It's his new startup.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.920]   Jeff Paulver tried one earlier a little too soon, I think.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.840]   Andrew Barron is doing kind of a YouTube aggregated--
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.160]   Exactly.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.720]   --play.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.520]   This seems like a very popular thing to do right now.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.800]   But they can't all succeed.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   So it's going to be interesting to see who wins on that.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.640]   Mary, you were saying something?
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160]   We'll catch you.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.400]   I just said that I think the curation piece is really key.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.960]   But I get most of my recommendations for this stuff
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.880]   from Twitter.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   Twitter is curation.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.640]   Two years ago, yeah.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.960]   Dabbel, my company, was actually really almost
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.920]   feature for feature what Andrew is doing.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.120]   I think it was just way too early.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.800]   But I think that the curation, the recommendation piece,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.720]   is really key.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   And but I think Twitter actually does a lot of that for me now.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.080]   Mention Andrew's site, magma, mag.ma.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.720]   But you're right.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.240]   I think in a way all you need is--
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.920]   yeah, it's beautiful interface, but it might be heavy.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.480]   Really, all you need is kind of the stream of text
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.000]   with links in it.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.400]   And you see a few people recommend something.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.440]   And all of a sudden it's like, oh, glee, maybe I'll check that TV
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:48:59.960]   show out.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.520]   It's what I do.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.480]   Where can I find that?
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.240]   Exactly what I did.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.720]   And then I went to Hulu.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.680]   And because Hulu has links everywhere, and I got it.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.560]   And I never would go to any recommender site again
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.720]   to get that particular show.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.800]   Because that's what makes me skeptical about some
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.400]   of the recommender sites for video,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.560]   is that longer video, once you know about a show,
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.000]   you never need to go there again to find loss.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.040]   Or any of the series, you just need
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.440]   the first couple of recommendations where somebody says,
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.360]   oh my god, this is amazing.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.680]   You've got to watch it.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.720]   And then you do.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.080]   And that's it.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   So I don't know.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.800]   So maybe a lighter stream like Twitter
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.000]   that is easy to follow.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.160]   It doesn't take a lot of bandwidth.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.600]   Just follow that.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.440]   Well, you know what you can do is actually tune in.com,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.120]   which is Adam Hertz's new thing.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.640]   He was at Technerati.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.200]   And when I briefly overlapped with him at Technerati
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.160]   five years ago, that's when I got to know him.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.280]   And he's actually doing something now
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.920]   that I think Technerati probably
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.400]   should have done all along, which is,
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.560]   so what he's doing is you take,
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.360]   you throw your Twitter handle into TuneIn,
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.160]   they look at all of your contacts,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.800]   and then they synthesize what media
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.560]   is everybody looking at every day.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.400]   - Interesting.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.920]   - So basically, it could have taken you an hour a day
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.600]   to scan Twitter now and then during the course of the day.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.440]   But instead, you can cheat and you can go to TuneIn.com
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   and you're like, here's what my friends are looking at.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.640]   And if three people looked at Glee,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.040]   maybe I'll go look at Glee or whatever,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.920]   or this New York Times article or whatever it is.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.520]   But it's a really great idea.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.200]   - If I started at Entertainment Weekly today,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.880]   I think it definitely wouldn't be a magazine,
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.360]   it'd probably be Twitter streams.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.840]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.680]   - Wow.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.520]   - Oh man.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.440]   (laughs)
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.640]   That's saying something.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.480]   - Yeah.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.800]   - All right, I have to think about that,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.880]   but we're gonna wrap this up 'cause it's pizza night
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.040]   and we got another show to do,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   and I don't wanna keep everybody here.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   But I gotta point out, Gina's got a mean, cruel sense of humor.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.120]   (laughs)
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.720]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.560]   - Yeah.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.400]   - Oh.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.240]   (laughs)
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.840]   - She booked, marked on our feed.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.520]   Google Street View catches Dutch firetruck
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.040]   knocking down little old lady Gina.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   I am shocked, but it is kind of an amazing use of Street View.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.080]   - It's, I mean, it's remarkable.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.480]   - So I guess the Google,
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.720]   oh, they took the image of the knockdown off.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.760]   - That's interesting.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.360]   You see that this image is no longer available.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.720]   - Well, you know, so there were screenshots of it
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.320]   and it's, you don't actually see the impact.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.040]   So it's possible this woman fell off of her bike.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.480]   - As the firetruck went by.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.680]   She was just, she tried to stop and yeah,
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.360]   we don't know that they knocked her down.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.440]   - Right, and we don't, I mean, hey,
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.600]   the Google Street View truck didn't stop to help her either.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   It doesn't seem like so.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.120]   (laughs)
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.440]   - It's quite a picture.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   I have to say.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.400]   - It is, I mean, I know I have a,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.560]   I do have a dark sense of humor.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.720]   I'm a New Yorker, come on.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.440]   I had to bookmark that.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.720]   (laughs)
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.640]   - I'm not saying anything.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.840]   I just wanted to point that out.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.520]   If you want to see all of the things
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.240]   that are crew bookmarks, unfortunately,
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.520]   we never get to all the stories.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.880]   We do put it on a friend feed room.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.640]   You can go to friendfeed.com/twit-twig.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.600]   You can even comment there if you have something to say.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.160]   And it's a great resource.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.520]   All the stories we've set aside to do for the show
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   are in there.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.800]   It's a great place to go.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.480]   But, time, this show I could do for hours.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.000]   I really could, but we've run out of time.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.520]   So we're gonna finally finish up as we always do.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.360]   Sorry, Mary.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.480]   - We didn't even talk about the new programming language.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.320]   - Go!
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.160]   - Go!
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.000]   - Go!
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.360]   - Go exclamation mark.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.840]   - I hear from an engineering person
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.880]   that there already is a language called Go.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.920]   - There is, and this guy who wrote it is pissed.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.960]   Oh no, he's posted.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.400]   He says, "I'm mad.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.640]   "They should have looked.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.000]   "I wrote Go."
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.800]   - Yeah, and it actually was quite a bit of sympathy
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.360]   I read in the forum thread where he posted that.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.160]   However, Google's kind of a little bit well-known.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.080]   So I have a feeling the name's gonna stay.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.200]   It is, the idea of Go is what?
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.280]   Do you know what does Go do?
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.680]   Why do we need to love the language?
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.640]   - It's super speedy.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.680]   It has lots of the benefits of fast languages.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.040]   Like Python and Ruby, but all the kind of strength
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.880]   of C++.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.880]   - Is it compiled?
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.240]   - It's like a compiled,
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.080]   scripting language or?
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.120]   - Yeah, it's a compiled scripting language,
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.160]   but it compiles apparently extremely, extremely fast.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.120]   The entire language compiles in under 10 seconds.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   It's like 120K lines of code, so I saw.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.960]   - Wow.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.600]   I mean, it looks interesting.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.720]   I haven't played very much with it yet,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.080]   but it's not strongly typed, like Java or C#,
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:53.920]   I wanna say.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   I always get C# and C++ screwed up.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.760]   But it's pretty nerdy for pretty advanced programmers,
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.960]   I think, I think we'll really only see the benefits.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.320]   It's even a little far beyond my purview
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.720]   as a lowly little web developer.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.360]   - It's interesting and it's just part of their speedy.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.200]   - It's part of speedy.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.040]   - You know, move.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.880]   - Yeah.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.760]   - Speedy delivery.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.680]   So if you use Google code,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.160]   you currently use Python, right?
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.000]   - Python and Java.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   - And Java.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.840]   - Yep.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.440]   - Do you become the third language?
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.840]   - That's a good question.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.360]   It seems like, I mean, hey, if they're gonna, you know,
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.480]   if they want it to actually get adopted and people to use it,
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.320]   then they should do that.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.000]   You mean on Google App Engine, right?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.840]   - App Engine, I mean.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.680]   - And Java Python.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.480]   - It's on App Engine, yeah.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.920]   It's interesting to see, I'd like to see you get rolled out.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.120]   I mean, for people to take it seriously.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.920]   It takes a long time to get it for a programming language
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.240]   to really gain traction.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.320]   So. - Yeah.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.320]   - But there hasn't been a new,
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.720]   system-low-oven system language
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.800]   that's come out in a long time
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   and computers have changed a lot.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   And that was kind of their point.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.240]   Like, hey, it's time to, you know, for something new
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.560]   to use what, use the resources we have, so.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.640]   - We also didn't mention that,
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.800]   according to Mike Erington, Chrome OS may come out
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.440]   in its first public beta this week.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.280]   - This week.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.120]   - That's what Erington says.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.400]   Now, he's been wrong about Google before,
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.280]   so, you know, take it with a grain of salt.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.120]   He's not.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.680]   - Take 'em and go buy a machine.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.520]   - Huh?
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.360]   - Put 'em on there.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.200]   - Yeah.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.040]   - Get your netbooks, kids.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.200]   - I'm all Apple, so I've gotta buy a new machine
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.440]   to put 'em on there.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.160]   - It's interesting, 'cause it, in the normal,
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.320]   the normal barrier to writing a new operating system,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.160]   there are two.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.000]   One is supporting the vast amount of hardware out there.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.880]   The other is, you gotta get app writers to write apps for it.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.800]   You can't just deliver an operating system
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.400]   without applications.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.960]   So it's kind of a barrier to entry.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.760]   You can't just come along and be another Windows
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.320]   or another Mac OS.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   What Google's done is that, according to Mike,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.760]   is they've thrown hundreds of developers
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.920]   on the device manager's side,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.760]   and just cranking out device managers.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.400]   And actually, if you think about it,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.160]   they've been in this kind of stealth mode
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.880]   creating applications for it all along.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.960]   They started the other direction.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.920]   They created Google Docs and Gmail,
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.680]   and a bunch of, you know, Google Voice,
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.480]   a bunch of applications that'll run on Google Chrome,
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.760]   perhaps better than they run on other operating systems.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.880]   So maybe in a way, they have a shot at it.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.400]   - Yeah, I mean, Chrome is the browser.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.720]   - It's about the browser.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.560]   - It's gonna be the main algorithm
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.400]   that's the run on this operating system.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.240]   - That's all unique.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.400]   - Yeah, and I mean, it's a Linux build.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.040]   Right, but it's a Linux build, right?
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.920]   I mean, presumably other Linux apps
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   will run on Chrome OS out of the box.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.760]   - Oh, okay.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.840]   - So I understood.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.000]   - But so is Android.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.400]   Why do we need, I don't understand why
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.720]   we need Android and Chrome OS.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.080]   - Right, I see what you're saying.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:28.920]   I see what you're saying.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   - So what are they doing?
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.040]   - I think they just want to run a browser on it.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.760]   Everything else is gonna be in the cloud.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.120]   - It's basically an extension of Chrome.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.200]   A system level browser.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.040]   - It's Chrome with device drivers.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.040]   - That's just hell.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.880]   That'll be the guy.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.120]   - And fast as hell.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.960]   - Yeah.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.280]   - So we need a library.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.920]   All right, I just had to throw those things in
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.760]   'cause you're right, Mary.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.240]   We didn't cover the two big stories of the week.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.720]   But now we have, right?
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.520]   Anything I left out?
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.960]   Before we get to our tool, our number and our tip?
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.800]   No?
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.640]   All right.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.960]   - I think those are the big ones.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.080]   - I'm always afraid, you know,
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.360]   that's one of my great fears now
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.680]   is that we're gonna end the show and I'm going,
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.400]   oh, I forgot that!
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.720]   Gina Tripani, time for your tip of the week.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.040]   - Tip of the week, I'm gonna rip this off
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.000]   from Jeff who bookmarked this in our friend feed room.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.640]   Really easy to get movie showtime information
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.880]   directly in Google right now.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.920]   You put the name of your, the movie you wanna see
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.760]   and your zip code or city.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.680]   And if you click on the showtimes link,
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.600]   you get an in Google list of theaters
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.560]   where it's playing, a map view of how far
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.200]   the theaters are from where you are,
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.400]   reviews kind of all in one place.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.320]   So you really don't have to go to Fandango
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.760]   or movie phone or other sites to--
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.920]   - Oh, for them.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.760]   - Oh, for Fandango.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.520]   - Yeah, oh, for them indeed.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   - So I just click on that.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.120]   - Yeah, just click on that.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.840]   - Pirate Radio 94952 and now there's a listing of times.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.520]   I can get more theaters, I can get reviews,
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.120]   trailers, I, oh boy, oh boy.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.840]   - Oh, one place and there's that map view
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.920]   on the left side.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.640]   - Oh yeah, show map view.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.960]   So you know what's interesting about this?
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.160]   This is in a way, this is kind of a,
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.800]   continues that thesis that you don't need
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.080]   more than a browser.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.440]   You don't need apps.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.000]   You just need the browser and Google.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.200]   - There's a page with what's going on inside now.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   - Right, give me a browser, give me Google
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.600]   and I'm ready to go.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.840]   - If it's a PC but not if it's a mobile device.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.680]   - Or a Mac who still don't have Chrome on that.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.880]   - Well, okay, but I mean like a personal computer
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.360]   I don't mean in the sense of--
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.120]   - Right, no, no, Chrome OS is for a desktop
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.840]   or a network, right?
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.400]   Although Android meets it in the middle
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.800]   because they're putting Android on netbooks too.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.960]   - This is a constant argument between me and Kevin Marks
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.200]   about building for mobile around, you know,
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:49.920]   wanting to build essentially apps that are just a wrapper
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.080]   for, you know, web pages and then having, you know,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   all the telcos and their, you know, poor service basically
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.800]   for internet access, you know, holding you back.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.160]   And you can't have users just sitting around waiting
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.800]   and waiting and waiting for things to load.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.240]   So I think this is really true for when you have some kind
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.440]   of ultimately wired connection or Wi-Fi, you know,
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.520]   regular internet connection but I think anything
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.120]   over a cell network.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.840]   And that may go for little devices as well, not, you know,
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.040]   netbooks that might wanna have internet access
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.320]   through a cell carrier versus Wi-Fi.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.280]   So it gets messy.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.120]   - Yeah.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.760]   Well, I hope you win that argument, Mary Hatter.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.840]   When is, so Kevin, he's works for a telco.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.600]   - I know.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.120]   Well, the argument is, should we do it now or later?
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:46.560]   And I just spent a year and a half developing for mobile
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.840]   where we were trying to do this and it loaded,
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.600]   everything loaded so slowly.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.960]   And because I have both AT&T and T mobile service
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.840]   on different phones, I can compare the phone service
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.440]   and the internet access and, you know, it's bizarre.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.720]   Like you go somewhere and one works and the other doesn't.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.120]   And then you go, you know, 10 miles away
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.680]   and it's the complete opposite.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.080]   And it's not just, you know, internet access,
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.240]   it's phone access.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.440]   And so it, you know, I realized comparing these two
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.600]   phones the last, you know, year, how absolutely, you know,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.480]   this is not a done deal for any kind of mobile thing at all.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.840]   And so you have to kind of build an app.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   - Right.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.480]   That's interesting.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   I do like apps, I have to say. - For now.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.920]   For now, I don't like the idea of windowing a web page
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.160]   in an app.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.240]   I like stand alone.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   - It can be great.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.520]   If it loads fast, it can be seamless.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.440]   - But it's got a load, right?
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.360]   - But yeah, guess what phone services can provide
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.960]   like quick loading, none of them.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.600]   - Right, right.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.800]   I guess it's almost the same argument about cloud computing.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.840]   Really.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.680]   - Similar problem.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.520]   - I'm a little thing.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.560]   - All right, our number of the week from JJ Jarvis.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.120]   - I'm gonna go back to the evil Murdoch empire thing.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.560]   And hit wise says the Wall Street Journal
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.080]   gets 25% of its traffic from Google.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.280]   15% from Google and, well more than that,
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.720]   and 12% from Google News.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.160]   It gets 7% from the drugs report.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.640]   And then it goes down to Yahoo and so on.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.840]   But there's also these evil aggregators
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.320]   like Real Clear Politics and Drudge
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.520]   also send traffic to Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.240]   So this is what he's gonna cut off?
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.000]   - He's gonna cut off Drudge too, doesn't he?
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.960]   In Real Clear Politics, doesn't he?
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.720]   I mean, if you're gonna cut off Jay.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.800]   - Chase Carey, who is the CEO of News Corp,
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.640]   who really does have a mustache to twirl.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.120]   He has an old handlebar mustache.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.400]   Was questioning the way the Wall Street Journal
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.760]   porous wall works.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.400]   If you go to Google and search for something,
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.960]   you can go straight into the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.800]   The reason they do that is because they want the ads.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.560]   They need the, what he all would say, they need the eggs.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.200]   - Sorry, an old reference, nobody will get the answer.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.520]   - They need the eggs.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.120]   The guy walks into a psychiatrist's office, right?
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.960]   - In it, Leo.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.320]   - He says, "My wife thinks she's a chicken."
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.920]   The psychiatrist says, what does he say?
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.080]   He says, "What, what, so she should stop."
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.680]   And he says, "I would, but she needs, we need the eggs."
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.840]   I told it wrong when you get the idea.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.120]   - He falls in the eye cut.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   - Something like that.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.560]   What would the psychiatrist say?
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.520]   I don't know, we'll have to reconstruct that joke.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.160]   So my tool is really more of a tip.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.800]   And in fact, a tip that I probably don't think I would use,
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.160]   if you use Google's safe search, if you got kids at home,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.880]   and you don't want them searching Google for little women
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.600]   and finding little women,
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.320]   you might want to lock your search settings.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.760]   So this is the new safe search lock,
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.600]   which Google introduced this week.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.440]   You go to your search settings,
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.240]   and you can see I use moderate filtering,
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.920]   but if you, 'cause I don't want to see it either, frankly,
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.160]   but if you want to lock your settings,
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.440]   there's a new setting here that applies strict filtering
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.520]   to all searches from this computer.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.920]   You just lock your safe search,
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.480]   you'll assign in with your Google password,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.960]   which is I can't remember, but it's something like this.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.520]   Let's see if that works.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.960]   And then my safe search is locked across the Google.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.800]   - So how is it locked with,
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.640]   is it locked to your login?
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.840]   But how does it lock every search from Google,
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.680]   from that machine?
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.720]   What if you just use a different browser?
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.360]   - Oh, come on.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.200]   Who would do that?
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   - The kids, the kids would do that.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.880]   (laughing)
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.280]   - And now, by the way, I think this is the best reason to do it.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.200]   All your Google searches have big colored balls
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.040]   at the top of them.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.320]   I like that.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.200]   So you're absolutely right.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.280]   It has no utility at all, except it gives you colorful balls
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.480]   at the top of your search.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.880]   And that's why that's my tool of the week.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   You're absolutely right, Mary.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.600]   It's completely useless.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   I don't even know why they did it.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.440]   - So Leo.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.160]   - I use OpenDNS and that blocks everything all the time.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.240]   Yes, Mr. Jar.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.920]   - This guy goes from psychiatrist and says,
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.640]   "Doc, my brother's crazy.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.080]   He thinks he's a chicken."
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.840]   And the doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn him in?"
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.440]   And the guy says, "I would, but..."
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.920]   - We need the eggs!
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.320]   (laughing)
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.160]   - But um...
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:36.520]   You know, let me see if there's an instant rimshot.com.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.680]   - Oh, there's an iPhone app for that.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.720]   - I even get my sound effects from the cloud.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.120]   Instantrimshot.com, please and gentlemen.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.360]   It's also, there's also instant sadtrombone.com,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.160]   but that's only if you tell a bad joke.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.800]   Mary Hodder, thank you for putting up with us.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.040]   We're really glad you came today.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.080]   I'm sorry you didn't bring your persimmon cake with you,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.520]   but that's okay.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.920]   We're glad to have you here.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.440]   You could find her in next time.

[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.840]   that's gonna make you very hungry.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.240]   Gina Trapani, we thank you for being here as well.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.640]   Of course, Gina is the woman in charge.

[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.640]   It is at, I always get it backwards, so you better say it.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.040]   - It's at completewaveguide.com.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.920]   - But it is the complete guide to Google Wave.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.760]   - Yes, but the title, yeah, it's a little confusing.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.560]   - She's German, she puts the guide at the end.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.400]   That's okay.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.240]   - Yeah.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.080]   - Yeah.

[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.120]   - The green room is broken.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.520]   - The dark green room, 'cause it's dark here already.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.160]   - It's nighttime in Brooklyn.

[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.760]   and a wonderful guy to know and follow on Twitter,
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.360]   but you can find his blog at buzzmachine.com.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.440]   And on Twitter, you are...
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.760]   - Jeff Jarvis, no space.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.120]   - At Jeff Jarvis?

[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.240]   - We're so boring.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.560]   - Unoriginal bunch of people.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:45.320]   -
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   (upbeat music)
