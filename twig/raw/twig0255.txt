[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.960]   The Google I/O conference started this morning and lo and behold look who's here?
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.240]   Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani came up over the bridge over the river and through the woods and
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.640]   Over the bridge and over the bridge. We didn't even talk about the bridge going over it. I was flying somebody else drove and it was foggy
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   Oh, did you have a we were chatting or you had wall? No, we had wall. That's great. Love wall
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   Yeah, right. Well, we'll keep you occupied. Yeah, so
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   Welcome first of all. Thank you. Nice to have you in studio. So great to be here
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.800]   We covered it this morning Kevin Marks and covered it and covered it and covered it
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.240]   I started at nine and it went to an almost two and a half hours a very long a keynote
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.400]   Speech and so long and I think a lot of the interesting things were buried in a lot of needless detail
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.200]   But there is some good news for those who went to Google I/O
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.140]   Hardboard this is the gift wait a minute. We should say you did get a certificate good for either an LG G watch or a Samsung
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.600]   Gear live. Yes. Yep, and you're gonna get a Moto 360 whenever that comes out right later this year. Yeah, but you're currently
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.520]   Nothing you got yeah, we that's the only thing we watch watch because I could just take this
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.920]   I'm gonna put it together. It's a little kit if you're really ingenious and smart enough you just take it and there it is
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.080]   it turns into
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840]   Turns into wait a minute. What the hell is that? Okay?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   How you put a phone in there?
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.760]   Well it worked with any smartphone yeah any smartphone has to run Android did you have to install an Android app?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.840]   No, there's a Chrome experiment, which is actually not currently loaded up, but how does it oh so you have to load it on the phone?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.920]   Yeah, you have to load the chrome. Yeah, you know the chrome on the phone. So what's happens is this is a stereo
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.880]   You remember this this is like the view master and you press the thing yeah
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.800]   Instead of a view master you've loaded it with a phone and then watch I'm gonna put it to my eyes and then oh look
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.520]   I see the stars the stars the beautiful wait a minute
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.360]   What's that and if you look at it long enough you get what what's really interesting is just like the oculus rift
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   This moves with your head yeah pretty quickly take that mark Zuckerberg
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400]   Cardboard riff how much did he pay for oculus?
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.960]   four billions
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.000]   Apparently this was a 20% time project with the Google engineers
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.160]   Want to see what they could do with cardboard if you go to g.co
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.920]   cardboard you can see it yourself and even build it yourself if you really wanted to I
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.080]   not to
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.260]   Pull it on only out here genius spent quite a good while in the car figuring it out and I never I had no
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.280]   She was sticking her
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.160]   And then there isn't a
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.560]   I didn't I didn't RTFM at all. I was like I don't I don't care
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.520]   I'm sure that I could just stick the tabs where they need to go. Yes, there aren't but I did less than IKEA style directions
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.480]   Oh Gina Gina made it all figured out and then she went to the then she finally went to the page
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   That's usually how it works virtual reality has made exciting progress over the past several years
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.560]   This really isn't up yours to mark is it is the result is cardboard and no frills enclosure
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.880]   Transforms a phone into a basic VR headset and the accompanying opening open software toolkit
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.280]   You know what this really is a little bit of a takeoff on that thing that the Motorola X does with the hat
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.080]   Yeah, the house allows you it's kind of fun play a game and aim up and down
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.160]   I'm not if we loaded up the hat and stuck it in the car door. It would probably be really cool
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.240]   And it uses the accelerator cooler than this
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.120]   What's that I know they didn't mention that at all
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.440]   Upgrade to two gigabytes, but you have to buy it to give bites a ram and as soon as Jeff saw the watch demo
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.640]   He turned around to me and said getting rid of this point into his glass
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.880]   Two thirds the function out of a more two thirds of the functionality that's right now. Go on
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.640]   Wow
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   Alright, so so there you have it that was that was the big giveaway that I think it's gonna be a little easier to get into Google
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   I/O next year
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.040]   But I said this I said a cool of course you can have trouble with Google I/O
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.040]   We had we had to try like the Dickens to get Gina
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.360]   Thank you
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.880]   But but
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.680]   I think part of that was because they gave away last year
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.400]   They gave away a lot of stuff the year before a lot of stuff and it seems like a good deal to spend
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.560]   What is it nine hundred bucks to get in yeah and get more than that worth the
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.840]   goodies right the pixel was a fifteen hundred dollar machine but for sale on eBay I bought this one
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.940]   I love this one you can make money at it, but I think this is not gonna sell for much
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:09.600]   But then we used to get two watches so I mean you get your choice of the Samsung or the LG and then the Moto later
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.400]   So what which ones do we get did they give any more information about these watches like what they're gonna sell for?
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.160]   Well, fine. Yeah, they said that they would be in sale in the play store this afternoon yet yet
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.080]   So when they go on sale, I guess we'll then know how much it's gonna be but
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.720]   They didn't and say a price and they didn't even say anything more than Moto 360 available sometime this summer
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.960]   Which was right say no, but we did see it is circular right in fact
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   I think soon our patchine was wearing a circular here it is watch the
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.760]   I think it's what 99
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.040]   The gear live will be available for pre-order littered at 199.99
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   So the gear the gear to is 300 bucks LG is 300 is 229. Okay, previously announced. Okay
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   Which one you gonna pick which one should I oh you're asking me like I know I
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.160]   Don't know the difference is I mean see your view I think is the Samsung's been making
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.640]   Or I actually don't I liked the gear to I mean the limit it's limited as though they are I liked it
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.960]   The problem is very Samsung specific device. It may be the case with the effect
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.140]   That's what you should find out. It's probably won't work with your Nexus or your
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.240]   HTC I mean I got the question is Android where so it talks to Android no matter what see that would be great
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.760]   I mean right because yeah, I mean that's that's that's kind of there were some important things today
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.840]   But but and we'll go over them all but going across platform easily was really one of the main points and how
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   The coming together of Android and Chrome and that's how they're going across platforms
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.920]   So that you can have an Android app on your computer your Android app can talk to your watch your watch is sinking with your Android app
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.680]   I mean it really has gotten fairly impressive going across here. Well, I made notes as we talked
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.240]   to
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.680]   to my
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.600]   My energy gave out and I just collapsed in a puddle
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.680]   And we can go through this one by one. They did of course start as every
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.640]   Of these big this is by the way the fourth big company developers keynote we've seen
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   There it started with build Microsoft's build gosh months ago
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.960]   then WWDC Facebook's F8 conference you could throw in the
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   The Amazon phone announcement that wasn't a developer announcement you could throw that in and now
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.240]   Google gets kind of the last word with Google IO
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   This was the longest had the least sales pitch stuff in it and and it's easily the most developer specific stuff way way more specific
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.520]   Than any of the others, but they did begin with a little bit of marketing. They said and right now has one billion
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600]   Monthly active users one billion with a B
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:02.120]   Easily dwarfing iOS has 800 million but only of the 800 million only 600 million our phones
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:09.280]   So but I guess you're including tablets here, too. So a one billion. Well, that was one of the great little swipes ones. It doesn't include
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.560]   Amazon but that wouldn't be very much
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   I
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.800]   Was on is and there were a few very subtle swipes at Amazon and of course and Apple - and Microsoft
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.960]   They never used it. They didn't want to talk about Microsoft
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   But a number of the things are targeted to Microsoft
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   20 billion text messages a day sent over Android
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.640]   Ironically that dwarfs the number of text messages sent over WhatsApp
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   Which is I looked it up, but it was more than I think was 23 billion or more a day
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.240]   So so so as many as they send as many text messages are sent over Android more are sent over WhatsApp
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.020]   So it doesn't dwarf it is the opposite. What's the opposite of dwarfing it? It giants it
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.200]   93 million selfies a day
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.240]   This is not something I would tout. Yeah, no, no, no, and how do they it's an art form?
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   That's gotta be a joke cuz how do you know it's a selfie?
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.960]   What way
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.360]   Which way the camera is pointed, you know, how do you know it's also
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.080]   62% of tablets globally
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:24.480]   That's a big deal cuz the other 38% is iPads. Yeah, yeah, so that I think that's all they didn't have to go in
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.960]   Atoxic hells do or anything like that. They just had to say well, we got a billion monthly active users. What do you got? Yep? Yep?
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.400]   Yep, they did before they announced the L word they announced by the way
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.840]   That's what's gonna be called the L word. I just thought you know
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.760]   You're happy about that
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.920]   No a real L word before they announced that
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.080]   Android one which is a platform an interesting platform looks like a turnkey platform for
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.360]   handset makers in the developing world that allows them to quickly and easily make sub hundred dollar
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:02.600]   With Google services with guaranteed updates with all kinds of things guaranteed updates was
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.120]   And it's appropriate to the markets that you always want. I don't know why in India you always want double sims
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.160]   But you do and radio FM ran in the radio was born in the market and under a hundred dollars
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.360]   I'm surprised they didn't give that away just to say look people look what you can do and it's gonna explode
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.760]   Mobile to left. I mean the big thing today was to me. This is a mobile company
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.360]   It is mobile mobile mobile by the way, they even said that they said we're gonna talk about mobile design it mobile
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.080]   By the way, you can also make up the quaint thing we used to call the web browser
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.800]   It expand nicely for the web as well. Yeah, yeah
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.880]   It was it was do it for mobile. That was that was the whole message of the day to me and play it play supports auto installation
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.240]   A local content so like like so you can distribute these phones with with local relevant apps that will just get auto updated
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.440]   It looks for the scene. It sounded really nice. They they also kind of said in this was a response to toxic
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   Hellstew that the 93% of all Android phones do at least have the latest version of play and
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:05.880]   That they are gonna start distributing security updates via play and doing an end around on the yes on the carriers end
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.840]   Which I said in Twitter
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.440]   That's that's their end around around fragmentation, but somebody else said well, but what what L is bringing
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.840]   That's why updates do matter because there's tons of functionality right and design that comes to L
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.440]   It's not gonna be in a play update. It won't help their places. It's always been a problem
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.480]   It's not that people don't want the latest version of Android is the carriers and manufacturers don't put it on their phones and
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.160]   So you have a hard time getting it and people are not really willing to get a new phone just so they can get the latest version of Android
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.240]   I know
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.800]   The latest version will be L. We know that K is a Kit Kat. Yep J was jelly bean H
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.080]   You know and then on back they're all desserts, so we know it'll be L
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.360]   But we don't know which dessert they haven't announced it leechy
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.680]   licorice so Kevin Marks had an unusual suggestion we heard laughing Taffy
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.080]   Last night said laughing does I thought it was Kevin suggested lintz L. I and DT
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.200]   Yeah, I don't think it'll be lint. No, you know the brand. It doesn't quite fit that brand doesn't quite fit
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.160]   Not quite it's not quite Jason's joke was laughing Taffy. Yeah, I you know, I maybe it may well be given that they made a relationship
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.880]   And I'm sure made some money on Kit Kat making a relationship with Nestle
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   Maybe they'll do the same thing with for L. Maybe and that deal just hasn't closed. That's why we're just calling it L
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.320]   It was lemon heads. I found it strange referring to it as a don't have the little doll ready for the yard
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.600]   I mean, yeah, right the statue hasn't been shipped yet
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.240]   Well, this is one thing they said is we want to let developers look at the new version of Android much earlier from now on
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.360]   So this really is a release or an announcement of an release of an SDK well before the
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.480]   version comes out yeah
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.200]   I mean there's a tremendous amount of design changes here with the material design stuff the new themes
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.160]   This is something that developers want to get ahead of time to get ahead of well
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.880]   Apple announced 4,000 new APIs with iOS 8 now they've got 5,000
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   But I thought a having learned 5,000 new APIs it wasn't a good thing
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.280]   I know it made me feel just kind of tired when I heard that I was a welding I had a long to-do list
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:13.160]   How do you do that when you I mean the each a each new API reflects either a change in the way you interact with an existing
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.720]   service or a new service entirely and
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.720]   Do you just wait till you need something and look it up or do you kind of browse it and say well?
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.240]   Let's see what I can do. I mean this is you can't you don't learn all 5,000 right?
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.560]   No, you don't learn all 5,000
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.600]   I mean it really depends for something like Android where this is a whole new device is a whole new category
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.520]   You want to be ahead of this curve you want when it when these watches hit the market for your app to be awesome on it
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:36.640]   Right?
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.040]   You want your app to be in the demos so that's something that you go ahead of go ahead on and try to learn all the Android
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.240]   Wear APIs and make your app do something special and interesting the rest of the 5,000
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.840]   You know look you have it you have an idea for something you want to build if it's if it's difficult
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.760]   You do some research does this new thing make it easier can I do this?
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.440]   You use it as you need it. Yeah, so you understand the basic outline of what's capable right? Yeah
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:06.720]   And by the way Tim doubt corrects me on Twitter, that's right Apple said 800 million devices sold to date
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.960]   not 800 million active users, so
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.500]   Yeah, I've got a few old I've got a few old unused yeah
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.360]   So a billion monthly active users is a big deal. That's a big deal
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.320]   That's that's Facebook numbers
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:29.700]   They did release SDKs for almost all the new stuff. Yeah, including the L
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.640]   What do they call it the L the L release release L preview?
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.280]   Do you mind if I caught the L word?
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   Not at all
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:47.160]   To mind I'm sorry
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.880]   They they introduced Matthias Duarte who was
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:57.060]   Chilean wearing a shirt pounds to check coat and a paisley shirt
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.400]   Which moirade miserably on camera he's in charge of the look and
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.020]   I'm just saying the beard looked a little like the guy in the Silicon Valley the yeah, Avi at all. Yeah, I
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:18.960]   I'm not sure this is the guy
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:26.160]   You want developing, but it does look nice it does look nice it does call throughout was at great pains to point out that
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.600]   This is kind of what windows phones done the grid
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840]   tiles yeah
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   Things when you tap them move
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.400]   They at first I thought because he said material design
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.080]   I thought what are they gonna change the material they showed a screen and had things up
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.100]   But no, they're just the feeling that something's coming up out. There's an X Y and a Z
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:51.360]   Yeah, there's a Z right so you can have floating like buttons floating on top and and feel and feel distance
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.960]   I didn't ask you but last night on all about Android you all predicted what you think you were gonna see at Google
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.280]   I know how close you think you came. Oh, we did okay. We were on a few things
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.160]   I didn't think Android TV was gonna happen today. We were very pro
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.640]   I thought that the show I thought that they were gonna lead off the show with Android wear and fit right like that seemed like
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.800]   The most interesting things and that was sort of more toward the middle
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.400]   This was an opportunity lost a little bit that they now
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.880]   I understand this is a developer conference and we say that before we do before we did build
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   Before we did WWDC and before this we said look this developer conference
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.240]   This is messaging for developers
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:38.320]   But you do have and as particularly with Google I owe all the press was there there was I we couldn't get anybody to help me on
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.600]   The show because everybody said no no I gotta cover this I gotta be there
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.720]   This is a this is really an important event and I feel like that they didn't do it
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.620]   But a lot of consumer messaging where that that's a little bit of a missed opportunity
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.840]   Yeah, I mean there's definitely a tension right because this is the thing they have to lay the groundwork with the developers
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.920]   I think the developers excited and they have to convince the developers that if they build for this they're gonna make money
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.840]   And they're gonna be successful right before the consumer launch at the consumer launch. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:15.060]   So the consumer launch can be you know can have the apps and have the support for things that consumers want and it's it's tough
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.840]   It's a tough tension
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.440]   I mean I felt there are times when there have been developer conferences where I felt like this was this was obviously should have just been
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.660]   A press event like this is a show for consumers and that that bugs me right because it really is not that I understand that
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.720]   Then don't invite all the press there just says this isn't for you
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.880]   This is a key time
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:39.800]   I think Apple showed at WWDC that you can split the difference that you can you know have a show that's really for developers
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.200]   And of course it's the it's the breakout sessions that come later that are really for developers
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   You could have left a lot of that
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.660]   That especially towards the end in breakout sessions and not you would have shortened the keynote
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:57.840]   And you wouldn't have diluted this message we as it is we have to dig for nuggets in this pile of stuff that yeah
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   And it's a big pile. It's a
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   There's a lot of good material
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.540]   Structured it well enough I don't think they demonstrate I think your point is rightly
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.440]   Oh, they could have demonstrated it more to real people right when they showed how the watch can do this so that
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.200]   Oh, you can you know write an app to call for pizza, right? That's that was cool
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.340]   That speaks to people from his wrist like that's cool. That's cool. So they didn't make it real enough because they had so much material
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.340]   They buried the lead they did
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.680]   But what was the lead?
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.900]   What was it all know our job is I'll tell you in a moment our job is to dig and find the pony in that pile of
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.520]   Information that Google has given us and we will find the pony in just in a little bit
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   Jeff Jarvis nice to have you in studio. Oh, it's a man. I'm so happy
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   I think Mike and Jason Mike Elgin and Jason are on their way back
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.960]   They may have stuck around a little longer than you did
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.160]   But if they do show up, we'll we'll get them on the panel as well
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.100]   I really thought they were gonna say and we're creating with Nest a
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:02.320]   hub for your home and your automation and we're gonna base it on Android home and none of that right
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.120]   But that's good news for smart things if you want to automate your home
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.880]   We've been looking for ages for a way to do this simply to find a hub that will talk you know at home
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.520]   I've got the hue lights. I've got the Sonos
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.760]   I want to get the Schlage door that unlocks autumn
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:26.360]   Automatically I want my curtains to open automatically when the Sun comes up and close when the Sun goes down all of those things and
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:33.280]   Smart things has actually put together a hub that is very very cool. I want to show you this is the smart things hub
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.800]   It is I want to say this was a Kickstarter project. I remember where this was and I actually backed it
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.880]   Yeah, and I and I got the kit and I love it. I can tell you tell us about it
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   And I'll tell you what what they told me to tell you and then you could tell me what you want to tell
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:55.780]   So the hub is the thing that communicates with everything else and it does work across a lot of different platforms
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.760]   GE Schlage I have a list here honey well
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.360]   Ion
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.560]   Nest works absolutely Phillips hue works the wemo which is Belkin's really cool little sensors now
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.480]   You can get a kit and that's probably what you got the basic kit the smart home security kit
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.200]   329 bucks you're gonna get the hub you get a smart sense motion sensor
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.480]   So you could put this in the hallway to know when you you know when you get home
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.240]   Lots of different things you could do with a motion sensor obviously put it in the garage or outside to turn on the lights
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.120]   The smart sense presence sensor, which is kind of a neat thing
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.640]   You could put it on a keychain to let you know when the keys have left the house or on your dog or your cat
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   To let you know when the cat has run away
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.240]   It'll tell you when people our cars arrive and leave your home
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.920]   It can help you where you found your left or left your keys. This is really cool
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.360]   You get one of those as well you also get the multi which is really the most amazing thing
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.420]   It looks a lot like those sensors that you've seen on alarm systems that go on windows and you could certainly use it that way
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.480]   It's a two-piece thing so when you open the window the con connection is broken
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.280]   But this does more than that it's got sensors in here that tell you the temperature
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.320]   It's got an accelerometer. It can alert you if you've left the garage door open it can do all sorts of things
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.400]   So you get this whole kit with this basic smart things kit
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.800]   That'll turn your home into a smart and smart home within minutes because it's very easy to pair
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.760]   You just pull the tab out of the device it all pairs up very automatically
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.520]   No wires to run it all plugs in it's all wireless
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.000]   And there is a growing community over 5,000 developers now or creating new ways to use smart things
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.480]   The the smarter home security kit adds an additional motion sensor a smart power outlet a
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.680]   Siren and strobe alarm and then the smartest kit for 599
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.600]   Gives you all of the all of the stuff I mentioned plus additional present sensor you get a power outlet
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.080]   That's nice
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.880]   You can put a light on there that turns on when you get home and an outdoor light
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.120]   Plug and control power outlet so that's really nice
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.600]   So pick your kit and then use the offer code twit 10 at checkout and you'll get free shipping within the US and 10% off
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.680]   The purchase of any home security kit. So yeah, I remember when this was a Kickstarter project
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.960]   And it was really designed to make this whole process a lot easier. So you yeah
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   Got you excited about I back the project
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.080]   I hadn't done a whole lot of playing around with home automation stuff
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.480]   But it was a friend of a friend and I did the video got me and so I backed the project
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   This is gosh. This is September 2012 a couple of years ago now and I got that one
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.400]   Yeah, and I just I just loved it. It was such a great product that the app was beautiful
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.560]   The things are awesome. I raised a lot of money 1.2 million
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.640]   They raise 1.2 million so I see how far the hub has come that was the original hub. Yeah, and look how nice
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.240]   Small now. Yeah, this is definitely a more polished product. Yeah, but yeah, I had it set up so that my lights came on with a
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.440]   Someone down
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.080]   At night, which was nice. I had the motion doctor hooked up to my mailbox
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.320]   So I got a push notification on my phone when the mail came
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.160]   Sweet works with the Android or iPhone. Yeah, and good our iPhone and and I put the little presence detector on my daughter's
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.560]   Stroller because I just like to know when she went in and out for a walk during the day
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   So I'd be at work and say you know, they kept they got home
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.200]   They left because I don't have a cat
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.760]   And and also the motion detector, you know if yeah
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.920]   We had it on our safe if you have like a gunbox or something if it moves you get a put you get a push
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.320]   Notification, so yeah, it was really fun and really easy to set up and I enjoyed it. I know I
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   It seemed like no, I don't but you know
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:31.940]   Not in the house of my daughter, which is an example
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.760]   We put it on our safe, but not not we don't have a gunbox, but if you did
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.360]   And you had a child well now they're now they're out in the in the public in the world
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.040]   Thanks to people like Gina who helped support the project originally
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.280]   Yeah, and and really this is a refined beautiful project that works so well
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.160]   I'm not gonna show you my welcome code. Yeah, it's a really don't because then you'll get taken over you the other one
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.360]   That's a great product. I really love it. I was excited to see that their sponsor. I have my set at home
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.040]   I'm really excited about the whole idea. I want to get in home automation
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   That's why I was a little disappointed that Google didn't say a word one. Yeah about this
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.360]   I feel like it well, it's gonna be Google or Apple somebody's gonna take step up
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.040]   Maybe it's smart things is gonna step up and just say all right
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.680]   For again, what I'm doing this is everybody make your own stuff and now we can start working across multiple platforms get some
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.120]   Standards maybe right now. You've got these silos. It's not working. Yeah, this doesn't work
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.720]   All right ladies and gentlemen. We're digging. We're gonna there's a pony in here somewhere
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.680]   What do you think of the new I what as he says Mattias started showing the grids and the news on
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.320]   I thought of you immediately thank for most of this
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.800]   I thought of Gina, Japan immediately because I figured you're gonna be our expert on this
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.000]   How different is this one? I do know that one of the complaints I hear people like Andy and not go for years
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.920]   I try to get him using Android phone. He said no
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.480]   It's just not as elegant things don't line up it just feels and it for years Android did feel that way
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.600]   It's a little ill design a little clunky. These new tools are obviously designed to address that
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.520]   does this give the L release a
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:12.280]   Parity with the beautifully designed iPhone you think I think so I think so I was very impressed with the material design stuff
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.240]   And I'm very excited about my app even my app which is just a simple list app and most apps are right
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:23.720]   We're just scrolling down a list. It's gonna make just those just the spacing and the and the nice natural scroll action
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:30.440]   Having that that hover button. I thought I really liked a lot having the sticky headers that that like just just naturally sort of
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.960]   Contract as you scroll up. It looked really beautiful to me
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   And I'm excited about it
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:42.240]   I think that I think that the complaint that Android is just not as pretty or not pretty enough or not as aesthetically pleasing
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.400]   I think that that's that's a done deal. It was kind of a done deal
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.600]   The Mattias started at honeycomb and has slowly gradually moved this to a much better looking. Yes
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.920]   Yes, I think it's been a done deal since a kick cap. Yeah, I agree
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.480]   I agree
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.360]   I mean they show when they show the side-by-side of Gmail the current Gmail with with the new Gmail using the material design
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.740]   I mean it really felt like a breath of fresh air the new the new screen is stuff they could have done before it's
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.600]   aesthetics, but now the paisley helps, you know
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.200]   Okay, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mock him because he did have some odd stuff to wear anyway
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   Well then what was the guy with the black that you couldn't see it with the black t-shirt?
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.680]   Yeah, it was it was a it was a
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.480]   He was a director of Android engineering. Yeah, yeah
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.880]   It was an odd it was an odd shirt to his odd show
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.000]   They all got the odd shirt memo they got the wear the watch memo and the odd shirt
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.400]   They all were wearing smart watches whose screens were blanked so we couldn't really tell what they were using
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.120]   But we but it was obvious it was especially the two women who presented because as always with smart watches
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.560]   With a smaller wrist these things really look clunky. Yeah, and I don't think they were able to dress them up to the point
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   Where they didn't look a little clunky. I was just looking at the LG G site and they try to make them look glamorous
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:04.240]   If you go so they did that at the keynote a little bit there was a shot of somebody leaning up against a pool table being all hipster and stylish
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.760]   wearing the watch
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:12.040]   The one thing I did like about the watch is that it's black until you hold it up and then it goes full color
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.000]   The gear - does that it's always on your - does that yeah?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.760]   But because you don't want to leave the screen all the time because you'll kill the battery
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.880]   So you when you move it when you raise it you turns on right pebble does that here?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.320]   They're trying to make it look glamorous. Oh, yeah, so
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.560]   What is that search for LG G as you'll see you'll see immediately what you'll see the site if you're watching the video
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.280]   What they have videos of this - was the other nightmare here. Let's see. Oh here it is
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   This is what Jeff is talking about
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.760]   First there was the Sun then and this is the phone
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.560]   Search for LG G watch
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.200]   LG G watch so they lead with her style they lead with
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   Yeah, they do that's the interesting thing. Oh it by Android. There we go. So yeah, so I I've got big rings
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.360]   So my watch has to be too
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.600]   You don't know it, but I'm a champion arm wrestler
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   You know that does not look good
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.200]   That really does not look good
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.720]   No, no, it's it looks more awkward on him there there doesn't hurt nerds
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:26.000]   This is the problem with these things they have to be big because they have to have a big battery and of course the screen has to be usable
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   Opportunity for a larger-rusted model. It works well with the MERS. I think don't you?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.200]   It's not a MERS. It's a European carry-all
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.320]   Nice Volkswagen. Love that. Yeah, hmm
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.000]   I'm definitely looking forward to the 360
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   There's some videos
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.560]   Let's finish up with the L word and then we'll get to watch this because that's a big thing too
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.040]   But I want to make sure we get also palette is there's material designer. There's palette
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.080]   That's the the library that you're gonna use polymer polymer, right?
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.920]   polymer what's palette there's another thing
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.920]   I was having an ounce last
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.400]   Last year a polymer but one thing about that library is it also it's cross-platform
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.600]   So it's not just for Android. I can use it with my web design right?
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.800]   Yeah, so the UI can now look kind of you this to me this to me was really crucial
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.760]   And you know what in my field we're starting to think about oh, we don't think about digital about mobile
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.560]   What's really happening there at Google is that they're designing to mobile first
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.080]   And then by the way you can then adapt that to the web you can put things on the web
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   I think that's really really really critical
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.240]   They're proud of the web browser. They're proud of the browser, but they're but when they talk about Chrome
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   They talk about mobile Chrome right they talk about integrating mobile Chrome and they talk about Chrome otherwise
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.720]   They talk about the chrome book
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   They weren't talking about the web
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:54.600]   No, and it was pretty apparent throughout all of this keynote that the hub for all of this is the phone and then you have the phone
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.920]   You have TVs you have laptops you have yes tablets, but the phone is now
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.640]   We used to think of the PC is the hub the phone is the hub and I think what changes
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.520]   the crucial phrase to me in the entire morning was a
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:12.560]   Computer is now small enough to wear on your body all day. Yeah, so they're looking at this as a computer
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.640]   This is a computer is your computer for now and connects to this
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.840]   I think in the long run this will be your primary computer and they'll be they'll be integrated display devices
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.120]   Separately from that right and this is your authentication. This is your communication
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.200]   This is everything you might need a bigger antenna fine. You have this nearby
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.960]   You might need a bigger display you have this nearby, but your computer and your identity is gonna be in this eventually
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.600]   I think yep. Yep. Yep. So polymer is this cross-platform library
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.200]   It's not the first time they've talked about they actually did talk about it last year
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:48.480]   Yes, web components usher in a new era of web development based on encapsulated interoperable custom elements that extend HTML
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.760]   It's yeah, yeah, this is basically a kit for you to build your apps
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:00.040]   All platforms and it's just basically I think we've talked about bootstrap from Twitter
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.960]   This is similar to bootstrap, but it sounds like this is even more even more so
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.600]   You develop okay, you get a bunch of UI elements for free. So on the polymers page
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.920]   It's a polymer project that or you'll see even there's a buttons when you hover over them. They have certain effects
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.480]   They actually do have the material design effects the thing
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.640]   So you'll be able to implement that those things in your app very easily well the more they do of that the more
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.080]   number people can make it
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.240]   Right, right then you can concentrate on your content in your app versus having to style your buttons
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.600]   Right basically, so you get a lot of things are free as a developer
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.120]   It's interesting that they've got this code here on github and not google code
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.640]   Also, they know that's where they're going to where the developers are rather than asking developers to come to them and
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.720]   Yeah, I'm excited about this. I'm definitely gonna play around with this. Look at this playground. This is kind of cool
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.560]   It's a BSC license a little wizzy way
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.440]   You can you can drag it in and you can change the skin and the content and
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:57.960]   Code and here's a map. These are all little widgets. Here's a smoothie chart
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.600]   Here's a speech Mike. I like this idea
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.120]   Put a little mic there that you can click so all of these things
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.800]   There's the smoothie chart. There's the mic
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:15.720]   This is kind of cool, and this is actually web based which really shows the power of the browser these days. Yeah, wow
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.920]   Wow, all right, so palette polymer
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.560]   the L
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   Release a project Volta. This is interesting. That was interesting to you know
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.520]   One of the things Apple got a lot of attention for in iOS 8 is finally they're gonna break down battery use by app
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:37.080]   Google one up them on that battery use hell. We're gonna show you wake states wake locks. We're gonna
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:44.720]   We're gonna give basically. We're gonna instrument instrument everything and you're gonna be able to develop it to see what everything's doing
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.200]   I also worked with shame developers to I mean, you know
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.960]   The protester
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:34:01.640]   The protester there were two protesters by the way like to point out that the
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.120]   Gender distribution among protesters was 50% women
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   So that's nice
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:16.360]   20-28% women attendees but 50%
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.720]   There's that
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.760]   protester one of the protests the second protesters was saying you are all working for
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.240]   a company that makes robots the kill makes robots that kill people
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:37.520]   Does Google have robots that kill people should I be worried actually they bought that Boston company that makes the
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.660]   The killer robots a day killer robots
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:46.000]   They don't make drones and then I guess the first one was protesting
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.320]   Robots don't kill people algorithms
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.240]   Anyway, not a surprise effect
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.960]   We'd heard that and I don't know if you saw this that some of the some of the protesters would be dressed as stormtroopers outside of Moscone
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.720]   He said you see some like I guess I didn't see I just
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.360]   Town has just kept ridiculous not this town. This is petaluma a petaluma that town that town is getting ridiculous
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.480]   Someone on Twitter said that hash we trust Google with our data if they can't even keep somebody out of the keynote
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:25.320]   The protesters a dirty person standing in every single row and they didn't they didn't put your muscle when this happened
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.600]   The blue sky only just stunned white shirts were not authorized to this the blue shirts came in finally
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.720]   They talked to which they didn't know what to do. You know just just do what you do
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   They didn't in fact just squirt them gently out. I'm told they
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.520]   Score to the mouth well at first you thought oh is this is this part of the death like a part of
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.600]   Nobody moved nobody didn't think
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.820]   Famous for his police department, right that they have this whole division
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.080]   Security and police and when they come to your house well when Kevin Rose's
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.000]   Protesters were out. He said when I just called a Google
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.200]   Police were asleep today
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.640]   But I'm glad to hear they're not
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:16.700]   All right, let's talk about Google where cuz I was Android where that was the next topic they did demonstrate the LG G
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.560]   Watch which looked pretty cool. I did
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.000]   I don't want square. I'm with you. I want round. I don't care if it's big round
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.680]   Yeah, I don't care if it's flavor flavor round if they ever make it a small square. Will that work?
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.160]   No, it's not just so it's the shape not this is size
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.040]   I'm wearing a rectangular watch, but I feel like you are yeah
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.720]   It just looks it looks too much like the Cassio was the bezel's big and it just doesn't feel style
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.760]   It doesn't feel it feels like a computer on your wrist, right?
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   The demonstration it looked okay
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:50.600]   It did it did it was very much what we'd seen already in the videos that they showed at the last mention of Android
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   Where was that that we saw that I can't remember?
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.280]   But they have
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.800]   Basically Google now cards in fact, but that is another takeaway the cardification of everything
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.040]   Those cards are now on Chrome the browser when you look at recent on Chrome its cards
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.720]   This is very much a part of material design that those cards should act like cardstock
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:16.520]   float and shuffle and and move and one interesting thing about this - which I think I think was was hidden and important is their
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:23.800]   Prioritizing the cards their prioritizing your notifications all your notifications so that they're recognizing what's most important
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   And I've talked on the show in the past
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:32.320]   Among our more boring moments Marissa Meyer talking years ago about the notion of a hyper personal news stream
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.080]   Oh, yeah, Google will prioritize what you do and actually I think we saw the start of that today
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.240]   In terms of which cards show up and when yes and knowing that this is what a reason interrupt you
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.960]   Yeah, the watch you'll know where you are if it'll know if you're late for your flight
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.320]   It'll know that you walked into the airport. I'll show you your code
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.280]   This is something the phone's done all along, but it's a little more useful the phone is in my pocket
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.640]   I don't see it doing that the watch well the number I forget was 125 times a day
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:01.280]   We check our phones. Yeah, that was the number they gave and so now if it's always on always an hour if you're up all day
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.240]   Yeah, yeah
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.720]   Yeah, which is which is I was teasing Ron last night
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.680]   He installed an app that monitors his cell phone addiction and it it had it attracted
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.840]   He had unlocked his phone 110 times in 24 hours, and I looked at him and said I'm judging you
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   That's a lot and then I heard that
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   One thing that we forgot about about L is some of the notification changes not to not the rewind
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.360]   But the the notification is now will be in your lock screen and L which is really nice
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.600]   you know looking like a card looking like a car light swipe them way yep and
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   An L will run exclusively on art as well, so there'll be a lot faster
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.360]   We didn't mention we didn't so Dalvik which is the just-in-time
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:51.240]   Java compile and runtime I should say that is used currently on Android we saw art when Kicap first came out you can turn on your developer of
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Preferences and go in there and and switch to art it had to recompile all the apps
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.320]   So it was a fairly long switch over right work. You said you had problems with one app
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.920]   I remember Ron actually switch over to art and like crashes whole machine
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.720]   It's because what's app actually had wasn't wasn't compatible with art which I'm sure it is now
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.440]   But L is exclusively an art which just means it's a lot faster a lot smoother and that's and that's in developers
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.080]   Don't have to change anything from their apps to get that speed increase
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   They said two times speed increase over Dalvik a better garbage. I didn't notice that with the pre-release art
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:28.120]   Yeah, but and I have been using art right because you switched over and you've
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.880]   Been there since yeah, you've been artified ever since artify ever since once you go art you don't ever go back
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.400]   And that's fully that 64 bit compatibility which just means a lot increased memory space
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.300]   You just just get get a lot more memory and speed for now because a just-in-time compiler which means it doesn't
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:51.540]   So the way all of these work is that the code sits there, but right before it's used it's turned into a
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:58.920]   Sam machine code that they or maybe just the Java. No, I guess the machine. I don't know turn into something that the machine could run
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.800]   Art is in ahead of time
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   Right so presumably goes through the apps and kind of pre-compiles the apps right right because when you compile a job
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.720]   You actually get bytecode versus machine language
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   That's why you have a job of runtime that then it then it then translates it into machine code and so
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.320]   Right art is just doing that faster. So it takes the
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:28.280]   the non machine specific decks code and turns it into machine specific code that would be run instantly right on your device
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:36.160]   Things would go faster when that happens. I didn't mean to take us out of our better garbage collection to better garbage collection
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   I'm all about better
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.560]   I know everybody's on the edge of their seat hoping that they were gonna get better garbage collectors today and we did
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.360]   Well, it not only is a garment
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.880]   Collector, but apparently it's gonna be a garbage compactor
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.520]   And I always wanted one of those I like my garbage compacted. Um, there will be garbage compaction
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:10.760]   Anyway art is gonna be on L compost code. Yeah compost code. It's recycling not throwing out your bad memory pointers
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   Alright
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.400]   So sorry
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   In there
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.080]   Well, so we okay
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:31.520]   There is an SDK available today, that's a free release or is it the refinal SDK?
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.800]   I think it's the final man. They're close because we're gonna we're already
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.320]   Yeah, it's maybe this final
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:45.120]   So what do they show they showed step by instructions instructions for all the cooks or if you're cooking and you got your watch on
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.560]   You can swipe through and look look at the stuff that you're working on, which is nice
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.720]   I've had I've definitely splashed some tomato sauce on my iPad and had my phone lock on my hands or wet while I was cooking
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.960]   Order a pizza from e24 right from your watch
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.040]   When's it that way you can order the pizza and spill the tomato sauce
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:08.120]   If you're a pizza cook uses it um they had order hey Google order me a car right lift just
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.680]   Wake me up tomorrow a lot of voice
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.600]   the
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   Again back to the to the cards being prioritized so you can watch me the the key to me is that
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.520]   This is now completely obsolete it because I've always said
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.240]   To is Google glass
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.880]   This has three functions right the Google glass
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.080]   The one thing that's not obsolete it so far is the being able to take a picture of what you see when you see it and share it
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   the two things that are obsolete it are alerts and
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.480]   instructions
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.760]   And the watch takes that over and does a better job of it right I can just get a glance of whatever alerts
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.160]   I have I do not want the alerts coming in here. I've learned that
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:58.080]   It doesn't prioritize well enough. It can't figure it out. It's worthless and in terms of instructions
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.680]   um
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.600]   I'm either going to use if I'm in the car and I'm driving I'm going to use my actual phone as my GPS
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.680]   If I'm walking
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.000]   This is kind of dumb and I'm going to walk into a post
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.120]   Turn left jeff on the watch works well
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.480]   So the big use case you're missing though going from the glass to the watches of his video is hand
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   You know hands free video and taking pictures, right?
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.200]   That's what I'm saying
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.640]   Yeah, that's the thing that stays with us
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:20.880]   Right
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.800]   But it's fairly not necessarily the google gear or I'm sorry this samson gear too has a camera
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.560]   Yeah, but that's you could say take a picture. It's actually pretty good camera. She wants to ridiculous
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.920]   It's no more ridiculous than using your glass
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.440]   No, this is the point that the gene
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.600]   Jeana has some nerves saying it's ridiculous when jina is looking at edda
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.640]   Yeah, yeah
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   Yeah, hey edda do that again
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.760]   Yeah, all right
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.360]   Hey edda here's mommy you know
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.320]   Right hands free
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   Yeah, but here's where this goes
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:48.880]   Here's where this goes
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.960]   That there's a particular use cases, but I mean, you know
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.760]   Class becomes there there's a camera that will be here
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.520]   No one, number two it will have an indicator on to know when it's on to get rid of all this privacy
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.720]   Mining, right and then number three it'll be a hell of a lot smaller and just be able to communicate with your phone
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.440]   So I went zip lining with the gear to watch
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.840]   I had a GoPro and you're right for the video and so forth the GoPro
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.000]   But just having the you can't really carry a camera when you're zip lining because your hands are busy
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.240]   These are not bad pictures
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.240]   My hands would be so sweaty
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.920]   Those are quite good. Those are much better than I would have expected. Yeah, I was actually somewhat pleased. I thought they came out quite well
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.400]   um, so
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.480]   Okay, so
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.560]   That's by the way, there's no reason to say that a
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   Android Wear watch wouldn't have a camera. That's true. That's true
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.040]   One of the maybe you will maybe you'll keep the class because so you can take pictures of that
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.440]   Yeah, you know, you just don't get that, you know
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.720]   Blink to take a picture or just you know take a video now
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:54.400]   You're actually right and that's really not something you want to you know
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.120]   You don't want to do that unless you're on a zip line or you're you know
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.760]   You're your daughters about to take her first steps right there. They're kind of special
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.400]   It needs to be in a certain place. Yeah, not a bar. Hey, okay back to the L word
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.640]   I'm sorry one more thing. I just noticed somebody tweeted me
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.120]   The guy who wrote the google developers blog on material is nicholas jikkoff alcore the guy who did
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.400]   quick silver for the mac and torsion disappeared from the quick
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.240]   Google that's right
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.640]   Google and now we know what he's been working on which is
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.560]   Material design
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.120]   So that's pretty cool. That is pretty cool. I still use and love quick silver. I do too very well designed
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   Do too and he has a pretty good post
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   about
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.240]   material design what it means and how it integrates with the
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.080]   Polymer the toolkit for the web which basically gives you access to material design in web browser
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.480]   So sorry about that. So back back to the wearables
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:48.320]   I think another important thing about wearables is context and how the wearable both senses it and creates it
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.120]   Right it creates context in the sense that when I when I
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.400]   I'm worried by watching I'm holding my phone my phone says i'm okay to be unlocked now. Mm-hmm hallelujah
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.720]   um
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.960]   I did like that. That's a nice. Yeah, I just take it from the motor. Nice which senses bluetooth
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.920]   bearings and will unlock if you're on a secure bluetooth
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.480]   And I sense there's a there's a whole list of of contexts that work both ways right my watch will know where I am
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.280]   Nearport. I've got to tell you to go to the flight. I'll prioritize that that card or
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   I watch creates the context of saying jeff's near here because it's his watch
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.880]   This is great and
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.440]   This is something we've already seen nibbling the edges around moto x knows when you're home knows when you're at work
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.240]   Uh, there's a program we've recommended called agent does the same thing on any android device
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.200]   It makes sense when you're at the store reminders have always popped up saying don't forget to buy milk
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.520]   But it makes sense to watch this is a better place to put it is on your wrist. Yeah, so this becomes your authentication in the future
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.240]   I think which is which is important. Uh, that's very interesting
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.160]   That's so that for what for for all these kinds of things we're walking into your house for
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.840]   We're getting to your lock the devices for for um billing things
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.400]   if you're wearing it
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.040]   Presumptly you're gonna less likely to lose it
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   And by the way, if you lose this
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.280]   If these two things aren't near each other you're for watching your phone to watch that each is going to say, oh, I'm really
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.920]   I'm not going to work right here. The gear 2 does that as well
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.680]   It not only notifies your relief, but you can search for your phone by pressing a button on your watch
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.000]   And the phone will be or pressing a button on the phone and the watch will be so so
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.360]   Again, I feel like as sam sung has is kind of
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:30.320]   With his second generation watch kind of seeing the opportunities and these are obvious opportunities to anybody's making these devices
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.000]   It makes sense that it should be in an API for android wear
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.760]   Um
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.160]   We still have an answer to the question of which you should get the gear
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.240]   No, I was like, where did she?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.880]   So this ham sung what's it called the gear line?
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.560]   Gear line. So you're live. I mean
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:50.240]   My take on it was I want the one that's more stylish because maybe i'm just vain and to me that's the that the g watch
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:50.720]   I don't know
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.080]   Look at people's risks carefully as they were on stage because I think every one of those watches
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.520]   Was was well?
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.240]   Suh-dong was wearing the stage. He was wearing the round when it looked a lot better
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.440]   I agree
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.800]   Actually, they looked big on him. I mean it looked like a chunky watch on him
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.840]   I don't mind chunky watches so much. Um, it definitely made me want the the moto the most
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.560]   But between the g-watch and the and the gear live I I like the way the g-watch looks a little better
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.160]   But I also like that sam-sung has some has some experience with watches
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.920]   So see that has a live preview as a preview up of the gear live
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.320]   Uh, okay. Let me find that because we you know, sam-sung doesn't have any information up
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.200]   Um, this looks a little bit nicer frankly
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.520]   Um, this is the heart rate monitor the cooling about this one is the heart rate monitor
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.280]   No, I gotta tell you don't get overexcited because these heart rate monitors on wrist watches
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.600]   I've have a of a basis in the gear to sorry a best buy ad before we get to the
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.560]   Uh, review, but they don't work. They don't work when you're moving for one thing
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   So they're not really ideal for x-u-s
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.440]   Well for me because i'm stationary most. Oh, that's good if you're sitting around they're the best
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.920]   Uh, um, so yeah, the gear 2 does it and so does the basis watch and they're they're accurate in the right circumstances
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.240]   Don't get too sweaty. Don't move around too much. Uh, they don't work very well in
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.720]   Um, but I do think these replace the fitbit and the fuel band and all of these simply simple pedometers
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.320]   Yeah, so here here is the scott stein and a senior editor and that is the sam-sung gear live
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.480]   Looks very I have to say almost identical minus the camera
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:25.360]   Uh and the button to the gear gear 2 it does read messages respond by voice. You can do that in the gear 2
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.720]   Um, they're big, but you want a big screen because you want to be able to read that's true too. Um
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.680]   Also the charging situation on these things
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.200]   Uh, I can tell you on the gear 2 that you have to dock it
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.280]   Uh, and I think it's going to be the same here. This looks on the back identical
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.880]   Well, how do you dock it? Well, I'll show you see what look at when he shows you the back
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.640]   Yeah, you see um, you see there's contacts here. There's four contacts
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.040]   This is just like the gear 2. It has a little it's not too big little dock that slips onto it
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.920]   And then that has the usb port just put a usb port in it. They did say wireless charging
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.440]   Should be wireless. It should be wireless. I don't I don't think it should make a watch of the dock or usb
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.840]   I mean, I just think what I wear my watch at night so I can see what time it is because I'm blind
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.480]   If I have to take my watch off every night to charge it
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.040]   Yeah, I think you're gonna have to and if you want to use it as an alarm
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:20.320]   All right, let's look at all you know you tell your phone to be right the phone. It has to be alarm, right?
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.280]   All right, I dock my phone right next to my bed
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:29.520]   All right, the the g I think the lg is the one I would get really yeah, you're gonna get the moto, right? So
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:38.080]   Just because lg at least has a page up. Let's see if we can uh, find out more about the g watch choice of colors in black
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.040]   Titan or white gold you can customize the strap boy. That's a big
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.000]   I mean, I think from a distance they look identical 400 milliamp hour battery
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.880]   Uh, it says it'll go all day in a single turn this is this is a luigi moment here. Um
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.480]   It's like the flop. It's a computer on your wrist
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.440]   And it's going six hundred miles an hour. Yeah, exactly and there's a toilet
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.000]   Right. So that's all you need to know. It really is. It's this come on. This is pretty damn
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Here you go. It is. It's pretty amazing. This will work the g watch and I'm sure this is true of the sam sum
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.200]   But I can't promise you but the lg will work with any smartphone running android 4.3 or better
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.600]   By the way 4.3 is a recent
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.560]   4.4 is the current right? Yeah, 4.4 just came down on ours. Yeah, kickettes current before three jelly beans jelly beans
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.640]   Okay, that's that's not the most recent. Yeah, you're right. I was doing having a luigi out
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   Well, it doesn't have boys charging it's crap
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.080]   What do you mean? I have to plug it in
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.320]   If you go to um gee that we had to wind them
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.720]   Get a change the date in them and the little tiny thing there
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.520]   I knew somebody used to have
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.160]   In fact, I have quite a few these what this are called automatic watches that wine is you walk us
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.760]   And he had a device
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:57.360]   Because if you didn't walk enough he'd had device you put the watch on it spins it around in a weird way and winds it up
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.760]   Because if it were your gates, yeah, yeah
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:05.840]   That's lazy. Wow. I think I think the rational just is that if you're a collector
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.800]   Okay
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.360]   So here this is a little this is a little
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.440]   Recursive I went to g.co/warecheck to see if
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.000]   My phone is compatible with android where and it refers me to g.co/warecheck
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.160]   So maybe the phone the page isn't done yet. I don't know
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.960]   um
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.200]   Anyway
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.800]   Um
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:34.320]   This is this basically combines the features of
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.480]   um
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.840]   the pebble
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.120]   With a with a you know fitness band of some kind
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.800]   Uh google now notifications. I think this is do they all have the fitness stuff? They all have the same sense or imagine
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   I mean those those are easy to implement. Yeah
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.520]   So
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.320]   Little star heart rate only available on watches with heart rate monitor. So really
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.520]   Interesting. I wonder what that means
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.920]   Uh
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.600]   All right now they're also gonna then but this is a good actually you know
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.520]   This is a good page if you go to android.com because it really demonstrates what the future vandored is powering screens of
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.160]   All sizes right it was android on every screen. We felt like the thesis today
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.840]   Android where on your watch and everywhere in the world android tv android honor
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:28.960]   Yeah, so android is the future and that makes sense when uh, andy rubin left to go run robots
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:35.600]   At google and soon dark pachai took over he's the chrome guy the crumles guy all of a sudden we suspect
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.560]   Maybe this means there's going to be some sort of unification and I think that's what that's what's happened
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.600]   Everywhere and and that makes sense from a google's point of view. They've they've got a great product
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   They do and they want the next billion people and I think that they have a shot to get in the next billion people online with this
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.280]   Especially the phone that costs less than $100 auto. I don't know. Well, how much there is to say about auto. It's a casting
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.760]   Thing which is also what uh apple's car play is the
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:08.160]   Auto does not have android built into the auto anymore that has iOS built which i prefer because I don't want to have to say
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.120]   I don't want to buy this car because literally if if a car came only with iOS, I wouldn't buy it
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.480]   Well in five years you don't want to be looking at your car saying gee you're still kit cat. I wish you were the L word
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.880]   Um
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.360]   I say that all it's a w word at that way w right who knows what dessert will be at by then
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:30.320]   Um, so but it the way they demoed it with that cut down soul kia soul
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   Uh was cable and I think that makes sense. You cannot get a full screen like this fast enough with bluetooth
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.400]   So you're gonna have to connect a special cable so your car will have to have it
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.840]   They did say that there are a lot of cars in this alliance a lot of manufacturers. There's a word no, taiota
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.800]   Yeah, I thought that was odd. Did you see honda? I didn't see honda if you go throw on the page
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.880]   So yes, honda's there honda's there i think that here's the list. Let's wait wait a barth
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:01.200]   A barth. I love the a barth. It has a scorpion for the logo. So that's gotta be good
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.920]   Uh Bentley too, so you gotta be happy about that
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   Acura outy
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:13.600]   Ford honda honday infinity jeep kia
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.880]   Mazda mitzubishi nissan opel
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:26.000]   There's still opus you're filmed with gm and your first car was an opel cadet. Oh, no, really you're a dork
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.160]   ram rino seat seyat i'm sorry seyat
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.520]   Skoda
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.480]   Subaru Suzuki vox vagan and vo
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.040]   Vaux so what's missing from that? Uh, well as you said toyota is the big one tesla's not so
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.040]   Tesla's not there
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.960]   Yeah, but gm in the in the in the guys of chevra le but not other well i guess there's christmas all right
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:57.040]   So gm and four they got the big auto big three us auto makers. They've got vaux swag and outy. That's good
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.000]   So these in other words big. I don't see i don't see puzhou or rino. Well, there's rino
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   See tran
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   I want to do chavur with android vaux auto
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.080]   um
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.520]   But I like I think I like the idea now kevin marks was unhappy with
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.400]   The screen he said why would they waste space at the bottom of the screen for those icons?
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.960]   On a 16 9 screen. They should put them on the left
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:30.720]   I think that's pretty standard. I think that's what people expect in a car and remember you're listening to the directions not watching them on the screen
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.800]   Right
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:37.600]   Touching than I would on the music there was far more touching. That's gonna. That's gonna get a lot of torture
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:44.240]   Out there because there's there's you know now we have the feds wanting to regulate phone gps
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:50.480]   So they're gonna come into this too and they're gonna regulate anything you do in a car that but I have to say I at least on my phones
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   I'm able to use google
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.560]   Uh speech to say listen to lana del rea and it will play music
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:03.440]   I could say launch audible. It will launch the audible app. I think most of what we do can be done by a voice
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.120]   Yeah
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   I think until you're in the app
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.240]   Yeah, once you're in the app you can't navigate you have to yeah, but they but they have written you know the directions app
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:19.360]   Uh and messaging apps to be able to work. So that'll be the next phase. I think it's a big app partner spotify stitcher umano
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:24.560]   Uh pandora iHeart radio songs a major league baseball
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:30.320]   Um, so that they've got app partners. Um and in the demo, you know, he did the okay google
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.680]   What time is the museum open till and then google responded and then he said what can you take me there navigate to there?
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   And so you have that a conversational google
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:43.040]   Um search voice search going on which I was like, okay that was impressed by that
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.640]   They also showed that on the watch by the way. So yes, you could actually lose the watch to a steer around
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.680]   Um, anyway, this makes sense and that's is I guess what?
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.840]   Google saying is we're agnostic you you could have android everywhere
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.200]   Yes, you can wear it. You can put it on your tv. Let's talk a little bit about the tv
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.320]   I wasn't exactly sure how this worked. I'm not either
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:10.080]   Uh, the I gathered that sony and sharp will announce 4k tv's later this year that will have android tv built in
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.080]   But more importantly this I got the sense will work with crumb cast
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.840]   Yes, well, but you can cast from your anything that's that's cast compatible
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.160]   So any tab on your computer or any app on your phone that has the cast button will cast to android
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   It separated google cast from chrome cast where I could even cast my entire android interface. Yes
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.840]   Yes, you can cast your street right you can cast your screen, but that's to chrome cast
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:40.880]   There's a separation here between android tv and chrome. I think google cast is the is the casting technology
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.600]   Right the google cast is the is right is the is the technology right but but to say that something's a google
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.160]   I think they're using the term cast ready apps
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:54.560]   I think just means that you can stream out the media to either chrome cast but also android tv
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.200]   It also looked like they were going to have a lean or we're going to encourage a lean back
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:05.760]   Experience for apps so that if I cast the app to a 10 foot screen a screen 10 feet away
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.920]   It would have a lean back interface
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.160]   Right so right now the way chrome cast works the interface is always on the phone on the tablet
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.040]   And not on the screen the screen just hits the content
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.000]   It looks like I will be able to control the screen from the phone and have an interface
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.040]   So I could search Netflix on the screen, but use the phone. I'm not sure but exactly how that's going to work
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.960]   It's not clear. Yeah, tell me if i'm wrong, but this is important. They did not make a box
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.120]   They did not make a brown globe
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:36.640]   So that means they have a very limited installed pool of two manufacturers both japanese not
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:41.840]   korean's by the way who are the big ones? Well, you're not gonna see samson because they have their own platform exactly
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.200]   So ah this this is the one that underwells me most
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:52.480]   I've google struggled in tv, you know, they did the google tv which was arguably a flop even though lg adopted it
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.320]   A korean company now they're going to do the same thing now. They have to do the manufacturers
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.720]   And so if I wanted tomorrow across all my tbs in my house and I have many I don't think that's that play
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.800]   I think that's a possible one, but I think chrome cast is the play and if they can use chrome
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.040]   But all that functionality leon, not so sure all that functionality they showed you I don't think came with chrome cast
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.480]   All that lean back and control the tv and do the search the search interface and the
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.800]   No, no, that's not. I felt like that was unclear. No, but you were sitting in the room and you
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.440]   It was unclear. No, you're right this they kind of breezed over
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.080]   Chromecast was a whole separate thing. This was for for a google tv at android tv rather
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.240]   Yeah, this is yeah, that was my question mark. I didn't understand exactly what did what but I think that's the case
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:40.480]   So they they hope obviously to get manufacturers to adopt this build it in the set-top boxes
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.760]   Build it into tv's but that's a big get
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.320]   And and and now once you're there the interface was fascinating too because it really brought search
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.680]   And I don't want to necessarily look for just you know, give me the
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.560]   Academy award-winning movies in 2012 I could care less but
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.600]   um
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.920]   The fact that I can browse through choices rather than through schedules that I can ask for a show and get a show
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.360]   Right, that's a search motif brought to entertainment. That's important, but not if you don't have an installed base. It's not
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.200]   Right. Well and furthermore when he did the search
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.640]   He searched for Breaking Bad, which I know is available on Netflix. Yeah, Amazon
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:25.600]   Uh, and it only showed google play store. Right. I do hope that that search will not be cross
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.440]   Provider well, I mean, I hope it fires is not by the way
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.880]   They fire tv when you do a search it shows it on amazon and it's not anywhere else
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.040]   And that's really what we want isn't it is across
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   Right content. I think they said there would show anything you have installed. Okay, that would be good
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.800]   So if you had Netflix installed and it was available there, I think they said does that sound
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.840]   When nephlics have to expose that to them like that. Yes, it's possible that nephlics would have to expose their
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.400]   Right. How would you search it?
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.280]   Right. Yeah, I'm confusing a couple of different things
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.080]   Because the research the tivo does that so when I search on my tivo it does it cross
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.200]   Uh hulu plus amazon Netflix
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:11.760]   Yeah, and it will show and my infinity on demand as a matter of fact and it will show where those shows are live on all of those platforms
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.080]   It seems like that's the only reason we'll answer that's what you want. Yeah, so I'm looking at the developers page designing for tv smart tv's
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.560]   powered by android
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.200]   Okay, so that tells you that that is some something you're gonna build in bring your favorite android apps
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   To the best screen in your house
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:35.120]   Thousands of apps are already optimized for tv's. This is how google tv worked you'd install an app on that was for google tv on the tv
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.040]   Um, and then for developers had optimize your layouts for tv screen
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.480]   I did love it that when he was showing the android device. It showed it in portrait mode
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.880]   And then he's turned the phone
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:55.600]   To show a dark sky or whatever and it went to widescreen and what's a landscape? Yeah, that's what it should do
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.360]   And that's nice. Yeah, so the sdk provides fragments, which is android speak developer speak for
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.560]   ui elements that would that that make your app sort of tv compatible
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:14.640]   So it sounds like this this preview sdk sdk let's you provide layouts for the tv if someone puts your app on the tv and also
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:21.360]   Expose your content to the search results as well. Okay, you've got you got media in your app
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:21.840]   Yeah, yeah
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.600]   So yeah help users find your content quickly with in app searching great in app searching
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:32.720]   That's nice and he was using a game controller on the tv. That's also built into android tv is a sport for game controllers. That's nice
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.400]   in twitter ben's one says that aces and raiser are making android tv set top boxes
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.960]   Yeah, he did mention
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   Raiser aces is something
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.680]   So um the api comes out to or the sdk comes out tomorrow if you want to uh
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.960]   You want to start developing for tv and i would i would hope we get some clarification maybe
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:59.360]   At this point i google's have developers have to feel sort of burned by the original google tv
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.280]   By well, I mean the q q we never really had a chance to develop for
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.400]   um
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:10.320]   Chromecast has been a success and that's you know, but it's been a slow, you know apps have been have been adding chromecast support slowly
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.240]   You know, this is the kind of thing i'd love to see this capability through the chromecast
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.000]   Because that would basically enable any tv to do it. It's a better way to do it
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.560]   I don't know right like if all this functionality was built into existing chromecast devices and yeah, now it's true
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   It's true. I'd love to see that too. Um it is a sarah prez writing
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.840]   at tech crunch says that this will
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:36.160]   Uh update the chrome to the chromecast will introduce an airplay like android mirroring feature photo backdrops. I liked those
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.520]   Yeah, that was really nice. You can have your weather now. You can have a variety of photos
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.680]   Right. So this is chromecast specific update
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.000]   The the the nice thing about the about the marriage between android tv and chromecast and they made this point like as cast
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.720]   Chromecast gets better as that as casting gets better as they get better at memory and and speeding it up
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.600]   That will also improve android tv, which is nice
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.520]   Um, the chromecast updates were awesome
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.000]   So you can put your own pictures as the backdrop is really nice so you can mirror your screen
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.680]   Which is also really cool
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.720]   I the fact that you don't have to be on the same wi-fi network
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.880]   Yeah, google is going to mediate that which is kind of cool
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.480]   That's very cool. My my dream route to bat is is every hotel room in america should in the world should have a chromecast
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.360]   Right, so you walk in the room and you just send
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   You know that was one of the reasons you didn't bring your chromecast do it because life is the wi-fi would be all
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.520]   But you don't need to anymore bring your chromecast with you if you can plug in at any hdmi port
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.680]   You can now use it but google would be very smart to do a deal with a hotel chain
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.440]   They don't need to because it's so progress is so big bring your chromecast
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   Oh, japan saying that each every tv should have it
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:50.160]   What does this remind you of I this immediately I made me think about that axis q this felt like echoes of the q
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.920]   I remember that feature with q where you know if your friends came over the android devices
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.000]   They also could send their playlists to the q which is idea of like social flinging
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.240]   Social flinging
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.600]   Digital flinging. Yeah, um and i was like, oh, right? Okay. The q kind of lives on a little bit and
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.400]   Well, that was a really good point you made in twitter jina that you you see the
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.640]   Aniseedence the absence the descendants of the dead
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.160]   Yes, yes come back alive and the best ideas and they really do use things from wave things from q
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.480]   Yeah drive and so many wave things right you see that see that the social thing from q
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.360]   You know you saw so many of the things that failed in buzz have showed up in google plus although I
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.440]   Admit that google plus hasn't been the most successful or it certainly didn't have the spotlight
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:41.680]   Yeah, but yeah, I mean google's google's failures are public, but they obviously inform the next generation
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.520]   Um, it's a lot of folks kind of snarking on twitter was like, oh, what about this?
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.600]   You know, what about glass what about google plus and everything they talked about last year doesn't exist this year
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.800]   And I think that sort of the ghosts of the of the of the old stuff that didn't work. I think really inform the new work
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.080]   I like that
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.560]   Um, it's just it's a it's messy. It's evolution
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.160]   Versus, you know the big reveal of the perfectly polished product
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.840]   But this is how the real world works
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   Yes, and you're gonna get a better product if you try it in a variety of ways and
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:15.200]   I'm at least google continues to try it and that and it's a startup world startups fail things fail
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.560]   It's a company of many startups and they're not embarrassed to say hey that you know
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.480]   We're never gonna sell the queue, you know, and I think it's all forgiven when you have cardboard
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.200]   I love cardboard
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.520]   You think this is a little bit of a knock on the oculus rift. The fact that hey, we're gonna give you some cardboard
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.160]   Yeah, and it does exactly the same thing only better not only that
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.840]   I mean also a knock on amazon because who needs 3d in your phone? We get you know, they're right there is a little bit of both
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.920]   It contains magnets
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.360]   There's a magnet. Yeah, there's a magnet. We're not clear on why that magnet is there. I don't know it must um anchor the
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.880]   Film where's that? Yeah, a rubber band the magnet and some some glue
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:02.240]   Yeah, it's so weird. Yep, so weird
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.080]   Well, I'm glad to have one actually. Thank you for bringing it. Oh sure
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.440]   Check eBay because I'm wondering if I checked a minute
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.400]   Did you show up in the show? Let's just see if it's just what are you searching for cardboard? Yeah
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.440]   Google cardboard, right? No
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.000]   You know, I was chatting chatting with a googler a little bit last night and was saying that you know
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.040]   There's still this these two product lines the chrome line and the android line that still exists
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.360]   And I think that it it couldn't be a source of confusion if not for consumers and certainly for for developers
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.600]   You have the two open source platforms. It still seemed to be you know hooked into one another but solving the same problems and what's going on
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:45.280]   And he said, you know, I think I think the idea was that like one of them would really succeed and the other wouldn't but it turned out that they both really succeeded
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.400]   So, you know, we're keeping them around and we know it's a potential source of confusion
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.800]   But they're both doing so well and solving problems
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.800]   And so and I think you know today what we saw I think another takeaway from today was this marriage between I think chrome and android are starting to
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.600]   Come together. I mean android is not a browser. Yeah chrome is a browser
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.440]   But now what the other we didn't talk about before the fact that in in your in your recent's on the phone
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.360]   Yes, it mixes in web pages and applications
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.200]   Tabs considered a singular singular activity and in search
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.280]   You can go in and one of the results on the search can be an app that you happen to have so apps are android
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.680]   Chrome is the web and they are now starting to mix in so this whole idea that in my world media is
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:35.440]   Well, you're either the web's dead and we're all gonna have apps oops. Nobody downloads and runs the apps were all the web
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.000]   And in google they're mixed in
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.680]   What did you think of the and did you understand the chrome book integration with an ad?
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.320]   Tell me I don't even you laugh when I said
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.520]   So we were exhausted at that point it was really really late
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.080]   Does they were running android apps?
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.560]   You were really keyed into this I just was like so excited next to me. I could feel this excitement
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.720]   This could be huge
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.400]   I understand it so they're running android apps. They're running android apps on chrome favorite. Not in mind you. I already have
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.080]   um
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.400]   Dropbox is it a chroma everton so he showed ever note he had ever note on his phone
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.120]   And it was exact same
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.880]   On his now is that because he installed as a chrome extension?
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.480]   I think I think there must be some kind of runtime android on here
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.000]   There's gotta be a run
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.160]   But what it means is that is that I can put again the phone becomes the center of everything
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.360]   So I can show on the tv or on my laptop
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.000]   Android if I have a nap that I like and I like the way it operates. I can now run it on my
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.080]   Chromebook now it's chrome book. It's not chrome. It's not it's not other operating systems
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.920]   It's just this operating system, but they're pro they're probably proud of the chrome book
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.840]   Success they showed vine which is not available on the chrome book
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:56.800]   Right, right and it looked like it was the vine it was the aspect i wonder about can I finally get um
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.200]   um
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   Microsoft's dear phone service skype
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.840]   Skype too would be one of them
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.040]   Um, does it is do you have to go to the chrome store and install?
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.720]   Yeah, they said that it's still still the still early days
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.320]   And of course, you know the pixel. I think is the only touch screen no no no there are other
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.160]   There are
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.640]   We could use the trackpad to do touch yes, so you would work
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:32.560]   Um, they showed flip board which is also not on chrome right right right flip board ever note and vine they showed they can it can show in a
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560]   It's kind of yeah, so what this does
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.800]   It strengthens chrome because you can get tons more apps on chrome now
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.640]   It strengthens strengthens the link between android and chrome which was i point earlier that they were really becoming much better integrated
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.000]   Uh, and it says that mobile is preeminent uber allis
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.600]   So uh, they were not at all clear about the mechanics, but no i'm not gathering that the idea is
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.880]   You will then see an app in the chrome. I don't understand
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.080]   Yeah, I don't understand right it sounds like so will there be a separate app store for chrome books that is android apps
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.160]   Will that's a good question because it said some of your favorite apps
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.920]   So it it didn't say all apps will suddenly run
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.000]   You do have to love the idea that you can unlock the chrome book by getting near it with
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.840]   Yeah, that's cool. That's what i mean.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.200]   In my 8 20 character no, it's 32 character google password every time
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.200]   I always get frustrated on my phone too when I want to get to my cards. I've got it right so the fact that they're thinking that way
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:40.400]   Uh, I think we all have the dedication stuff. They didn't promo us will also show notifications
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.120]   From your phone, but we use push bullet something you recommend. I really like yeah
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:50.000]   I like it a lot all the time on all my devices at some point where vijai said uh, oh, yeah
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.960]   I got a notification on my chrome OS that my battery was running low and i'm such a delightful experience
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.480]   Tonight's turn to japan said that's never a delightful experience
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.400]   Never a like full of your batteries running out. I don't like
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.920]   What it's a chrome extension that allows for the downloading of android apps
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.280]   Says android central it looked like it was running in a hangouts like window
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:19.440]   Uh for on the screen. Yes, so that so it sounds like it was no extension. Uh chrome books are intel, right?
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.280]   Are they in my arm? Are they arm or the intel? That's an intel device, isn't it?
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.520]   I think it's intel there was a little robot dressed in an intel. So the apps are gonna have to run in
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.480]   uh, oh hold on hold on because these are our maps, right?
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.720]   I just I just referred to something where I geeky way to do it in 2012. Oh
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.920]   They're talking about
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.680]   Blue stacks probably yeah, but we can do the blue stacks is an emulator so blue stacks lets you run android apps on windows
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.240]   You're mad it's gonna be something like blue stacks. I would think
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.960]   But unless it's casting from your phone, which is not that I wasn't mirroring. I was running it was running. Yeah. Yeah
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.560]   Um
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.960]   Yeah, it was an odd thing to spend but here your point about here is an odd thing to spend time on
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.240]   If they made a version of art that ran on intel
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.360]   Arts the runtime, right then you could take an APK and just run it right. Yeah
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.560]   well
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.720]   Except for different calls. I mean you need the android layer. Yeah, just gonna have to be a wine like yeah a layer of android
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.480]   Right calls. Otherwise it wouldn't work. Yeah, Jason how old during the keynote was saying android laptop
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.240]   And he's like this is basically it right no, but it with all the benefits of a Chromebook right right right?
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.200]   Which are many by now I
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:40.240]   I've come around you know, I know I I for education you you you you think that crow well
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.560]   Anywhere you don't want to have your user be able to do anything
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.440]   Chromebook is an excellent choice. I do everything the more than a year that right struggle or that no one is not
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.160]   No, we give out. Where does it call that?
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.160]   Crowna
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.080]   No, because I couldn't get
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.200]   Netflix no Netflix on crouton
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:10.320]   But now on home you can download movies and shows and yeah, no, it's a beautiful more than a year. This has been my machine
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.640]   It's interesting that they use the Amazon sales rankings as they're sort of
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.920]   There's actually a lot of mention of other companies right there was represent by the top 10 top 10 highest rated laptops on amazon
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.880]   And there was a lot of that right they talked about the twitter dev rel group gave them access to the streaming api for them to show the google
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.000]   Cloud live stuff. There was a few mentions of samsung contributing their not stuff the android l there was the
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.880]   Amazon
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.320]   That was that was peace right there. Yeah, right but while we're talking about other companies
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.080]   Let us have a moment to curse
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.280]   Verizon
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.440]   Now what because when people bought the oh, this is a bad one and google had to make this google had to make it good
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   It wasn't google's fault for rising you when I when I spent fourteen hundred dollars on my pixel chrome book
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.920]   I got light what lifetime no well. Yeah lifetime or two years. I forget like i'm out of tears tears
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.560]   Data from verizon hundred megs a month not much
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.360]   But it was you know you could when you're in a pinch you got it
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.400]   And then verizon just started cutting off for the year saying f you'd all upper cost perces. That's what we do
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.720]   We're right wait a minute. They just cut off
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.360]   They said we're not gonna give you two years. Yeah, they just started stopping it and customers didn't know
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.280]   And something their year comes up because it's about now for a lot of people and they just stop
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.160]   And so I know i'm shrieking what's wrong? Uh, well a lot of things
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.000]   Uh, and so then google is giving out a hundred fifty dollar
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.040]   Uh give certificates. Well, that's gonna cost them like fifteen hundred bucks. Hey, hey, hey
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.000]   Hey, you mean every single person about a chrome book will get a hundred fifty dollars. Well, there's a chrome book lte. Oh
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.640]   Um, like I said, it's cut so it's thirty five dollars thousands. They're gonna be out
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.280]   Breaking chops as usual
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   Seriously, how many people do you think they're not ready? I've any yeah, no seriously
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.040]   But verizon what what so i mean, what's wrong with verizon i agree?
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.040]   That's not nice. Ah not nice verizon
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.640]   Uh, they did bury a lot of nuggets
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.160]   And I have to say i'm i felt like there were crumbs things like well, we bought quick office
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.120]   So now you can use google docs and edit native native
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.400]   Yeah, yeah
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.680]   It felt like a yeah, they turned microsoft into an api they just cut into
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.080]   They also said if you now this was a little bit of a
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.400]   Fudge they said ten bucks for unlimited data for google drive if you use google drive for business
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.880]   But they didn't mention is that's only if five of you buy google drive for business
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:53.840]   And ten bucks each otherwise if just one of you buys it, it's just a terabyte but in fact terabyte is a lot of yeah
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.600]   Uh, they certainly are and have been undercutting the prices
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.960]   That was there was two angles i was going up to the work audience one was being able to have a work partition on your phone
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.080]   And two that was the thanks to knocks by sam's right and then two was being able to use
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:15.280]   Docs they added functionality office to drive right in terms of office and more security and storage
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:21.680]   To try to encourage more companies and the percentages the number of colleges that have gone google was really impressive
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.720]   It was high the colleges universities were the highest
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.560]   So they broke out fortune 500 colleges universities and startups
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:34.240]   Now if you if you told me that I would have said well, obviously start most you know the highest percentage of you know groups
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:41.040]   Those groups that have gone google I would have said startups. It wasn't it was universities. Yes. Yeah, right and then and then
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.920]   Colorado is google. Yeah, we're trying to switch a kidney. Yeah, are you?
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.560]   My mr. Bartlett my dean growls at me every time she can't do
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.040]   Uh edit trace or well, I mean and now you can't be happy red by means that is gonna be happy
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.320]   um
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.000]   Yeah, the gosh there's a lot here that they I mean was fine, but they could have cut
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.040]   They need a they need a tougher editor. They needed car their cards to be prioritized
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.680]   This is I think where the structure of google really hurts them because they're trying to keep everybody
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.800]   Within an entrepreneurial spirit and the feeling of autonomy
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.520]   But then what happens and you can see this it must have happened
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.520]   Is that they all that they the call went out. All right who wants to present a IO
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.200]   Me me me okay who and then they did some sort of process. Yeah, then what they got was mud
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.280]   And we started the list of what wasn't there though. Well number one. I didn't see any google glass
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.080]   They saw glass holes
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.480]   Lots of people wearing glass. No googlers wearing glass. Although they did update glass
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.640]   Today they have a new version of glass that has two gigabytes of ram
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.720]   You're not gonna get I don't use 10 megabytes of my class because I don't use it
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.960]   But I found we're an explorer. I feel well, you know what when you became an explorer you understood
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.680]   This is a beta program. This is not going to be the final so they've doubled the ram
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.760]   um
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.640]   And you're not going to get it. Uh, what would you would you know?
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.120]   So they just put them on sale in the UK would you invest in it now?
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.440]   When they didn't brag about it when they didn't do anything about it?
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:16.480]   No, no, no, sorry nice people nice interesting technology a lot of things done. I go back to what I said before
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.560]   three functions
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.520]   That we kind of always said this I always said this is I also said this is to the iPhone
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.640]   What the this is this is whatever follows what they knew
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.800]   Newton yeah, it's a new 12 new apps including shazam so you can say okay glass recognizes song
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.360]   I can pull out my phone and do it. I mean, okay glass a basketball training aid
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:45.600]   You need to get a specially equipped basketball and you throw it and then you get the little feedback after each shot
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.280]   It went in it didn't go in I can tell that now it never goes in. I got an F thrown in hard
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:56.240]   Yeah, make sure you get the arc the perfect arc. You've released is poorly timed
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240]   swish
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.200]   Maybe it will say swish put that sensor in a golf ball
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.680]   You know what?
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.680]   They should go for the golf ball. Everything is the basketball crowd. They've got more money to spend on glass
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.960]   Yeah, you're more isolated with a golf course. Don't be gonna see you look like a dork, right?
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:19.920]   You already do look like a dork. I wear a lot of glass holes wearing tasseled shoes in a glass out there on the I can see
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.320]   Yeah
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.440]   They all you get driving directions for your cart. Yeah, I can see it. Yeah, also nothing about google plus
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:31.520]   That's let's say there for a second last week to last year that they talked about google. Oh, yeah
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.360]   Yeah, we were very excited. Yeah, yeah, vik was talking. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it was where i was there and i remember saying
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.600]   We saw Bradley last night at the street. They did events and I mean there was a lot of there was a lot of
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.760]   Is that when they redesigned the app? Yep, there was not a not a word about it
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.960]   Not a syllable
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.840]   And and i've been arguing that you know i'm one of the ones that holds out
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.760]   I still like google plus and people make fun of me and all that but now i'm still using here
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:57.840]   I would say in the brick house. It's our number one social network by far
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.560]   One thing I heard from somebody who talked to a googler that they might either gonna start splitting up
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:10.000]   Google plus this is this is this is fourth hand so who knows but but the argument is that if you look at what you can do with photos and google
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.560]   Plus it's incredible it is nobody knows it because it's inside the plus
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.840]   Make up it and you know i made this point on the show a couple of weeks ago
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.960]   Zuckerberg talking about breaking up the big blue app. He doesn't care if you're using what's app use what's app
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.480]   It's fine. I own it now
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.640]   Uh, he's not trying to integrate it and everything google does not have one big portal app you use
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.720]   It has an underlying user database across a bunch of different functions
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.320]   So they broke that rule when it came to google plus i think google plus
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.880]   Is an underlying database of relationships that brings relevance to you
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.920]   Across many different functions and if you want to do photos now then do a great photo
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.800]   Function if you want to talk to people who are on google plus go through that
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.360]   Right, right?
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.040]   Hangouts go to that photos and hangouts are great
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.160]   And those that those are the aspects of google plus that i use every day
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.960]   Um, but i wouldn't say that i use google plus i mean it's really kind of it's a marketing problem
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.520]   Right you say google plus and people think you're talking about the social network
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.120]   Right, um, but but it's really an umbrella to a ton of different products
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.120]   I think it just profiles and sign into youtube to comment right? I mean
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:19.040]   Just because they didn't mention it at a developer event does not mean they're not using it. Well, they know there's a criminal analogy though
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.120]   Yeah, they know that
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.040]   They mentioned nexus phones. They didn't show you the nexus phones. They didn't develop any nexus phone
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.200]   They mentioned they didn't mention glass. They didn't mention google plus
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.240]   That's really what are we we're the criminologists, right?
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.920]   Well, uh, so what else was not there? Yeah, what else was not so nexus voice search
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.520]   Search can i just point out
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   Last year remember they did that great search thing and search for the golden gate
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.920]   Research functions on tv
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.400]   But they showed yeah, they showed the material design in the search interface on they didn't enhance the functionality of search in any way
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.080]   Right, but they did they did do the like the museum and how do I get there?
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.120]   So we
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:08.000]   Showed them really how searches being used in a modern they showed links to your apps in android, right? So
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.640]   Uh, you know an open table
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.360]   Say open this that's cool. So, you know, I actually really liked that. Yeah, I like the process
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.240]   Communication was great search when you search for the tour in google earth
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.320]   If you search for something that you would have done in an app, all right?
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.680]   Said here's the store. So that's that's true. That's true. That was search on the phone, right?
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.520]   That wasn't actually google search
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.800]   I like that I didn't mention ads in any way adwords ads sense
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.240]   No phones or tablets nothing in terms of making them or anything new coming or
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.800]   Right, which we really been wondering about
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.880]   Yeah, no new Chromebooks or wrong
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.520]   Chrome boxes
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.800]   Yeah hardware was really scared it was yeah, all this talk yesterday
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.480]   Well part of the talk yesterday was that nest is taking over much of the hardware
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:59.040]   Well in fact, he's gonna take movie. Yeah, no mention of nexus phones or nest tablets or nest or nest
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.680]   Yeah, and even you know, they have a whole new thing when nest examples about nest when google bought drop cam really was nest that bought drop cam
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:11.120]   And that's how it was pitched even though net google is a holy. Oh, this is a holy owned
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.680]   subsidiary of google
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.080]   So maybe that's interesting next nest tony fidel would be the guy to run your hardware program, I guess
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.120]   um no mention of robots
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   Well, there was but from the pro-pro-pro-tester only for the protester
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.240]   um
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.040]   Now is there another keynote tomorrow? I don't think there is in the past there is not split it up at it too
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:42.480]   The rest of google.io much like wwdc's developer sessions and some hot, you know blue sky, you know wacky wonderful things about about
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.200]   You know life and computers and then i don't know
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.920]   At all or gmail encryption
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.320]   No, that was the other thing I thought that if larry had come to talk which would have been five hours longer
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.680]   um
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.840]   I the question I wanted to ask was about security
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.760]   and um
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.240]   Well, they addressed it a little bit with the enterprise stuff right the encryption uh both ways separating
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.640]   your uh your
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.960]   Personal stuff on your phone from your business stuff right that's not against nsa kind of
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.800]   Security and they showed the gmail interface redesign, but uh, but no they didn't they really didn't talk about
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.200]   With the exception of the knock stuff and the enterprise stuff. They didn't talk about security too much
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.600]   Um now
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.200]   This was the part I think where you cut off they went to the google cloud platform stuff
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.320]   Which was pretty pretty heavy developer. Yeah, it was a kind of a snooze
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.200]   Because it is a developer conference
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:37.520]   I mean that was hour three at that point and but then but then but then the google play the woman from google play got up and talked about
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.960]   um
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.800]   A purify she announced the acquisition acquired. What is a purify?
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.360]   A purify is an app that helps you test your android apps across a bunch of different devices
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.560]   So do real world testing so it's it's basically helping developers
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.520]   Deal with the fragmentation issue and not having a you know a mass a collection of every size screen
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.000]   and and and a variety of device
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.480]   She mentioned google fit
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:05.280]   Which I was surprised that they didn't talk about during the android wear section, but okay
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.960]   Uh, so it's a single set of ipis to manage fitness data
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:15.280]   Um, and it blends data from multiple, you know apps and devices and when we saw we saw a few examples
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.120]   She I think that noom was the app those a weight loss app that was up on screen
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.520]   Then that connects to your why things so why things are we things the scale?
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.000]   I say why things but I don't know what the uh right?
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.400]   Uh, nike fuel is going to be integrating with with google fits. Oh, sorry
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.040]   But just as nike gives up its devices by
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.680]   Yeah
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:44.640]   Fuel fuel is an odd it's it's a it's a mean less currency what it tries to do fuel tries to bring all activity into one kind of point structure
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.960]   Which so does this so does the misfit?
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:53.280]   What you recall it? Yeah, what's that thing again? Oh, it's the misfit. It's the fit. No, no, no, no, no, no
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.280]   I lost my swift
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.560]   This is the it's called misfit. Um, I like it because uh that thing's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I like it
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.600]   Yeah, and it looks like you're an Egyptian god
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:10.720]   Or something is it masculine enough? It's masculine very very masculine shouldn't shouldn't carry a MRSA with it
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.120]   We don't we're not going to do a change log. I guess
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   This is a change logs
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:24.240]   Here's a list on the rundown of things that were not things that were not 10 of them from read right web
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.720]   10 things google did not talk about at google.io
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.360]   Um android silver
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.160]   So they didn't mention nexus, but they didn't mention anything else in terms of
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.760]   Google devices android one was the bit was the device
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.880]   Right the right power right that was that they're not even going to make that that's just a platform for
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.200]   people others who are going to make it right um
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.640]   They didn't mention android nearby, which is a proximity from uh service from google
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.480]   That was rumored to be announced at io kind of like ibeacon
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.120]   uh glass nexus
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.520]   Project ara and project tango project tango
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.360]   We had re dashed out of there to get here, but there was there's a booth
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.600]   I'm sure there's a booth and i'm sure there's going to be some ara
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:14.240]   I wouldn't be surprised they gave away some arkits this because ara is the motor roll as research project that was a modular phone
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.920]   Yeah, yeah tango is the mobile 3d machine vision project
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:25.040]   Uh no updates will develop recession sometimes they get little kits that just the people who are in that one session if you're lucky enough to
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.400]   Yeah
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:26.640]   uh
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.360]   Chrome os updates nest and android home. We thought there would be a lot more mention of home
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.720]   Yeah, I were they had a couch. I thought it was yeah home in hell. Yeah, they had a couch up on stage and we thought oh this is
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:43.200]   Uh felt like a nexus q demo throwback last year. They gave us android studio
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:48.640]   They didn't really mention that although they had a lot of developer tools that worked with studio including uh, you know
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:56.880]   Realtime online debugging, which is pretty cool. Mm-hmm. And google plus. Yeah, so that's pretty much uh, that's pretty much what they didn't say
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:01.760]   But I didn't feel like it was missing because I didn't feel like this was in any attempt to make a state of the world
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:08.800]   Uh address and the fact that Larry pager. He was there in the front row. We saw a picture of what i did
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.640]   Yeah, he was there but didn't say anything as he did last year. Maybe wisely
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.040]   He probably was advised by people don't mention the island that you want to be on
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.040]   You know, can't we all just get along that just didn't play too well?
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.920]   But I think having the ceo speak is important
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.160]   That's that's one thing you see at all the other companies events the ceo does speak
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.280]   and um and and kind of sets the tone
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:38.160]   Um, and I don't I think he's missing. I think Larry is very shy and very
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.520]   Hands-off maybe not in in uh one-to-one settings, but in a setting like this, right?
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.320]   Um, now I think this I think that this was a year of them
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.280]   better developing their platforms
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.640]   and bringing them together and making sense of them and and
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   Revealing and enforcing principles of design
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:06.320]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at hover.com. One of the things google announced is that they're going to become a domain registrar
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.320]   But there's some weird little things in there that you may think I can do better for one of the things they said is
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.480]   Oh, and we'll give you who is privacy as part of the price. Well, so does hover.com
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:24.160]   Uh, they said uh, you have email redirection. Yes, so does hover.com fact everything that google offers hover offers without any limits
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.240]   They go for some reason said you have a limit limited number of dns requests per year
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.440]   I don't know what that number means. I don't know if it's a lot or a little
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:38.000]   But why even have to worry about that and do you really want to put all your eggs in the google basket hover is?
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.080]   Great domain name management just like everybody else. They're all registered with I can
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.440]   Their official domain registrars, but you get great tools that make it easy to manage your domains
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:56.240]   You have a simple process of registering a domain doesn't take any time at all. You don't have a lot of clicking
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.440]   You get who is privacy. They've got all the big extensions
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.040]   Just like everybody else.com.net country codes
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:07.760]   They also have some really great new extensions like the dot club, which I love
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:13.120]   They also have the best customer support around now. I don't know what kind of customer support you get from google
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.280]   But it's not from a python script. Let's put it that way
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.880]   When you call hover.com during business hours, you will get no wait no hold no transfer phone service
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.840]   A representative is there to help you if you want they will move your existing domain
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.440]   Over to hover.com their concierge domain movement
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:38.000]   That's great. In fact you renew your domains for just ten dollars a year
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.360]   Or ten dollars to move the domains that gives you an additional year
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.520]   Plus who is privacy plus a lot of other great benefits hovers fabulous
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.720]   I think you're gonna love it all my domain names are registered at hover
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.800]   They now offer volume discounts too
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.720]   When you uh when you renew numerous domains ten or more
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.520]   You get a discount
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   I have so many domains
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.320]   That's gonna save me a lot of money
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:08.240]   The more domains you have the less you have to pay if you're one of those people as I am who registers domain names kind of
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.840]   Just whenever I think of it because we wind up. I have any idea how many you have
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:15.440]   I can go to hover.com. It looks like 20 or 30. I mean it's a lot
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:19.920]   Uh, that's the other thing I can quickly see at hover.com. I can manage them. I can move around
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.240]   It really is the best way to do it. The valet transfer service awesome
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.240]   For free hover will take care of the entire process let you know when your domains are settled in your hover account
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.360]   They they'll even transfer the dns settings
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:39.520]   Nobody does this in every other case you have to figure out what your dns settings are change them go over to hover change
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.920]   Nope, they'll do it. No matter how many domain names you have at no additional cost
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   That is great. That's great huffer.com
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.040]   I love them you will too
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:58.080]   By the way use the offer code twig six you get 10 off your first purchase hover h o ver.com
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.720]   I maybe you don't have a tip or it looks like you do you got something you want to do? I do I have
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.960]   I'm recycling content a little bit. We talked about this on all been android a couple episodes ago
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.880]   But today at the keynote they talked about how in android l you're gonna get
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:19.360]   Your notifications on your lock screen. They're gonna look really pretty so you're not gonna have to unlock your phone and swipe down your shade
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:25.280]   Well, I'm doing something similar right now with the an app called dynamic notifications for android
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:31.920]   Yeah, it'll put notifications of your choice. So I could say hey just show me, you know slack and trello and hang out and nothing else
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.320]   Um, it'll put it right on your lock screen. So when you're you know, you can if you have your phone out
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.000]   You're doing something else you can just glance down at it and see your notifications and and you can
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.800]   So there's a lock screen widget
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.520]   You can also affix a widget to your home screen. That's there with your notifications
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.480]   You don't have to mess with the shade and there's there's a bunch of options here custom screen timeouts and you can you know
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.000]   Do transparency and select themes really great app love it free
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.560]   Within app purchases for some premium features, but it's really cool. So if you can't wait for the android l notification
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:09.440]   Update you can kind of get some of it. Not quite as pretty as l is gonna be but might hold you over until the until the release
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.520]   So that's dynamic notifications. You're gonna are you gonna get download the l stuff
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:19.440]   I guess they're gonna give you images for the x's 5 and then x's 7 this week. Yeah. Yeah
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.160]   Old nexus 5 line. Yeah, well, I mean certainly have an x's 7 line around that I would install it on
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.720]   I might not install it on my like daily driver phone, you know, it's because uh because it is a preview
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.520]   But yeah for sure. I want to say I'm my 5 and I an x's 5. Maybe I'll put it on there
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.720]   Be fun to play with yeah, I usually stay away from beta. What do they do you have to be you have to be developer?
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.600]   Do you have to pay any money? Do you have to say I won't never speak of this
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.720]   I shall not speak of this thing we are doing together. That's that's a good question. They generally don't
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.160]   Yeah, they're very I mean, well unlike apple where you have to be the developer program at 100 bucks a year or whatever
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.160]   Android it's usually just a straight up download. I mean, I'll try it. Yeah
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:03.920]   Jeff you have I'm sure a number I I do I decided how many cardboard boxes to prove will give away. Well, 40% of them went to women
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.480]   Yeah
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   Gee don't resist either bragging about that
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.520]   You know, yeah, it's a step. It's an improvement. It's not far enough
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.120]   But we saw the real future. I just put on the rundown you saw it earlier
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.600]   But people didn't see it the video of the middle the girl middle school coders was a tear in the eye moment
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.160]   Jeff looked at me and I was gonna like
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.360]   It was the same way
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.520]   Uh, it's on the under the number of the rundown. All right. Let me pull it up. Really quite a
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's watch a little video
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.880]   Do you have audio
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.640]   They have to live because I can ask everyone. Oh, they were all in the front row at the
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.200]   Uh
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.240]   Why is this sound so bad?
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.800]   Christian sensor so that way
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:58.880]   For each I feel like you're not getting the oh, I see this is a video from the conference somebody
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.120]   Always at a tape the conference. So so the mess of one little thing
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.840]   It can mess up like the whole app. That's really great. Don't you love that?
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]   So they made an app for him
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:14.720]   They care about me that's why they make
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.360]   Is that happy so they made an app for him?
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.720]   Oh my god, so you can find his way around the class. Okay. Now I am for time
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:29.680]   Six girls quoted this in middle school. Yeah, it is the coolest thing on her. So I apologize for the quality
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.760]   This is actually a screen cap
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.240]   from the event, but
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.240]   Yeah, you see send up a check in back on stage. My favorite part is just yeah, you know, you mess up some of the code and the whole thing just breaks
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.280]   I know
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.040]   Breaks now I feel really pathetic with my
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.640]   My app pick. Thanks jeff. Yeah
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.600]   You make a cry out here or not
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.360]   This is not gonna make you cry unless it's tears of joy
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.040]   So I uh, you know, I use the go pro as I was mentioning zip lining
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.840]   And so it's the easiest way to use the go pro is to install the go pro app on your android device
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:11.920]   I use it on all my uh apps devices. It's free. It lets you control it. You connect right to the camera
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.240]   You get a preview. It's just the it's just so great
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.720]   But I don't know when they added this there's a new feature though that I love in the settings
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.840]   You can use the go pro image of the day
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:29.040]   As your wallpaper on your android phone. So you get new wallpaper every single day and it's always some cool go pro image
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.320]   Uh, today's image is a middle school soccer field
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.680]   And uh, it actually works out really nicely as a as a background
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.320]   You can kind of see it to the transparency here. Uh, there's a goalie stopping a kick
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.040]   But these are always gorgeous images lat yesterday. It was uh, it was an aquarium
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.640]   Uh and free and easy way you don't even have to have a go pro camera
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.120]   Just download the app and uh turn on the image of the day and every day you'll get an image from the go
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.320]   Reminds me the thing that poured me most today. What was that?
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:03.440]   Was ambient pictures on your tv. I like that visual musac for life. Yeah, I just found that unbearable
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.880]   I'm just looking for another way to leave my tv. Oh, yeah more power consumption more. Oh, yeah, she's
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.600]   Wait, wait, this is the images from your own device. It's your pictures
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.040]   It's got the weather
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.360]   No
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360]   I can see the real pack right there
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.080]   Shitting all over the place. Love it's the biggest picture frame the best picture frame in your house, jeff
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.160]   Well, you didn't like that line
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:32.720]   No, no, I thought that was that was just ridiculous. That was that was google that was trying too hard
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.600]   Well, they got this
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   Oh
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.960]   How many remote picture frames if we bought the grandparent's it never get filled in I refuse I refuse to buy another one of those
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, I was like, I'll rig up the tablet, but I'm not buying another one of those stupid picture frames
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.480]   Well now you can just get them a $35 chromecast
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.200]   Simple enough
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.000]   Apparently google play services is now rolling out. I just checked I'm not getting it
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.320]   But 5.0 of play services
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:07.120]   We'll be rolling out with the new security tools and red wear support so I got the 4-4 update just now
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.080]   I have it I did it in but there on your next is 54444
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.960]   And look for google play services 5 it should make its way to all devices over the next
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.240]   Few days. This is not google play store. Right. This is that little puzzle piece of services
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:25.360]   But it's it's actually more important than the store because it's a lot of stuff behind the scenes
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:30.080]   It's going to support android wear labels, which means your watches what you get tomorrow will work
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.720]   That's why they had to push it out google cast
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.240]   Uh adds closed caption support from chromecast
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.200]   Um, there's a new save to wallet button
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.520]   to save off
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.000]   Offers from your app to your wallet grade
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.960]   improved in app purchase ads
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.160]   Forget it don't get it. It's terrible
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.000]   Unless you got a watch why why?
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.920]   Uh, there's a few more things app indexing api anyway
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.440]   This is these are always big and you don't really have much of a choice. So enjoy it
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.800]   It will be foisted upon you. It's going to be it's going to be forced on you whether you want it or not
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:09.920]   Hey, it's so nice to have jeff and jina here. I feel like we're
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.640]   Is this a second time in a month?

[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.240]   And all all a bit part of it is that I just really excited about that watch
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.960]   You get something you get a watch what you could have bought for less than the airfare, but fine
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960]   I mean, I'm sorry. Yeah, I wouldn't want to see where that is
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.040]   Well, I was certainly happy to be here today and be at all about android last night and I got to check
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.600]   That was nice and you were and it was good to see you and I
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.240]   Live on all about android if you haven't seen the show yet

[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.120]   I wasn't wasted time. That's 93 million selfies
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:26.880]   The what happens tomorrow and the next day at ios really if for developers is just tomorrow it's seminars
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.960]   It's a workshop
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.080]   Coding usually knows noise does not emerge not significant news emerges
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.040]   There will be some low-level announcements that
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:37.920]   Perfect that
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.160]   Choirifications that didn't come out of the keynote people will write up some you know other things that they learned and
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:49.120]   There might sometimes there, you know, kits developer kits given out for the the lesser projects like, you know, maybe tango
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:56.000]   Maybe our I wouldn't be surprised if we heard a little bit more about tango and ara containerizing the cloud with docker designing for wearables
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.480]   Grow your app with google identity
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:05.440]   Uh, it's google plus platform 3d tablet and oscar and a little cache a 3d tablet. Okay, so that's tango
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:12.160]   Um cross platform interaction design instant by everywhere go wallet the dawn of fast data
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.360]   The art of run time. That's that's art
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.000]   upgrading the engine mid-flow
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.520]   In every case this is art or whatever for people who are developing there deep dive into these things best for developers
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:33.040]   Yeah, so they're so they're gonna meet so they are gonna talk about nests, but it's gonna be stuff. That's there wasn't keynote robotics in a new world
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.080]   with a protester no doubt
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.000]   There were also people arrested there on google in
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.360]   Star Trek plastic outfits stormtroopers
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.400]   Wars
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.640]   You're looking for
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:07.680]   No, the problem is it's brain latency. It's true. It just takes time
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.600]   It's latency. That's like a Google cast
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:19.760]   Uh and on and on and on it goes you guys got to go to some of those just to find out what the hell google cast is dev ops power tools
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:26.560]   I'll mean there. How about debugging dart apps with web storm. That's going on right now. I'm sorry. We missed that. That's
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.920]   Three days of building useless stuff the makings of the world's craziest makers conference
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.920]   What did you think speaking of which of the bowling ball the treble?
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.280]   Made the geeks happy. Yeah, I mean, you know, it was just something for people to look at while the countdown was
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:49.040]   My gag was a huge mechanical thing over the corner. I said, oh the algorithm
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:52.000]   That's how it works
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.520]   There is an ignite event. I think Kevin Marx is going to the right that's okay
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:00.480]   That's four o'clock this afternoon if you run it if you run you can get back to it. Thank you jeff
