[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   This week in Google will show where we cover the latest
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.360]   news from the Google verse and the Facebook and all of that stuff.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840]   And lo and behold, look who's here.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.800]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.840]   And the author of-- oh, you know what?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.040]   I was going to bring it out because I have all your books.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.760]   I realized I have all your books on my books
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.560]   shelf spread around, so I have a stack.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960]   Anyway, what would Google do?
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.880]   Public parts his latest Gutenberg, the Geek, and Geek
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.640]   Sparing News.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.280]   That's so amazing you had this memorized.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.000]   But you repeated it about 100 times so nicely.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.040]   I have them all.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.520]   I've read them all.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.240]   I'm a fan.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.280]   And of course, he blogs regularly at Buzzmachine.com,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.360]   so there's a lot more to see.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.040]   Irriggerly now, I'd say.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.480]   You know, I read and started my blog and leoville.com.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.720]   And with all good intentions, this is about four posts
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.440]   is typical, right?
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   And then you lose interest.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.540]   I know.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360]   It makes me sad that I've got to figure it out.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   I have a lot of posts in mind.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.280]   I know what I want to write.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   I have the content.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.040]   I just have to sit down and write.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.200]   Writing's hard.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.520]   That's why I have respect for you and Ronna Mottio, who
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.560]   is from R's technical cover.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.640]   He sits down to write.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.680]   Does he ever write?
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   What's the longest article you've written on R's?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.200]   History of Android was 40,000 words.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.520]   That's a book.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.240]   That's a book, isn't it?
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.120]   Yes, small book.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.400]   To novella.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.480]   That's what my editor told me when he had to look through all
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600]   that poor guy.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.360]   Wow.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.840]   Wow.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.160]   Well, anyway, great to have you both.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.240]   Talk about Google and the Google verse.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.360]   Ron did write-- I would say is probably a fairly lengthy
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   article.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.160]   It fits.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.800]   I would call it.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.880]   And definitive, no less.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.720]   The 2016 Google tracker.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.880]   Not your first time doing this, Ron.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.920]   No, usually I do it twice a year before I/O
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.240]   and at the beginning of the year.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.480]   Well, when Google's announced the dates for I/O, by the way.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   So now we know when you'll be writing your next one.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.920]   Yep.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.160]   This is everything Google's working on for 2016.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.600]   And I imagine this is increasing complexity thanks
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   to Alphabet, right?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.240]   It's way longer than last year's.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.680]   Yeah, I just try to cover all the--
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.240]   yeah, all those little weird satellite companies
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.560]   and everything Google's doing.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.200]   And it's interesting how fast they move
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.440]   and how many different projects.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   And actually, that is obsolete now because Google X
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.680]   isn't Google X anymore.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.640]   The minute you press send, it was obsolete, I think.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.720]   Yeah, I've done about six different versions
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   of that little graphic while I was making this.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.200]   And still making more.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.160]   What's Google X called now?
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.840]   Just X.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   X.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.840]   There's no Google anymore.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.080]   So the theory is that all the Alphabet companies that
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.520]   left Google that still have Google brand names
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.480]   are going to drop the Google brand.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.280]   They have to, right?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.160]   That would make a little more sense.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.720]   But right now, there's still Google Capital
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.960]   and Google self-driving cars and something else that
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.920]   has a Google brand name, but it's not part of Google anymore.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.000]   So what you need to do, by the way,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.360]   is rename the Google tracker to the tracker.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.720]   Yeah, the Alphabet tracker.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.200]   I don't know.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   Alphabet's scary to put in a title.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It is.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.680]   We're never going to call this show this week in Alphabet.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   You're your brand name.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   Sounds like Sesame Street.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.520]   She is for cookie.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   Cookie.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   What did that for me?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.600]   Cookie.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   I think, among other things-- there's
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   quite a few things to talk about in here.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.440]   But one is one that I've been harping on, which
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.520]   is a new messaging app.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.200]   Goodbye, Google Hangouts, you ask.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.320]   And we've heard, of course, of Wall Street Journal's
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.280]   reported about chat bots and so forth.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.600]   But Google does have or had Google Talk, G+ Messenger,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.160]   Google Voice, Hangouts.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.600]   They're current.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.440]   And then if you're using Android, there's a Google SMS
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.240]   Messenger.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   That's at least five solutions.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   Yeah, I think the plan was to have Google+ sort of take
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.400]   over all of this, and then Google+ kind of failed.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.240]   So now they need-- it failed, at least,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   as a Facebook competitor.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.760]   So now they need some kind of messaging solution.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.120]   But they've never really given Hangouts the attention
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   that it needs.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.200]   Could have been so good.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   And yeah, and especially when you've
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.800]   got Facebook buying WhatsApp for however many billions of dollars,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.640]   and WeChat is so big in China and Snapchat's worth,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.880]   however many billion dollars.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.520]   It's like everybody else understands that messaging is this big,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.200]   kind of new social area.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.240]   Is it weird as that sounds?
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's more than that.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.040]   It's a platform.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.680]   And that's why it's something you can't ignore.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.080]   If we're just a new social network, big deal,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.000]   but it's a platform-- when you look at what WeChat does,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.880]   it's as much an operating system as anything else.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.840]   Yeah, you can buy stuff for WeChat and everything else.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   And Google is just so far behind on this,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.520]   where every other major tech company, other than, like you
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   said, Microsoft seems to get that messaging is a big deal,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.680]   and invest is so much money in it.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   Yeah, we actually-- we're talking on Windows Weekly
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.200]   about that.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.920]   Microsoft has also missed the ball on messaging,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.960]   killed MSN Messenger, and replaced it with Yammer
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.720]   on the business side, which has not gone very well.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.640]   And Skype on the consumer side, and then
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   they're kind of as a middle ground, which is Skype for business,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   none of which are very compelling.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.280]   And because Microsoft-- and this is an interesting issue--
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.720]   doesn't have a strong mobile play.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.480]   Windows Phone is not going anywhere.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.800]   They need to figure some out.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.360]   And we were thinking maybe Microsoft and Google
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   should join forces.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.240]   That's the only-- in my opinion, the only way you can stop
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.280]   at this point, the unstoppable Facebook Messenger.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Well, like WeChat and WhatsApp don't really
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.480]   have great desktop clients.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.320]   So I think Google could do very well
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.600]   if they made something that kind of worked on every device
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   you've got.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.280]   Because my big problem with Facebook Messenger
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.040]   is there's really no desktop app.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.960]   There's really no desktop app for WhatsApp
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.160]   or any of those other things.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   So for me, it's hard to get those messages sometimes
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.320]   if I'm working on a real computer.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.120]   As someone who uses both iPhone and Android,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.240]   I use Hangouts because that's the most cross-platform solution.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.280]   It's kind of stunted--
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.120]   well, I don't know.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.920]   Is it stunted?
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.120]   I can't do animated GIFs.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Is that really a draw?
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.480]   I think it can now.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.320]   I think they added that.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.920]   But it has very low resources at Google.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.760]   It's not a favored product over there.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.960]   And you can definitely feel it.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.680]   And all the clients are a little bit different,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.440]   which makes jumping around kind of hard.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.120]   And even for communication stuff,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.600]   like the emoji set is different on all of them now,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.120]   like Android support new ones.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.920]   But the desktop app doesn't.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.400]   It's super weird.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:38.000]   But the new thing as weird as chatbot sound, it kind of sounds
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.240]   like they're taking it in an app direction
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.840]   or like a platform direction, where people will be able to make
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.200]   these chatbots.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   And you'll be able to dig through them,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.240]   or Google will dig through them and find the good ones.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.720]   It sounds like they're finally trying
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.800]   to make something that is a platform.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.600]   Google should buy Telegram.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.120]   I don't know if Telegram's even for sale.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   It's kind of a weird open source/business thing.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.400]   Because Telegram has bots.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   They have all the features that Google would want.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.600]   They could really benefit from recoding the encryption.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.240]   I think Telegram is a great alternative that
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.640]   isn't going anywhere by itself because they're by themselves.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.080]   No, it's not.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.360]   Leo, if you go down to the bottom of the rundown under numbers,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.280]   don't worry, I got plenty.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.320]   David Marcus, the VP of Messaging Products at Facebook,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.000]   has a really interesting post, I think,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.600]   about where he sees it going.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   He has 800 million people on Messenger each month.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.720]   And he has five, well, really four predictions
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   of what he's going to call it.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.200]   This is Darth Vader writing about what he plans to do
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.360]   with the Death Star folks.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.080]   You should read this.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.720]   It is.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.080]   It is.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.040]   It's fascinating to me.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.920]   The first one he predicts this year,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.320]   the death of the phone number.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.080]   Now, I'm not so sure that Facebook is going to--
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.600]   Facebook is going to try to do this for a long time, right?
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.160]   I would love it if they get rid of the phone number.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.560]   But so did Twitter.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.320]   Remember, Leo Laport was my phone number.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   And Twitter wanted this to be the--
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.280]   right now, I guess the alternative to the phone number
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.840]   is your email address.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.320]   But email is not a good messaging platform.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   It's not as immediate as phone calls.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.560]   With Facebook Messenger, you can make phone calls, audio,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.760]   video, you can message.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.120]   But what they don't have right now, what is your Facebook?
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.840]   Do you know, Jeff, what your Facebook handle is on Messenger?
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.400]   No.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.600]   What is the issue?
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.120]   So they need to solve that.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   Yeah, I think they know it.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120]   But you don't need to know it.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.200]   We have to solve that in the space.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   You just say, type my name into the Facebook search box.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.240]   And you'll probably have some kind of search in common.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.360]   Is it much better?
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.160]   We run.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.520]   Ron and Mario is not a common name.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.400]   And there actually are a fair number of Jeff Jarvis's.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.080]   The problem I have is Facebook search.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.800]   They've been saying this is getting better in bits.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.120]   But I want to find the Joe Smith who, blank to blank to blank,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.960]   it's still hard to find the right Joe Smith
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.520]   if you're not already friends with Joe.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.400]   Well, here I am.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.480]   This is Messenger as close as it is right now in the Macintosh
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.000]   for the desktop.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.640]   If you go to messenger.com, this is a web page.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.720]   But so if I type Jeff Jarvis, only because I'm following you,
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.680]   I find you right away.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.600]   You're doing just follow me, we're friends.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.920]   We're friends.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.480]   But if this is going to succeed, it needs to be--
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.640]   OK, look it.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.640]   Number one attribute of any messaging system
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.840]   that would make it killer is I can get to anybody.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.720]   Because right now, if you buy a phone,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.120]   you expect to be able to dial anybody's phone number anywhere.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.720]   That's right.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.800]   And no messaging app today gets that.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.160]   But what is Facebook-- even if you hear people say,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.600]   oh, young people don't use Facebook anymore,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.520]   the one thing I then hear the next sentence is,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.160]   but every young person has to have a Facebook account.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.240]   It is the closest thing we have to universal identity.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.400]   That's why I use Facebook Messenger.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   And as much as I hate to-- it pains me to admit it,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.200]   I think it's the winner.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.400]   But I'm really curious what David Marcus--
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.760]   if he says we're going to replace the disappearing phone
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.400]   number, well, what is the analog in Facebook world?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.720]   Is it searching for your name?
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.120]   I don't think that's it.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.320]   Shouldn't there be like @Jeff Jarvis and an @rod of the--
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.840]   Yeah, there's a lot of--
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.080]   --audio that's unique identifier.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.920]   Yeah, there's vanity URLs you could sign up for.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.080]   I have Leo G. Leport, but I don't think anybody would know that.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   Right.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.800]   And he points out, too, you don't have to have a Facebook account
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.200]   to use Messenger.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   Well, then if you-- OK, then how would I use it then?
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.560]   How would I find you?
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.440]   I guess phone numbers?
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.000]   No, it doesn't--
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.520]   Yes, no, it is phone numbers.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.080]   Phone number, right.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   So then you have to know that.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.360]   But they don't know anybody's--
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.280]   at the same time, he's saying phone numbers disappear.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.600]   Right.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.920]   I don't know.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   The next part of this, fascinating to me most,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.960]   is the ambition of this.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   Is once you have that closest to universal service,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.480]   the three says threads are the new apps.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   And we're thinking, I'll help you interact with businesses
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.400]   or services to buy items, order, rides, purchase airline tickets,
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.640]   talk to customer service in truly frictionless and delightful
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   ways, though I've never had a delightful experience
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.680]   with customer service data.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.920]   It's kind of say here.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.080]   But you know what would be delightful?
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.520]   Not having to talk to customers.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.960]   Amen.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.760]   And by the way, for $100 an hour,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.600]   you can have a personal assistant using a messenger app.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.840]   Do it for you.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.280]   Yep.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.960]   And I think you're going to see more and more of that as well.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.400]   And that's the whole platform aspect.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's about $500 an hour to deal with Verizon, but don't--
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.160]   They charge it.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.040]   Premium.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.800]   Surge pricing has kicked in.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.040]   So threads.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   What does he mean by threads when he says threads
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   are the new apps?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   Is that a message thread?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.280]   There is thread in an app.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.840]   Yeah, I guess there's a thread in an app.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.400]   I mean, I agree.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.240]   And it carries a history, he says, of your interaction
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080]   with that company.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.680]   So the problem is when I was going through my Verizon
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.720]   hell that I recounted, don't worry, I will do it again last
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   week, they would lose the thread constantly.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.680]   Oh yeah, I'll make a note of that in the file.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.560]   B-S found nowhere.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.720]   And now you have a demonstrable--
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.080]   That's why Slack is so huge in the enterprise,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.200]   because you have a record.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.160]   Yes, that's true.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.480]   And it's better than email.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.880]   I mean, email you have a record too,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.080]   but it seems how somehow better than email,
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.240]   searchability very important.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.600]   Google could do well, but you know what has happened here
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.400]   is that Dave Marcus VP of messaging at Facebook
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   has given Google a roadmap.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.560]   Roadmap, yeah.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.040]   Here's what Google doesn't have the identity structure there.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.440]   Now, by the way, it says that brands are showing
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.200]   that interactions will happen more and more in your message
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.720]   or threads.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.280]   Have you ever interacted with a brand on Messenger?
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.040]   No, I don't want to.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.520]   I have an either.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.720]   No, you can do that.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.960]   I mean, what?
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.680]   So your friends with Verizon--
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   No!
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   Like there--
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.000]   There's no way to delegate this.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.400]   Like there's one Facebook login that Verizon has, right?
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.040]   All the messages go to this one dude.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   Oh, no, they'll believe me.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   Facebook will figure this out.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   How do you keep messaging from going down the same road?
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.120]   Email went.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.880]   Email was all of this and great.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.160]   And then because there was so much of it and so many--
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   And the problem with email is anybody can send you an email.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.760]   As soon as anybody can send you a message,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.400]   how do you keep this from becoming email?
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.200]   As long as if it becomes sender controlled, it's doomed.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.960]   Dude.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.520]   If it's recipient controlled, that's where Google+--
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.120]   Ah, remember Google+-- that's where Google+ had an advantage.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.000]   This is the MyKelken argument about NoSpam
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.560]   is because it was recipient controlled.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   But it wasn't universal.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.520]   Lord knows.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.200]   So Google had a plan.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.120]   Yeah, they had an architecture to beat them.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.600]   But we need to rethink--
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.120]   we're saying messages taken over the world,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   messages taken over the world.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.600]   Well, yeah, but it's not really thought out yet.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.400]   No, and it could end up just like email, which was the last thing
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.880]   to take over the world.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   It could.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.280]   A permissioned messenger system with universal identity.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.800]   We don't have.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.680]   Permissioned.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.240]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.840]   I mean, phone wasn't that because, of course, you could get junk calls.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.960]   And that's why legislation was then enacted to get rid of that.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.840]   So it was sender controlled to that extent.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   But the recipient controlled the extent
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.480]   that you could decide not to answer the number.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   And do you want to go to Verizon or Comcast
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.600]   and have a persistent conversation with him living in your messaging?
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.440]   At all.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.920]   No, I don't think so.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.120]   But a little bubble showing up.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.320]   How you doing today, Jeff?
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.520]   You want to buy another service?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.640]   No.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.440]   Yeah, that's spam.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.320]   I'm trying to buy the car, as you know, on the show.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.080]   And I went and did the Costco and the USAA car thing.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.440]   So now I'm getting non-- I'm not ready yet, folks.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   I'm not ready.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.640]   I'm going to go up and go up.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.080]   Non-stop call.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.640]   It's a nice box.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.440]   So no, you don't want to open up to brands where they have
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.680]   to control the communication.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.960]   No.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.480]   Ron, what do you use for-- do you do messaging?
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.360]   I mean, I'm kind of forced to use Facebook Messenger,
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.240]   because that's what people kind of contact me on.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.840]   But I--
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.200]   You know everybody's going to be on that.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.160]   I try to use Hangouts as much as possible.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.360]   I prefer that.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.320]   And that's because you're an Android user.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.520]   And Hangouts makes a lot of sense for Hangouts,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.360]   but for an Android.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.720]   Well, it's not just that.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.800]   I have a Mac and Windows desktop.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.920]   And I can get Hangouts on all of that stuff
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.480]   as a background app that runs everywhere.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.760]   And when you message me on Hangouts,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.720]   all of my devices beep.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.760]   And sometimes that's like 15 devices depending
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.760]   on how busy I am right now.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.040]   Where Facebook Messenger, because I'm not automatically
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.080]   logged into it, because it's not on any of my desktops,
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.960]   like one phone somewhere beeps.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.800]   And I'm a lot slower to respond to Facebook Messenger
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.640]   than anything else.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.400]   Hangouts is a-- right now is a Chrome widget,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.240]   which means you have to have Chrome running for Hangouts
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.280]   to work on your desktop.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.200]   Should they make a standalone app?
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.440]   No, so the two different Chrome extensions
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.520]   that are there run in the background.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   Even if Chrome's not running.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.600]   Right.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.000]   Even if a Chrome window is not running Chrome,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.120]   if it's on your computer, is usually running all the time.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.040]   That's your computer.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   But if I close Chrome, I don't get Hangout messages.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.640]   Hangouts messages.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.080]   Yeah, you will.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.480]   If you installed the extension--
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.160]   If you have the--
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.560]   If you sold it, yes.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.040]   OK.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   Well, Hangouts.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.480]   I'll just say--
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.080]   There's also Hangouts.google.com, and it's in Gmail.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.920]   And is it still in Google+,?
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.600]   It is in Gmail.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.520]   It used to be in Google+.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.480]   But I feel like they need a native app for these platforms
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.240]   as well.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.360]   I like having a native app.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.160]   Google doesn't have native app for anything.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.720]   I know.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.840]   They don't go that way.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.080]   They don't--
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.800]   It's just Chrome.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.000]   And Chrome is--
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.160]   It's not how Google rules.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.600]   --that they build on now.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.840]   I really like Telegram still.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.080]   And I wish that Google would buy them.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.680]   So Google tried to buy the company behind the Telegram
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.040]   chatbot service, which is called 200 Labs.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.160]   And don't Google that because you won't find anything I tried.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.960]   But they tried to buy that company, and they said no.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.880]   So it's the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia that started this.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.120]   He was and chased from Russia.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.640]   OK.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.800]   It was an amazing guy.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.800]   Pavel Durov, D-U-R-O-V.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.320]   He's going to let us know where now.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:40.360]   Well, because basically Putin forced the sale of his company
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.720]   to the government.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.440]   But he got some money out of it.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.200]   He founded the social networks, say VK.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.600]   And then he and his brother-- it was a mathematician
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   created Telegram.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.640]   And I can't remember what country telegrams out of.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.560]   It's not out of Russia.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.760]   None of them are in Russia anymore.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   V-contact.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.600]   V-contact, yeah.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.240]   V-contact.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.160]   So some people might say, well, I don't really trust a guy who
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.600]   has connections with Putin.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.760]   But I think it's the opposite.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.680]   I think it's the opposite.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.480]   Because of Russian Federal Security Service
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.560]   said you must hand over personal details of users.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.200]   He said no.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.360]   It was not much of a future in that.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.520]   Yuri Milmer, if I'm correct, I think Yuri
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.760]   made his beginning of his fortune with mail down
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.120]   are you and be like, be contact?
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.640]   I think he was a Pavel mentor, as I remember.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.720]   And Yuri, I think, is also out of Russia.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.040]   So interesting.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.640]   So Telegram, which I think really is mostly run
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.240]   by his brother, Nikolai, said no to Google.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.760]   It's 200 labs, which is the company behind Telegram's chat
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.320]   bot service or technology or something like that.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   They do the chat bots.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.680]   That's not Telegram.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.160]   That's right.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.760]   I remember reading that.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.280]   By the way, Telegram's open source.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.280]   So anybody can write a Telegram client,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.800]   which is another brilliant move.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.600]   Telegram could be the next Android.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.440]   And I could really easily see Google snapping it up and saying,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.520]   all right, we've got a platform.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.480]   I'll be interested.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.320]   Well, but, but Leo, this all gets superseded.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.880]   You know what takes over at all.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.760]   But peach.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   Ha ha.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.880]   Peach is so last week.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.160]   And so I really, for about 10 minutes,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.200]   was excited about Peach.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.920]   I thought, finally, something they can kill Twitter.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.120]   Then I decided a lot of them.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.800]   I said that was completely-- I must have been drunk.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.760]   Oh.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.560]   Hangouts is good.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.520]   If Google put all of its efforts behind it,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.440]   I'm sad that they killed the XMPP, the Jabber backbone that
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.480]   was for Google Talk.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.040]   Because maybe I'm not technical enough
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.360]   to understand the issues with it.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.160]   But it was my feeling that that had some real future
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.880]   as a standard.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   The reason I care about this is because if Facebook is about
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.320]   to win-- and we've talked about this before.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.960]   I really-- I think Dave is saying, here's
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.280]   what we're going to do.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.160]   But messenger is successful because it got built into Facebook.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.440]   It got that bump of initial users.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.480]   And whatever Google builds could do the same thing just
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.400]   by building it into Android and into Gmail and all that stuff.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.280]   Which everybody hates on Google+ for doing.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.080]   But if you want to win messaging right now,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.040]   that's what you have to do.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.000]   You have to say, we're just going to push this out to all
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.680]   our users and hope that they--
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.480]   And make a strong apple client.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.240]   And make a strong apple client, an iOS client.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.480]   Because you've got to work on iOS, too.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.240]   This is the fundamental mistake Apple's making,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.400]   which is that because their messenger client is Apple only,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.840]   they can never win.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.360]   Like Barry, man.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.240]   Like Barry.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.160]   They thought-- they thought BBM was going to do.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.840]   They thought they had it.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.560]   They thought they'd win.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.800]   Yeah, in certain small groups they did.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.200]   But they didn't win the big thing.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.560]   When we come back, I want to talk about Remix.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.720]   Because you talk about Android everywhere.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.160]   We've been talking for a long time about the Pixel C
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.800]   and how Google kind of fumbled what
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.160]   could have been a world-changing product.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   We continue with the roadmap for 2016, the 2016 Google
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.080]   Tracker, Rana Madio at ours, Technica.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.640]   You want to follow along in the playbook,
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.360]   goodarstechnica.com.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.960]   And Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.080]   I showed you they brought you by Credit Karma, a free app.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.760]   A free app that is going to tell you something very important,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.880]   a number that counts a lot more than your weight,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.360]   more than your blood pressure, more than your--
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.600]   it's your credit score.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.320]   Credit Karma.com-- 45 million people
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.400]   have now joined Credit Karma.com.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.760]   Because they need to know their credit score.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.600]   Your credit score is what determines everything.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.440]   Many of the websites that offer credit reports are confusing
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.960]   and worse come with fees, hidden fees.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.920]   I went to one that said it was free, it wasn't.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   Credit Karma does things differently.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.200]   They offer truly free credit reports
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.080]   with no strings attached and no credit card required.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.320]   They couldn't charge you if they wanted to.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.360]   They don't just show you a score and send you away.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.880]   They actually break it down so you can see what actions
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.520]   have affected that score, what things you could do to improve it,
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.960]   and to make their services even easier to access,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.080]   they have the free mobile apps on the iOS and Android.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.400]   45 million members turned to Credit Karma
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.480]   to check their credit score.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.000]   Why aren't you, is the question.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.240]   This is free free, as in it costs nothing free.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.080]   Credit Karma.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   Get it right now on your phone or go to credit karma.com
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.840]   to find out more.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.640]   You may not get to those ab crunches in your New Year's
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.440]   resolution, but this is a good one that'll help you.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   If you're more comfortable and confident
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.080]   about your financial fitness, get your free credit report
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.680]   today, credit karma.com.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.640]   We were playing before the show, and I guess I should show it,
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.240]   with this thing that just came out, remix OS.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.600]   And you have a piece of hardware run
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   that they sent you that runs remix OS.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.840]   But you can download it from jid.com and install it
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.400]   on a USB key and then run it on any laptop.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.000]   They say some Macs, some Windows boxes.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.600]   On my Dell, I'm running it on a Dell,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.880]   but I had to, in order to get to work on the Dell,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.320]   turn off UEFI and secure boot and all of that.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.080]   Now it's going to sleep.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.640]   Yeah, you need a 64-bit computer and a bunch of weird other
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.160]   settings that might work and might not.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   It's based on the Android x86 project, which has been going
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.920]   on for a really long time.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.080]   Is that a Google project or is that an open source?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.360]   It's a big open source project.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.240]   It actually started before the whole official Intel support
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.920]   thing started from Google.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.600]   So if you go there, there is a hardware compatibility list,
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.640]   which should apply to most of remix as well.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.240]   But apparently, the little tiny box that I got
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.960]   has a lot of differences.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.000]   There's a lot of differences between that software
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.640]   and the software that you can download.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.840]   I don't have Google services, for instance, on this.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.680]   Right, yeah, the biggest of which is apparently
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.600]   all the Google apps.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   And you can't change your resolution.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.360]   And I totally could.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.520]   But that's not really the point.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.560]   This is not-- and they even say it on the website.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.520]   Look, don't expect a usable operating system.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.920]   But what's interesting is they're showing a very clear path
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.120]   to making Android a desktop operating system, something
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.360]   that, for instance, would really be great on the Pixel
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.400]   C Google.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.080]   In fact, that was the first thing you asked,
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   Jeff, is can I put it on my Pixel C?
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.240]   But you can't, because this is an ARM device,
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.560]   and that's really x86.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.480]   It's designed for x86.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.960]   But there's no-- I suspect that that's what Google was working
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.800]   on, and they couldn't get going in time to get it out
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.080]   for the C. Right, Ron?
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.040]   I mean, wasn't that the rumor?
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.000]   The rumor is they want to merge Chrome and Android
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.120]   and kind of turn Android into a desktop operating system.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.520]   And remix is kind of a third party's idea
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.960]   of what that would look like.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   With menu bar and--
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.040]   Yeah, it's designed for a mouse and keyboard, though,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.000]   and the Pixel C has no mouse.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.680]   So as much of a wonderful dream as that would be,
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.160]   it would probably not be that great.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.560]   I don't know if you need a mouse.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.200]   It could plug an external mouse into the Pixel C.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.760]   You could use a mouse, but I think touch
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.120]   does everything a mouse would do, doesn't it?
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.080]   Because right click is long press.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.240]   The big advantages are things like selecting text.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.360]   And just whenever you're typing in one like fiddle
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.400]   with whatever sentence--
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.680]   Easier with a mouse.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.720]   It's horrible with touch.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.840]   And yeah, with a mouse, it's really nice.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.040]   And remix adds some of that to some of the Google Apps.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.440]   It turns out that all the Google Apps
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.280]   and most other Android apps all implement text fields
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.400]   in different ways.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.240]   So you get all sorts of wacky consistencies,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.920]   where sometimes you'll get that little like eye-shaped mouse
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.800]   cursor thing that blinks and you can highlight text.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.960]   And then some of them-- it just works like a finger tap.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.480]   And you don't get the fun mouse highlighting.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.240]   So it's a really weird operating system.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:40.880]   What's wrong with it?
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.680]   Is it broken?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.640]   It went to sleep, and I can't wake it up.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.320]   So the box would do that too.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.880]   And you just have to kill power and start it over from scratch.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.040]   So pull the batteries.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.600]   See if that works.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.560]   Can you pull the battery in that thing?
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.560]   Hold down power forever.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.280]   That's memories.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.120]   You can't do that anymore.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.640]   No, I can do it.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   I just press the office button.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   Oh, see, some comes up.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.600]   And then that's all I see.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.560]   And now I'll just power down and reboot.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.080]   I'm booting off from a USB key.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.800]   So this is not the--
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.720]   But this is the story of RemixOS.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.160]   It is not super stable.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.240]   It's not really done.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.720]   It's very hacky.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   But it's fun to play with for a few minutes.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.960]   Yeah, I don't think it's a product.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.480]   But it's more this shows the way.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.040]   I think for one desktop--
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.360]   Android could be.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.400]   I'm about to go out of town.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.800]   And so I'm now stupidly carrying the pixels--
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.080]   Which one do I have here?
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.480]   The Pixel C at the same--
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.160]   So I have--
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.320]   And the Chromebook.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.840]   The little laces flip.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.200]   Do I have a Chromebook?
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.960]   Because sometimes when I'm working on a text or something,
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.520]   you need the Chromebook.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.600]   But this little one is slow.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.200]   But I don't really want to carry my huge Chromebook
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.920]   Pixel for 10 days out of town.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.280]   And it's tried to be nuts as to which one am I using now
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.080]   and why am I using it?
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.000]   And switching back and forth.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.120]   I haven't come to any grand conclusions yet.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.640]   But it's frustrating that these two OASs are coming closer
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.680]   together, but there's still a gulf between them.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.240]   Well, Android really isn't a suitable for desktop work.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.320]   That's really cool.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.960]   One of the things I found interesting when I tried that out
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.360]   is on an Android tablet.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.880]   When you have a phone app, it really sucks.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.240]   You're bummed out.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.920]   And there's this giant phone app that stretches outside ways.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.840]   And it's a big pain to use.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.440]   But when you have a windowed operating system,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.280]   if you have a phone app, it's not that bad,
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.640]   because the phone app just sits in a little box this way.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.560]   And you just kind of use it at the--
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   because it's the size it was intended to be,
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.920]   using it is not the agony that an Android tablet is safe.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.760]   If Facebook's right and it's the end of the phone number,
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.160]   it's probably the end of the phone.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.880]   You still need a personal communication device.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.320]   Right.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.560]   Regardless of what you want to call it.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.320]   It's a personal communicator.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.760]   It doesn't have to be phone size.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.640]   A Pixel C could be your personal communicator.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.040]   Especially if we go wireless, which Apple's
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.800]   going to push forward, because apparently they're
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.120]   removing the headphone jack from the next iPhone.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.840]   So all your headphones and everything
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.600]   are going to be wireless.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:21.760]   Now you all need to carry a man purse, all your men,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.000]   because you need to carry bigger devices in your carry-all
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.120]   and have your buds or your wearable,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.600]   or I guess it could be your watch.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:31.920]   Or your--
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.640]   Yeah, I mean, as somebody that's had Bluetooth headphones
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.960]   for years and years and prefer them,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.840]   the one sucky thing is that they're all huge,
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   because they take batteries.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.200]   And you've got to charge them all the time,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.840]   because they take batteries.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.720]   So your typical pack away stuff goes from-- instead
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.000]   of having the little corded headphone,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.720]   you've got to bring your bulky headphones and the charger
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.280]   for them and the charger for your phone
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.000]   and the charger for your laptop.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.240]   And yeah, it's rough.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.200]   We need USB-C everything.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.040]   We're getting there.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.920]   We're getting closer and closer.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.840]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.760]   So now carrying power on this trip,
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.920]   it got more complicated again.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.000]   I mean, it's headed in the right direction.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.520]   But for a while, it's a pain.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.040]   What you need is what I have here.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.640]   I showed this on MacBreak Weekly.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.040]   This is from a company called Zolt.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.960]   Z-O-L-T, I can't remember the website,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.320]   is Get Zolt or something like that.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.920]   This is a charger, very compact charger,
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.560]   that comes with--
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.760]   I don't know if they have a USB Type-C connector.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.120]   But it is a laptop charger, the capable of 65 watts.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.760]   And then it has two additional smaller USBs.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.600]   So you could charge everything from this.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.240]   So you could have a USB-C cable coming off of this.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.680]   They have-- they sent it--
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.360]   I didn't buy it.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.720]   They sent it with a Mac compatible laptop charger.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.480]   So you plug that in, you're charging your Mac.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.160]   Was that MagSafe?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.840]   They offer MagSafe tips.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.760]   Oh, that's super not legal, I'd imagine.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.200]   Apple doesn't--
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.440]   No, I'm sure they licensed this.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.240]   This looks licensed.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.280]   OK.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.240]   I know.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   Apple doesn't-- I know.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.320]   I've never seen one do this.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.000]   It's so hard to get MagSafe.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.920]   I love MagSafe.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.960]   I'm really bummed that they put USB Type-C on Macbooks.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.600]   But it's really hard to get MagSafe stuff.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.080]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.360]   I always end up getting it on eBay from China.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:32.880]   Right.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.120]   It's illegal MagSafe.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.440]   Yeah, illegal fire hazards.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.560]   Kind of like an illegal man.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.440]   It's the other one.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.280]   So this you plug in.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.960]   Now, it's not going to charge your MacBook as fast
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:49.000]   as an Apple charger will, because it's only I think 65 watts.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.520]   And if you have-- it's total.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.720]   So if you have-- but you could trickle charge a phone.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.680]   You could do a tablet.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.000]   So that's what you need, Jeff.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And it's pretty compact.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.280]   And then it all wraps up into a little thing.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   And what you need is a USB-C cable as well.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.400]   That's got to stick really far out of whatever
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.720]   electrical socket you plug into.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.320]   Yeah, but it rotates, which is nice.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.440]   So you can manage to get it somewhere.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.880]   OK.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:19.440]   But just-- can it not stick a foot out of the wall
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.680]   or however long that is?
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.200]   Because just a lot of the planes and hotel rooms
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.840]   and stuff that I end up on that would be in the way.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.520]   I want like a wire at the end of it
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.440]   that I can plug in and then the little box can dangle somewhere.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.280]   Just bring an extension cord.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   Yeah, bring a little extension cord with you.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.240]   This isn't that far.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.800]   This is four and a half, five inches.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   OK.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.520]   Yeah, this is kind of cool, huh?
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.640]   It's 100 bucks.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.080]   It's a result.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.960]   See, go like that.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.600]   That's not too far out.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.480]   That can sit on the wall.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.960]   So with a USB-C, I could charge my new Pixel?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.880]   Wow.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.560]   And your phone.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.480]   And your Google Glass.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.000]   That was cool.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.840]   It was mean of you.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.600]   Your phone, your laptop, your headphones,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.880]   your watch, your Google Glasses.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.400]   You need more of these.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.960]   But yeah, I think it's all going to go Type C.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.600]   And then it'll be easier.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.520]   Life will be.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.800]   Because that's a standard.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.240]   This is the really silly thing.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.320]   This comes from the era when you had to have different tips
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.480]   for every laptop.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.680]   So it comes with like 10 tips.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.560]   These little silly tips.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.480]   And then a special kind of cable that goes into the tips.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.320]   It's really crazy.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.400]   Oh, God, I remember those days.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.000]   Ever that?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.520]   Oh.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.880]   Type C, please.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.360]   Please.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.560]   And the Asus takes what?
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.760]   A regular-- takes a special plug?
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.680]   It takes a special plug that looks like a USB, but it's not.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   Jesus.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.880]   I don't know if they'll-- they think they'll have a tip for it.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.360]   And if they did, then this would be a good solution for you.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.920]   I love Chrome OS.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.680]   And I think that Android could be--
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.320]   I mean, this remix kind of gave me renewed vigor
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.920]   around the idea of a desktop Android.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.840]   Yeah, it's coming.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.200]   They're making it.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.760]   Yeah, you say that in the room map.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.120]   You say 2017, but you say they will do this.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.200]   Yeah, the preview version is supposed to be out this year.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.880]   I would guess it happens at Google I/O where they say,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.400]   here's the desktop stuff that we have so far.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.960]   And developers are kind of going to need to wrap their head
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.520]   around it and start making desktop apps.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.360]   And they'll hopefully get feedback.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.000]   Because that's kind of the pattern now where Google comes up
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.200]   with this new thing and they release it at I/O and everybody
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.560]   gets to play with it for six months in a developer preview.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.120]   Like, I think they've realized that secrecy is not
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.560]   super important anymore.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.760]   And they're more interested in having a beta and getting
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.280]   stuff right.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.640]   Sundar Pachay had made the announcement.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.480]   He says, I/O 16, coming to the neighborhood where it all
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.680]   started 10 years ago, Shoreline Amphitheater.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.360]   So it wasn't going to be tense.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.680]   I was hoping to talk to you about this, Leo, as someone
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.600]   from California, have you ever been to?
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.520]   Oh, yeah, many times.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.560]   It's a concert venue.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   They got a nice lawn area.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.120]   OK, so how does food work?
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.720]   How does hotels work?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.760]   Because if you look on Google Maps for everybody else,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.480]   there's a Shoreline Amphitheater.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.600]   And then it's like Google all around it, like just
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.680]   thousands of buildings.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.360]   And then above it is the ocean.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.240]   And it's like, I don't know, it's
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.120]   like trying to get stuff done in the middle of Disneyland
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.600]   or something.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.160]   There's--
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:45.640]   I think--
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.080]   And the hotels on the peninsula are just--
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.560]   are few and awful.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.480]   Well, it's not the city, by any means.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.200]   It would be fine for a keynote, because it's a big venue.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.000]   I mean, you could--
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.400]   I don't know, 10,000 people.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.080]   I don't know, off to the list.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.880]   But it doesn't have conference facilities.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.800]   So all those breakouts, will that be back
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.280]   at the Google campus, maybe?
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.160]   It would have to be.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   That's probably what I'm thinking, is that--
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.680]   yeah, there's-- what is that?
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.160]   But security.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.040]   There's the amphitheater.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.960]   See, in the nice lawn area--
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.560]   It's 2000, well, I guess, including the lawn.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.000]   $22,500.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.600]   That's including the lawn, yeah, $22,500.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.680]   A $6500 reserve seats--
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.520]   $16,000.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.840]   That's probably what they'll use.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.120]   And maybe they'll set up table.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.960]   Now, but the lawn's sloped.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.680]   And then above that is--
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.600]   About rain.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.040]   And from there south, all the way down to the highway,
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.280]   is just nonstop Google buildings.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.600]   And they're all high security, because they're Google buildings.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.640]   Like, you can walk around outside.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.080]   But--
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.320]   Well, maybe the parking lot.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:45.800]   I don't know.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.240]   I don't know how they do the breakouts stuff.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:56.000]   Yeah, so the theory, since it's like a semi-outside venue,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.800]   the theories is like, oh, the Willy Wonka factory
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.720]   will be in full effect.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.360]   And they'll have--
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   So drive your cars, come out and get you.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.160]   And you'll go to the venue and they'll have all these--
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.440]   Oh, I want a golden ticket.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.400]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.360]   Just that it's outside the theory is there's
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.240]   going to be lots of cars without lots of drone stuff.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.880]   That's a lot of that theory.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.360]   Which, I mean, they could make all that stuff electric
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.920]   and do it at Moscone to, I would--
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.480]   maybe, I don't know.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.120]   But the car theory is interesting.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.480]   May 18th, 19th, and 20th.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.560]   Well, that's longer than usual, right?
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.000]   No.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.480]   Three days.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:33.920]   Three days.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   Now, it used to be-- it was three,
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.720]   and then it went to two, and now it's back to three again.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.480]   So it's slightly longer, which is cool.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.200]   And if our tickets will be hard to get,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.120]   they haven't announced how that's going to work yet.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.080]   Ridiculous, even a week before we're not sure
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.200]   what's going to be announced.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.760]   But nonetheless, Ron, you've suggested one thing that's
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.200]   going to be Google I/O. What else do you think might be
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.360]   coming to Google I/O?
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.760]   What's percolate?
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.280]   Oh, this is going to be a good year for I/O, don't you think?
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.000]   I think so.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.480]   I think so.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.840]   I mean, I/O lately has really turned into the Android show.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.120]   So they will have a new version of Android.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.400]   I think it's just a question of whether it is Android N, which
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.680]   they keep talking about, or this Android Chrome hybrid,
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.760]   or if they're the same thing.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.680]   Like I said, I think that the Chrome Android version comes out
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.520]   at I/O because that's what the Wall Street Journal report said.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   It's like it's coming out in 2016.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.600]   Oh, and now I/O makes sense.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   I don't think it's the end of the year.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.440]   Because you want to get people developing for it
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.440]   before you shoot it.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.600]   And then you want to have a bunch of talks about how
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.360]   to do all this new desktop stuff.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.160]   And it's not just--
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.920]   it's all this logistical stuff they
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.680]   want to talk to developers about.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.160]   So they can tell them how to implement a right click menu
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.200]   correctly.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.000]   But Cenor Pichai was the Chrome OS guy.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.760]   Why would he--
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.200]   I mean, if you make an Android desktop, doesn't that--
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.080]   I mean, it's Chrome--
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.480]   or you're going to merge them, right?
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:55.920]   Or what?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.120]   I don't understand.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.480]   Yeah, the idea is you take the best of Chrome and Android
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.520]   and mash them together.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.000]   Hopefully that means they work on a ground up revamp of Android
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.320]   where they fix the update situation and all of that stuff.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.040]   And mostly, I think mostly it's Android attacking
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.080]   a new form factor, which is the PC.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.040]   I mean, they've already got it running on phones and tablets
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.480]   and cars and watches and televisions.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.920]   So going to PCs seems like a pretty obvious step
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   when it runs on everything else on Earth.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.800]   And then other than that, this is the first I/O
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.400]   since the whole alphabet thing happens.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.160]   So who knows what they're--
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.960]   who else wants to show up to the party
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.240]   or if they want to--
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:41.740]   Oh.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.480]   --to the alphabet I/O.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.720]   So that's not a--
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.680]   well, that's a question.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.520]   Is it a Google I/O?
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.600]   Cenor Pichai announced it.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.440]   This is--
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   Cenor announced it.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.280]   This is Google alone.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.640]   Everything else is a separate company.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.560]   Yeah, and mostly everything else is not a commercial product.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.720]   There's Nest, and then everything else
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.000]   is investments in super deep research.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.520]   And--
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.880]   But they might have some people show up just to--
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.320]   no announcements, but show up to just
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.920]   wow the journalists and developers.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   I think we'll have breakout sessions
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.360]   and self-driving buses.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.600]   There's always bar tending robots and all this other weird stuff
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.960]   there that I'm sure people--
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.360]   oh, robots, there we go.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.040]   All the Boston Dynamics stuff.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.680]   They could have their little robot dogs.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.640]   Would you like to ride a dog back
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.960]   to your breakout session?
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.160]   Yeah, with like their broke gasoline engines,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:34.880]   it sounded like--
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.440]   [SQUEALING]
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.520]   Yeah, that'll be great.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.720]   Nice and peaceful.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.240]   Why hasn't--
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.320]   F8 is really more of a developer's--
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:45.720]   --developer of a company.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.880]   --face books, right?
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.080]   Right.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   Well, that's because Facebook is a software company.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.920]   It's a purely a software company.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.080]   So what made Google I/O different?
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.400]   Was it back then there was hardware?
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.160]   And they were giving it away.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.920]   Different in terms of what?
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.240]   Just the kind of excitement and the rest that happens around it.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.040]   I mean, physical stuff's always more interesting.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.520]   Notice that all the coverage is always
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.640]   of the stuff in the lobby, the physical--
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.160]   Yeah, you did pictures of it.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.960]   Software is so abstract, it's really hard to talk about.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.400]   Well, I mean, it's a cool strategy where you kind of--
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.600]   There's the dog.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.160]   You get developers excited about everything that's happening.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.240]   And then at the same time say, oh, you're excited about this?
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.960]   You can learn about how to do it right now.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.840]   Make your app today that they can do all that.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.240]   But also just that they invite the press.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.360]   I mean, Google had the Ubiquity Conference this week
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.040]   about the internet of things.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.520]   And they talked about Weave and Burlow and all that other stuff.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.600]   And nobody cares because they didn't invite the press
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.920]   or really hype it up or--
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.800]   We didn't even cover it.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.200]   Yeah, and it was a hardcore developer conference.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.680]   It was streamed online.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   You can watch it.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.120]   It's like nitty gritty tech details.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.800]   Like Google has for real developer conferences all the time.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.680]   And they have design conferences now, too.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.800]   But just I/O is the Super Bowl.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.600]   And it's cool to have a show like that.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.080]   But it's not the only developer show.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.160]   Tell us about Timeful.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.440]   Timeful was-- what was that?
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.000]   That was-- it was something that they acquired.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Yeah, it was AI-- calendar AI company.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.640]   Oh, right.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.200]   OK, so this thing would scan your schedule.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.160]   And so you would tell it what you want to do.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.080]   Like, I want to work out three times this week.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.280]   And it would look at your schedule and--
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.880]   Make it so.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.080]   Say, you have time here, here, and here,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.560]   where you could do your workouts.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   Oh, I would hate that.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.440]   I can't imagine that.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.160]   I have enough people nagging you to do things I haven't done.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.200]   No, Leo.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.320]   You really could be working on it right now.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.160]   But also the idea that my entire life is in my calendar,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   which it is not--
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.120]   the important stuff is in my calendar.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.880]   Mostly the work stuff is in my calendar.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.800]   But if it's like, I'm going to go to dinner with a friend,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.480]   like, I don't need to put that in a calendar.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.640]   I'm going to remember.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.560]   And it's like this--
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.000]   it takes this weird view of the world
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.160]   where your entire life is in your calendar.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.960]   And I think for most people, that's not true.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.800]   No, you're right.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.960]   It's in my messenger.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.400]   Yeah, if it could scan that and figure stuff out.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:22.760]   I'm looking--
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.280]   I shared my calendar with a couple of colleagues
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.200]   so they can--
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:26.880]   I do that.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.480]   Lisa has my calendar, yeah.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.680]   So I put it--
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.200]   so my colleagues came to me, they said, well,
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.400]   you have this big-- this thing is going on for five days.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.880]   Like the phooboo thing with it.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.160]   I said, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.520]   I don't like how it's not there.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.320]   I realized there's that horrible thing where people can
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.840]   put something on your calendar without your permission.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.680]   And I turned that off.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.560]   But now there's stuff appearing on my calendar
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.440]   to other people that I'm not actually doing.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.040]   Yeah, a lot of times Google will scan your Gmail now and say,
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.480]   oh, someone invited you to this.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.200]   So we put it on your calendar for you.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.360]   You're welcome.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.200]   And sometimes--
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.440]   Right, you're talking about if you add invitations
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.040]   to my calendar.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.400]   And I said, no, only the information I responded to.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.560]   However, it was showing them to other people.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.760]   Oh, oh, wow.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.560]   OK.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   That's weird.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.160]   So what app was that?
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.240]   Because Gmail does it.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.440]   And I'm sure there's like a Google--
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.240]   I'm sure there's multiple things that do that.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.720]   No one's--
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.600]   I can't see it because it's not me.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.840]   Anyway.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.040]   So the thing on this list I'm excited about
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.520]   is the virtual reality stuff, which they just announced.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.240]   They just-- yeah, they re-orged around it, didn't they?
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.480]   Yeah, they just kind of made the division official.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   And they have a guy running it now
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.680]   or a different person running it.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.440]   I don't know if somebody was running it before.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.360]   John Wight, is it John Wily, who is--
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.440]   He's in the division.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   He's in the team.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.600]   There's this thing about it.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.360]   Google does cardboard today, which really seems like a joke.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.920]   I mean, it's a product, but it just seems like it's not
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.080]   a really serious product that anybody's ever
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.560]   going to fall in love with.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.280]   But the amount of people working in the Google VR team
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.960]   is really just stunning.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.520]   The MVPs of Google have kind of left to go work on this.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.960]   So John Wily, who used to run Google Search--
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.240]   he used to be the lead designer for Google Search.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.800]   So Google Search is like a billion users every day.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.560]   You leave that to go work on a piece of cardboard.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.440]   And then Alex Fobborg--
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.320]   I don't know how to say his last name-- but he was the lead
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.400]   developer for Firefox, or the lead designer for Firefox,
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.040]   and was a designer on Chrome.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   And he left to go work on the virtual reality team, too.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.120]   And it's like all these people aren't going to leave their
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.360]   super awesome jobs where they deal with millions of users
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.680]   every day to go work on a weird side project.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.200]   So--
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.720]   And then Clay Baver, who is VP for product management, he was
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.680]   the guy in charge of Gmail, Drive, and Docs.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.280]   He, as I said, also oversaw Google cardboard.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.160]   So he's going to be all about VR.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   And then the one report--
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.440]   And then Diane Green is now getting the apps division.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.320]   She's a relatively newcomer.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.120]   She's from VMware.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.360]   And she was going to run their enterprise.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.600]   They want to make a new enterprise division or something
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.960]   where all their cloud services end up under one thing.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.560]   Nobody really knows what's going on with that yet.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.880]   According to a recode, Google's suffering from FOMO, the fear
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.560]   of missing Oculus.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.920]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.440]   I feel like Microsoft, Google, Facebook with Oculus all have
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.560]   been working on VR for some time.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.680]   I think Google cardboard was a clever strategy because it
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.000]   popularized it.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.600]   But now Google has an official VP for virtual reality.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.320]   And I think that that--
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.280]   the problem is Google shifts its gaze all the time.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.160]   And it's hard to say, oh, now they're really going to be in it.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.520]   Because--
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.400]   Yeah, it's just the people work in there are really important,
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:02.680]   though.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.040]   And I don't know.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.720]   Fear of missing Oculus is interesting because I picture
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.280]   Oculus as a hardware company.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.640]   And this Google division is going to be really focused
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.400]   on software.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.520]   I think there's been a Wall Street Journal report
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.440]   from a long time ago that said these guys were all building
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.880]   an Android--
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.000]   a version of Android for virtual reality.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.240]   So kind of the virtual reality operating system, where
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.800]   right now with an Oculus Rift and all that other stuff,
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.960]   you kind of bounce in and out of--
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.360]   you have your mouse and keyboard and you start the Oculus app.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.760]   And then you put your headset on.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.800]   And then you go into your virtual reality world.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.720]   But there's really nothing that lets you
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.600]   live in virtual reality or do productive stuff or anything
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:50.920]   like that.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.240]   You just bounce in and out from one video game to another,
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.160]   really.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:55.680]   Did I--
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.520]   Did you see no--
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.640]   Sorry, Ron.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.480]   Go ahead, finish.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.000]   Sorry.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.360]   To have Google do software would just be important, I think,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.960]   because nobody's doing the software right now.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.520]   And I think that's what Cardboard is.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.160]   It's a developer kit to say, this is what VR is like.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.880]   And this is the kind of stuff you can
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.320]   be able to get used to it.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.480]   And something better will come out later.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.320]   Well, and BayVore has pointed his tweets about the CNN story
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.840]   about the surgeon using Cardboard.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.560]   I don't know really--
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.960]   I mean, he saved a baby's life.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.880]   I'm not saying it at all.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:30.280]   But we've seen this actually--
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.800]   in other-- we had a guy on the new screen savers who
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.600]   makes 3D models of infant hearts so that a doctor can
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.640]   practice the operation, play with the operation,
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.280]   study the heart before he goes in.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.240]   And this is kind of a similar application
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.000]   because they were able to look at the surgery ahead of time.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.320]   They could kind of understand where they were going
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.200]   and not be surprised.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.000]   He's also wearing a Fitbit gear.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.880]   And it's obviously a very geeky doctor here.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.080]   But I mean, look, you're seeing the picture of the heart
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.640]   right now on a 2D screen.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.440]   That looks fine.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.360]   I mean, I'm no doctor, but I don't see it being in 3D.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.640]   Well, they're going to go in and under and around vessels.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.680]   He's going to have a map of it in his mind.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.640]   I mean, this is a common one.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.480]   That's what this is, yeah.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.240]   It was also--
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   Is he done by rotating the flat image around?
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.200]   Does it need to be staring--
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.440]   Well, as I said, yeah.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.320]   As I said, we also learn of the--
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.040]   making a 3D model is very helpful because they can--
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.240]   well, I'm going to go in here and do it like that.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.160]   I think that'd actually be more useful than a Google Cardboard.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.680]   I'm terrible at spatial relations and pulling things
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.880]   that which is why I would never even do an operation on you.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.480]   I feel like this story, as wonderful as it is,
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.520]   is almost a plant from Google.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.000]   It's like, look, see cardboard.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.600]   It's not just a toy.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.320]   Well, I'll give you a bet.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.960]   I just put it in the chat on the rundown, a better use.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.560]   I don't know if I've mentioned this in the show a few weeks ago
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.240]   or not.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.200]   Lowe's, the home improvement place,
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.520]   has cardboard vending machines.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.640]   Because you can see that if you're--
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.760]   oh, here's what your redesigned kitchen will look like.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.040]   And you really want to have a sense of it around.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.120]   That makes sense.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.960]   Cardboard is about spaces.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.840]   And things that make sense with spaces.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.640]   That's really cool.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.680]   So the other thing Lowe's did, actually,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.520]   is they have a Project Tango app that does the same thing.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.240]   But with Tango, because it has all of these lasers
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.880]   and measuring things on the front of it,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.920]   it's augmented reality.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.200]   So you see your kitchen, and then you
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.560]   see the refrigerator in your kitchen at the right size.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.280]   And how much space it'll take up.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.200]   And I assume you can open the door and see how much space
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.280]   all that'll take up.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:41.520]   And that's a really cool idea that's actually useful.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.560]   Here's something interesting.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.200]   Jason, the Klayanthus, our producer, pointed out to me
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.400]   out from the Google Developers blog.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.640]   Spatial audio comes to the cardboard.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.080]   And this is this part of the solution to the barf problem.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.200]   Maybe it makes--
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.600]   --that if it comes from someplace else from where you expected,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.360]   it becomes very disorienting.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.920]   Whereas if the audio gets tied to a space, as you look around
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.080]   and it starts to match with your ear,
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.200]   I think that's part of the barf problem.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.060]   Have you-- does cardboard make you
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.760]   nozzies in the same way that an Oculus does?
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.520]   I've never had an Oculus on, but cardboard,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.640]   I get a little walkie after you.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.080]   Please, yeah.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:17.880]   Yeah, I don't--
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.840]   The cardboard doesn't--
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.320]   It's hard to get nauseous in cardboard,
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.800]   because it has no head straps.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.760]   So you have to do this the whole time.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.280]   That's to me--
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.480]   And you get real tired of that after a few minutes.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.120]   Yeah, but that's the solution to me,
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.040]   is it's not as immersive.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.280]   I get wonky.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.200]   You do, OK.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.360]   I don't get nauseous, but I get--
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.520]   for about five minutes afterwards,
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.320]   I'm trying to get my bearings.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.280]   It's doing something my vertigo.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.000]   So yeah, the 3D audio thing, Google bought a company
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.680]   called Thrive Audio a couple of months ago.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.240]   So I guess that's what this is.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.680]   But again, this is more software, platform building,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.360]   and all this stuff.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.400]   Like if you want an SDK for virtual reality,
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.360]   there's really not a lot of stuff out there.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.880]   And Google, I'd imagine--
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.520]   I saw the headline for this.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.560]   I haven't really read it, but I'd imagine
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.840]   it's a bunch of SDK stuff where it's like, oh, you want
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.160]   to do 3D special audio?
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.600]   OK, we'll handle all the hard stuff.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.880]   We just stick the dot on wherever you want your--
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.400]   It's an SDK.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.720]   --audio to be.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.960]   Yeah, and we'll send that to you.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.280]   So all of that hard platform stuff, I'd imagine,
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.200]   Google's working toward.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.720]   And there is an app.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.520]   There's a demo app that you can sideload.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.320]   Over cardboard?
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   So if you want to hear how it sounds, you can.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.720]   So the other fun thing for all this virtual reality
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.520]   and augmented reality stuff is Google's
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.400]   going to make processors for all of this,
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.320]   like smartphone processors.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.640]   A report from, I'm going to guess, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.600]   Oh, no, the information.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.160]   OK, so it says that Google's--
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.120]   they've gone to chip vendors with these designs for SOCs.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.240]   And they're like, please build this.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.320]   It's for augmented reality.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.080]   Because right now, a smartphone chip
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:05.560]   is really not going to work out for VR.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.600]   You can get a gear VR and stick a Samsung smartphone
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.440]   in your little goggles.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.360]   Which I have done and have and I like.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.120]   But it does not work.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.720]   It could work a lot better.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.720]   Because smartphone processors are made for bursty applications,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.280]   where you want to take the processor and spike it
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.080]   and load your app really quickly and then come back down
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.120]   for battery savings.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.400]   Where on VR, you're going to want
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.360]   to run at full power for a much longer time
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.240]   without overheating and throttling
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.360]   and all this other heat and power related issues
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.400]   that you get on a smartphone.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.560]   So Google's going to go to these chip companies
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:52.280]   and make something that's made to be a gaming/VR/3D device
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.400]   that today's smartphone chips really aren't.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.800]   So let me ask you a related question.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.160]   It's not on the rundown.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.720]   Why is Amazon going into the chip making business?
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.760]   Amazon-- I guess for their Kindle stuff,
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.480]   I have no idea why they want to make these things.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.080]   I mean, it's servers.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   I don't know.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   That's from wondering why that-- is there nothing
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:15.880]   Amazon can't do?
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.320]   Run newspapers?
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.200]   It was that they were selling stuff, wasn't it?
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.240]   Were they selling it?
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.640]   It was like they were going to sell branded ones.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.160]   I could tell you, Apple has a huge benefit
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.840]   because it makes its own chips.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.920]   They can customize the chips to be very targeted
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.760]   to the use cases.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.560]   They're still using ARM.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   And in fact, Apple was an early investor in ARM.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.240]   But by having chip designers and they have
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.760]   repeatedly more than 1,000 chip designers on staff at Apple,
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.360]   they can make a chip that is purpose-built for the hardware.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.400]   Amazon has some great ambitions.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.920]   OK, so it says that they're designed--
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.880]   There's still ARM chips.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.000]   Media streaming devices, connected home products,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.920]   data storage gear.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.000]   I mean, I don't--
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   They bought an Israeli company called
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.360]   Anapurna Labs.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.720]   And Anapurna Labs is making these.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.400]   So maybe it's just another business.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:13.920]   I don't know.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.960]   It's more internet of things stuff than smartphone stuff
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   that's interesting.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.240]   So I mean, they make the--
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.000]   it's Alexa.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.080]   No, the Amazon Echo.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:28.120]   The Echo is kind of the surprising dark horse product
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.760]   for 2015 that really is going strong and might be even bigger
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.200]   in 2016.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.320]   They're purely making a handheld-sized Echo.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.280]   OK, yeah.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.720]   Maybe it's a smartphone flavor.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.240]   Or they want to make--
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.760]   maybe they want to make-- this all seems like really cheap stuff
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.560]   that they want to build.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.440]   So maybe it's like door locks and all of this weird internet
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.960]   of things.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.840]   Things.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.640]   It's very interesting.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:58.560]   I love it that we have people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.120]   dreaming big dreams.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   Why not?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.360]   And maybe some people at Google are doing that too.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.440]   The problem is you get to be a big company.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.120]   And the Elon Musk's of the world don't want to work there.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.520]   They just go start their own thing.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.400]   Must be challenging for a company like Google
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   to keep innovation.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.920]   Well, yeah, that was part of the plan for Alphabet
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.200]   where they just got this--
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   We'll give you a company.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.280]   --to get you a company.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.440]   Yeah, and you can be a CEO now.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.960]   But you don't have to have--
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.200]   you don't have to have investor calls.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.360]   That's not going to fool anybody.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.000]   That ain't going to fool anybody.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.480]   Come back with more.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   Ron Amadio is here from ours.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.840]   Technica, he covers the Android beat and the Google beat.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.440]   And we're talking about his roadmap for 2016 for Google.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.360]   Jeff Jarvis is also here, Professor of Journalism
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.560]   and Google--
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.120]   long time Google watcher.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.000]   According to Eric Schmidt, AI can help
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.760]   solve the world's hard problems.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.080]   So Eric Schmidt is all in on SkyNet.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.200]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.960]   First, I want to talk about standing up.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.400]   I used to do almost all my stuff stand up.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.720]   TV shows, certainly.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.840]   And the radio shows as well.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:19.320]   Because in research shows, sitting is not good for you.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.040]   And obviously, people have discovered that
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.080]   with a standing desk.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.760]   You go into any Silicon Valley enterprise.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.120]   Now, half the people are standing up.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.280]   But no, standing isn't always the right solution.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.560]   That's why I really like these varid desks.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.120]   And we have some here.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.240]   Varid desk lets you sit or stand as the occasion requires.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.040]   And what's really great about it is it'll convert your existing
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   desk to a standing desk without anybody's approval.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.200]   You don't need to get the boss to say that you don't have to tear
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.600]   out your cubicle.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.440]   Your varid desk sits right on your existing desk.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.960]   And you can have it raised or you can have it lowered.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.040]   You can stand or you can sit.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.080]   It comes fully assembled.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.680]   You just pull it out of the box, put it on your desk,
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.720]   place your monitors and your gear on it.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.200]   And there's no motor.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.520]   You can easily raise it because it's cleverly counterweighted.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.120]   So it's spring loaded.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.320]   So it makes it to come up or down easily, effortlessly.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.520]   11 different height settings and prices are very good.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.080]   Because you're not buying a whole new desk just a varid desk.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.440]   They started at $175 with free shipping
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.320]   in the continental US.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.000]   No wonder a life hacker named varid desk
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.440]   went to their five best standing desks.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.640]   It's also been featured on product hunt and gear patrol.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   We got a varid desk Pro Plus 36 at the brick house.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.160]   And people have a fight over who gets to use the varid desk.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.800]   I just love this idea.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.400]   If you've been thinking about a standing desk
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.360]   but you're not sure you want to commit
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.360]   or maybe your place of work won't let you modify your desk,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.400]   get a varid desk.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.040]   It's affordable.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.440]   It's easy.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.200]   And when you purchase one, make sure you tell them
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.320]   you heard about it on Twitter.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.560]   That's v-a-r-i-d-e-s-k.com.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.920]   V-a-r-i-desk.com.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.000]   Check it out.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.480]   It's awesome and simple.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.920]   We're talking about Google, Facebook, the cloud, all that stuff
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.840]   with Rana Modio, Jeff Jarvis, Eric Schmidt
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.600]   says that artificial intelligence will
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   let scientists solve some of the world's hard problems.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.040]   Certainly regular human intelligence hasn't helped.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.760]   Like population growth is another problem.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.440]   Climate change, human development, and education.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   AI will play this role, help scientists understand
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.960]   the links between cause and effect
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.120]   by sifting through vast amounts of information.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.080]   That makes sense, actually.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.960]   This is at a New York conference.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.760]   In the future, Eric says he would like to see Eric and not
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.480]   Eric.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.320]   Eric is the flesh and blood Schmidt.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.360]   Not Eric is the digital thing that helps me.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.720]   Eric's always been a little weird.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.600]   I haven't heard some good Eric Schmidt quotes from us.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.200]   It's been a while we missed you, Eric.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.000]   Welcome back.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.200]   AI has yet to be proven to be able to do anything,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.400]   but there's always hope.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.840]   So I try not to read too much in there anything Eric Schmidt
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.040]   says, but--
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.480]   He's just--
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.560]   But Google does a ton of machine learning stuff.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.080]   And they've-- I feel like in the past year
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.360]   maybe they've really come out hard with the machine learning
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.400]   like advert promotion, I guess you would say, where those are--
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.240]   Oh yeah, this is machine learning this and this.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.080]   So like Google Photos, you can search for stuff
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.640]   in your pictures, like not tags that you've done.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.800]   But that actually works well.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.000]   Cars, right.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.120]   And their machine learning stuff, it works well enough
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.880]   that it will show you pictures of cars in San Francisco.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.560]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.320]   You can search for that.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.480]   And like it will nail it.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.400]   It's really good.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.560]   But-- I'm going to see them next week at the--
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.040]   Davos, I can't wait to--
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:54.640]   Oh, you're going--
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.800]   Ah, no, not Eric.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.440]   Are you Eric or not Eric?
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.720]   Is it Davos time once again?
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.240]   That is.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.920]   Gosh, that comes around fast.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:10.400]   What do you think about Google's home automation ambitions?
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.200]   Because they released the on hub, which you didn't think much of.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.440]   Thank you for that review, because I immediately canceled mine.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.880]   Bought a much better router.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.480]   Smart move.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.960]   It still has not done--
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.280]   it has a constant connection to Google, and will update.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.520]   No, there's really been no significant updates yet, really.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.680]   It's just kind of an average Wi-Fi router, basically.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.480]   But $200, yeah.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:40.800]   So it has all these antennas in it that don't do a ton right now.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   But someday.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.080]   A day they will turn them on.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.240]   Like I said, they just had their internet of things
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.280]   conference this week.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.040]   And they talked about--
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.720]   so there's Brillo, which is an Android operating system
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.120]   for the internet of things.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.520]   And it's kind of neat like you get a dashboard.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.920]   So all of these internet of things stuff right now
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.680]   are really insecure.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.960]   And this gives you a dashboard just
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.480]   like on Google Play, where you can see all your devices
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.960]   and push updates out to them.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.200]   And because Google's doing the software,
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.680]   it will actually get updated.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.440]   Where like I have some smartphone stuff.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.480]   I have a smart door lock.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.440]   I have no idea what software runs.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.200]   The software has never been updated.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.720]   I'm sure there's security vulnerabilities in it.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.040]   But nobody's got to fix them because it's
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.840]   just some weird operating system that the lock company made.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.960]   Where this will kind of put security in the forefront,
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.760]   which is important if any of this internet of things stuff
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.000]   is going to actually do something.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.280]   And then they have Weave, which is like a communications
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.880]   protocol, which lets everything talk to everything else.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.760]   It's their equivalent of--
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.400]   I was thinking of threads the equivalent of ZigBee and ZWave.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:53.840]   Yeah, through that.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.400]   Weaves at a higher level than that?
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.760]   Weave is--
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.560]   It kind of abstracts everything where you say,
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.680]   you can tell a door lock, lock the door,
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.000]   rather than have to code whatever.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.480]   It's like a language to make everything.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:08.800]   Right.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.160]   So it's independent of protocol.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.280]   Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Brillo, whatever.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.880]   Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi, everything else.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.760]   What was really interesting about this conference
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   is somebody asked about thread, and they were like,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.120]   thread is the nest team.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.640]   Don't ask us about it.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.080]   That's not involved with that.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.600]   Oh, interesting.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.160]   But in the branding, it's like there's thread and weave.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.880]   And you would think that they're connected somehow
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.320]   because the branding is so similar.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.200]   But no, it's just nest to do in their nest thing.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.920]   The reason I ask about that is that protocol 802.15.4
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   is built into the on hub router.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   Right.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.800]   Which is also kind of zig-v.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.560]   And so people say Google as the company.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.560]   And the way to think about it is you look at that chart
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.320]   in the beginning of the Google tracker, those are the groups.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.920]   It's like the Google group is going to work together.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.720]   But nest is in a separate thing in Alphabet.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.920]   They're not going to work with Google.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.480]   That's never going to happen.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.920]   That level of organization does not exist.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.400]   Oh, that's so weird.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.200]   So as you write, thread originated in Nest Lab
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.680]   now lives as a product of thread group and not
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.920]   for profit organization with board members from nest,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.960]   silicon labs, NXP, ARM, and Yale residential lock.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:20.960]   So--
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.800]   You know what?
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.720]   In other words, home automation is exactly where
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.040]   it was 10 years ago.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:27.480]   A mess.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.320]   Pretty much.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.160]   So I think for that reason, thread is not going to do well.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:34.680]   Like, Brillo--
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.200]   We don't need another protocol.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.600]   Because it's Android and because it's Google.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.200]   And they'll have the scale.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.320]   Like, this will be like, we've--
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.440]   I said thread was Google.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.600]   We've is Google.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.080]   So we will be on like every Android phone.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.400]   And the scale will be there where what is the nest stuff
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:53.760]   got to do?
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.120]   It's going to be on every nest--
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.800]   And then there's a nest audio team.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.080]   Yeah, they're doing some kind of audio.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:00.760]   So maybe Sonos.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.680]   I get the Sonos clone.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.800]   No idea.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.400]   And how about Glass?
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.520]   Oh.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.760]   Google Glass.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.200]   So that is actually the second generation of Google Glass.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.360]   That's the enterprise edition that they are from the FCC
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.000]   that they are quietly shipping to businesses.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.720]   Little eyepiece is longer.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.480]   And oh, there's a little light on the camera.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.680]   See the little black dot next to the camera lens.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.000]   So there's a little recording light
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.600]   so people can tell your spine on it.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   Oh.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.120]   Oh.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.520]   And is it-- so does it join up?
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.480]   Or is it just a little thing on your left ear?
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.800]   There is a Glasses part to it, I would imagine.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   OK.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.600]   But because this is the FCC, they don't care about that.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   They don't care about that.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.840]   That doesn't put out radio waves.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.360]   So they're not--
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   Right.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   This is the holder.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360]   OK.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   But there's a hinge, which is really nice.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.640]   So it will finally fold up like a pair of Glasses
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.360]   instead of being this big all the time.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.360]   Why are you so--
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.240]   weren't you excited about Glass at one point, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   I'm a snuck.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.080]   I'm a schmuck.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.080]   You fell for it.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.480]   I fell for it.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.000]   And I've been a worse position you.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.320]   I spent a fortune and I never got to wear it ever.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.000]   I bought it in Jason Hall as it.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.520]   That's fine.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.800]   Yeah, I got one too.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   I have my little Glass block.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.240]   It's number 1499.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.640]   Oh, what happened to my block?
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.480]   I remember.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.800]   I have my block somewhere.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.200]   Where's my block?
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.520]   But that's the Enterprise Edition, which has no software,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:30.840]   really.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.280]   So your company buys it and it's up to them
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.080]   to develop software.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.200]   Oh, god.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.360]   Even better.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.200]   Now it doesn't do anything.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.320]   There is a third generation of Google Glass
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.560]   in the works called Project Aura.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.640]   This is the one they're doing with the Luxautica.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.560]   Yeah, the logo for that came out today on 9 to 5 Google.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.040]   It's in the dashboard thing.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.920]   It's a terrible logo.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.640]   But that is supposedly going to be the next consumer version
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.160]   where the Enterprise Edition will never
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.440]   see the light of day for normal people, which is good
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.160]   because it doesn't look very interesting.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.560]   The logo looks like it's at focus.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.840]   Yeah, it's a very low resolution one apparently.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.720]   Oh, OK.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.920]   So squint, that's what it looks like.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   It's still terrible.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.200]   This looks like somebody in high school design.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.120]   Yeah, somebody designed it in high school.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.880]   So Project Aura, not to be confused with Aura,
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.480]   the modular phone.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:27.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.680]   There's an Aura.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.000]   So the new version of Google Glass will--
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.880]   what the heck do we know about this so far?
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.880]   Jeez, I forget.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   It's got to come out to consumers sometime this year.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   They had said, oh, it's under Tony Fadel with the Nest team.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   Well, Tony Fadel is the founder and CEO of Nest right now.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   I don't know if that means Google Glass is from Nest now.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   Like the Google Glass team answers to him.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.120]   And it kind of got rebooted and nobody really
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.880]   knows what they're going to do with it next.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   It's just--
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.760]   Jessica Lesson writing it, the information
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.760]   says that he's the overseer and that he did experiment
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.920]   with head-mounted designs at Apple way back when.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.320]   So this is a wearable with a screen and at least one
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.520]   without a screen.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.400]   There are three versions of the head-mounted device
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.160]   and development.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.640]   One targeted enterprise that has a screen, we saw that.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.560]   The others, which is targeted at sport users,
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   doesn't have a screen relies on audio.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.760]   So maybe it's just like the earbud.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.000]   A Motorola hint, yeah.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.960]   A hint.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.680]   Which is not a compelling device at all.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.240]   No, I have one on my desk.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.320]   Never use it.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   Because it didn't work well.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.320]   It didn't do anything different than a Bluetooth headphone.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.440]   I mean, it was supposed to, but it never really did.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.520]   Yeah, also, I mean, what do you want
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.760]   to do with a little voice in your ear given current voice?
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.080]   Well, I would mind having Google now in my ear
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.480]   if it really was--
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.400]   you know, like I could really have a relationship with it.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.720]   I mean, well, I'm not having a screen like Android Auto
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.600]   is a good--
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.560]   as weird as it sounds, it's a good idea
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.520]   of an interface without a screen because car regulations
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.320]   don't let you display text message text on a screen.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.680]   So it reads you everything.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.640]   And you know, when someone sends you a funny YouTube video
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.600]   on Android Auto, you press it and it reads the message.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.960]   And it goes, HTTP colon slash slash.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.160]   It just reads the URL out.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:29.680]   Too stupid.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.440]   It's horrible.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:30.960]   Too stupid.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.800]   But you need a screen to communicate people in.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.440]   What is it going to say for your emoji?
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.000]   It's going to say--
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   We need Jarvis.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.360]   It's going to say smiling poop emoji at the end of--
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.880]   No, no, but if it were Jarvis, it would be--
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.000]   I could interact with it.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.120]   And it would be--
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   maybe Mark Zuckerberg will write this.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.480]   And I don't mind if it has your voice, Jeff.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.120]   That's fine.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.640]   But that helped with this.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.960]   So it'll be grumpy.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:58.800]   Jarvis will be grumpy.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.680]   Grumpy.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.880]   Haven't got it yet, but apparently the new Google Maps update
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.320]   will have a driving mode and a widget, a new drive widget
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.400]   that will-- just like the now card, which
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.040]   knows where you go and gives you little hints saying, hey,
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.600]   you better leave now.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.880]   This will now be part of Google Maps.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.080]   Because I wasn't talking-- oh my god, my Google's woke up
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.680]   everywhere.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.960]   I'm talking to any of you.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.080]   And the driving mode widget, you'll tap that and it'll say, oh,
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.000]   I know where you go.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.080]   And based on that, here's how long it's going to take you.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.640]   You should leave now, that kind of thing.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.680]   Driving predictions.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:42.240]   Yeah, this would be cool for Android Auto, actually,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.000]   where you kind of have that screen.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   And it's there all the time doing something.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.760]   So you might as well make it do something useful.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.800]   Google now is very good about guessing
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.560]   where you want to drive next.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.200]   If you just open it up, it'll say, oh, do you want to go like
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.880]   here or here or here?
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.400]   And it would be able to tell pretty well after the first
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.000]   minute of you driving probably where you're headed.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.640]   So it could be interesting.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.800]   I think this doesn't work yet.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.960]   It was just--
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.600]   Well, Android police had some hack that you could do.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.840]   Let me try it.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.880]   Well, I think you can get the icon.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.920]   But it was--
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   like, they found text in the APK that says, it will do this.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.240]   But I don't think it works yet, actually.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   It'll half work.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.760]   They need to turn on a bunch of server stuff
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.120]   to make it happen, I think.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.720]   First you need Google Maps version 19.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.560]   So check that.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.440]   If you have that, then you can just log out of Google Maps,
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.120]   tap the multitasking button on your phone, swipe away,
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.360]   and just close it.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.680]   Google Maps reopen it.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.400]   Open this navigation panel.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.960]   You should see start driving.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.640]   But I don't know if it does anything.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.040]   Right, yeah.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:52.480]   Then what?
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.280]   Like, what does it do?
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.200]   I don't think it--
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.640]   I think they don't have that information
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.480]   because it doesn't work yet.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.600]   I'm going to do it anyway because I am just that kind of guy.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.480]   So I've now closed it.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.760]   Now reopen Google Maps, I guess--
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.160]   Do you have the right version, though?
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.080]   Well, I don't know.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.560]   I was too much trouble to look.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.960]   I have the right version.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.240]   Open this up, and I don't have start driving.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.320]   So I probably don't have the right version.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.720]   They're going to push--
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.560]   There's also a-- they found text in there for a to-do list,
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.080]   which sounds super awesome, where you could just be like,
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.400]   you know, go to this store, then go to this store,
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.200]   and then go get an open--
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.960]   Oh, yes.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.720]   Yeah, because a lot of your to-do lists are--
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.400]   Destinations.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.520]   Map-based, anyway.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.000]   So that would be neat.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.120]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.400]   They do that.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.520]   I have 918.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.080]   That's why.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.760]   So you need 919.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.920]   Before you do this, and even then, who knows what's
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.600]   going to happen?
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.320]   Let's see.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.640]   New weather cards are better, according to 905 Google.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.480]   In Google now, they're colorful.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.160]   And they have little pictures of bugs.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.000]   Have you seen these in?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.200]   Yeah, the old design, which we call it design.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.080]   It's now-- it's now-- this is material or more than material?
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:03.580]   Material.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.640]   Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.880]   It's more than material.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.840]   It's--
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.320]   Yeah, it's a lot more--
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:08.840]   It's a material.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.520]   It's a lot more colorful, which would be cute.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.840]   It hasn't happened on any of my stories.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.280]   Why do I have a this day in Star Wars card?
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.040]   I thought once the movie came out,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.840]   I would stop getting all of this stuff.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.120]   But I'm still on the dark side.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.040]   I get a lightsaber for Gmail.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.880]   How do you turn all that crap off?
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.800]   Is it google.com/Star Wars?
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   Maybe.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.320]   Maybe.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   I still have a TIE fighter as my colleague.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   I got it.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.160]   Yeah, Mike.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.640]   I turned that on for about two seconds.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.720]   Got super annoyed.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   And it was just like that.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.920]   I turned it on, got super annoyed,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.400]   and then forgot how to turn it off.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]   So thank you.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.360]   Please stop.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:51.480]   I'm not your father, Luke.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.360]   Oh, and I have to sit and watch an animation?
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:54.920]   OK.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.840]   You have joined the dark side.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.920]   I could change the side.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.560]   But how do I--
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.600]   Yeah, change side and put it in the middle.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.240]   Put it in the middle.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240]   Just me.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:04.760]   Yep, there you go.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.480]   Back to default.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.960]   I don't want either one of your stupid advertising
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.760]   experiments.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.080]   Your regular Google experience has now been restored.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:13.560]   Great.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.560]   Thank you.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.080]   Geez, Louise.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.520]   I hope they got millions of dollars.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.320]   So I don't seem to have these new weather cards.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.720]   But apparently this is being tested.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.480]   Yeah, I don't think anybody does.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.920]   Like one guy had it.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.520]   No, I'm not going to write it.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.560]   That's the problem with reading these blogs.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.800]   You get all these scoops, and you want it, but you don't got it.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.560]   So I'm not going to mention it.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.800]   I mean, Google now could definitely
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.080]   stand to get a bit of color.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.400]   It's always white.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.160]   White square, black text.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.960]   And maybe a picture if it's news.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.000]   But yeah, color is good.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.560]   Those look cool and colorful.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.080]   And--
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   Yeah, they're nice.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.280]   You know, I just-- I feel like Google now
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.280]   is yet another missed opportunity, frankly.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:58.760]   Yeah, they--
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.960]   Well, yeah, Google now got fought over internally
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.080]   by what the Android guys wanted it,
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.520]   and the Google search team wanted it.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.160]   And because nobody at Google ever works together on anything,
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   they fought over it.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.920]   And the people that lost like left, and it's just a big--
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.880]   it's just a big mess.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.960]   Google never works together for anything,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.480]   which is why these products get successful,
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.280]   and everybody fights over them, and then they go nowhere.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.760]   So they're very disorganized.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.280]   In fact--
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.160]   I mean, the last thing the company did together
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.360]   was Google+.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.080]   And the reason that happened is because Larry Page bribed
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.320]   everybody and was like, if this doesn't succeed,
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.880]   we're taking your bonus away.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.440]   And that's what it takes.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.600]   That's what it takes to get Google to work as a singular
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:53.480]   company to threaten everyone by taking away their paycheck.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.920]   Well, somebody at Google likes yoga,
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.960]   because now when you search for yoga poses,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:03.680]   you actually get a knowledge card that has the yoga pose in it.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.320]   Here's downward facing dog.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.000]   Adho Mukhasavasana.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.600]   Savanasana.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.680]   Let's see.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.840]   Warrior one.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.160]   Let's see you do it, Leo.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.560]   Oh, I could do downward facing dog.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   Wow.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   There you go.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   Wow.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Baba Nasha.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Baba Nasha.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   Dasha.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.840]   He says, consult a doctor before beginning an exercise.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   He knows you.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.960]   It's advice just to customize for you, Leo.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.600]   Sun salutation.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.120]   No.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.120]   Oh, no.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.520]   You know, somebody likes yoga at Google.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.880]   Probably that'll be one of the breakout sessions
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.080]   at Google I/O.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:49.920]   Let's see.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.000]   Anything else here?
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.280]   I'm going through it.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.600]   You can now get an X's 5X for real cheap.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.640]   Oh, there's the Google campus in my roundup,
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.240]   which is very sad.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.520]   They were going to do that weird spider web-y.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.760]   Oh, they're not doing that?
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.240]   They gave up?
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.720]   This is all local politics for you, isn't it?
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.200]   They went to the city, and they asked for the space
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.600]   that they needed, and they awarded most of it to LinkedIn.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.240]   So instead of building however many--
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.480]   because Mountain View was going to be totally owned by Google,
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.320]   and that really scared the city.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.840]   So they gave all the land Google wanted to LinkedIn.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.600]   And now they have this crazy visionary campus
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.560]   with reconfigurable buildings, and it's like half indoor, half
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.080]   outdoor.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.400]   And nowhere to put it.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.200]   And yeah, I know where to put it now.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.520]   Yeah, it's like this weird glass mesh roof.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.680]   So come to the jersey, Google.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.520]   Cut these.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.320]   There were people doing yoga.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.520]   There's some people skating skateboards.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.080]   This could have made-- remade Mountain View into a cloud.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:58.640]   King doesn't--
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.720]   They'd tear down the old bell labs and put it up there.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.720]   There you go.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.360]   The problem with that is they already don't have office space.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.520]   So bringing office space offline for two, three years
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.840]   is just not going to fly over there.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.160]   It does-- every time I've been, it
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.520]   seems to be in a perpetual state of construction anyway.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.880]   So they just need more space.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.440]   Is this like the bio dome?
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.120]   Is it sealed?
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.000]   And it's ecologically recycling?
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.840]   Or is it-- are those panels open to the air?
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.280]   It's not sealed.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.040]   It's like a hybrid indoor outdoor space a lot of times
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.320]   where the roof is there to keep the rain off of you
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.160]   and not too much else.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.280]   They can deploy little umbrellas to walk the California
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:51.280]   somebody.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.080]   Oh, I see the little umbrellas.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.280]   That's really silly.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.560]   And they're on the balcony.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.600]   There's people doing yoga.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.480]   Yeah, right there.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.000]   This could be the New San Diego Chargers stadium.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.320]   Somebody--
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.520]   It's a word.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.560]   There were supposed to be robot cranes that could reconfigure
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.480]   the rooms to different--
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.800]   Oh, they do that in Japan.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.480]   They have those modular apartment buildings
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.840]   and it comes and it moves you into a different place.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.480]   Yeah, the whole thing was going to be modular
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.960]   because they're like, oh, this search team
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   has different office needs from the self-driving car team.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.640]   And yeah, they were going to be able to swap all that around
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.640]   and there were going to be retail establishments
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.760]   where regular people could walk around
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.440]   and buy stuff.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   Wow.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.040]   None of that's going to happen anymore.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.160]   Is Project Loon still around?
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.240]   The balloons?
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.960]   Yeah, Loon is part of Google X, which is just X now,
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.240]   given the name.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.800]   I love it that when you're talking about Calico,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:57.560]   your byline is death still isn't cured.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.480]   So nice try, Google.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.080]   That's a tough-- that's a tough mission.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.080]   It's going to be a hard one.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.680]   What happens?
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.160]   Google's anti-aging research company.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.200]   Yeah, a rough mission statement to just say,
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.760]   we're going to stop people from dying and they have not yet.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.000]   So keep working.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.520]   Good luck.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.400]   It's all partnerships with Calico.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   Like they partner with--
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.480]   I think it was--
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.600]   a bunch of different research universities and companies
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.320]   and everything else.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.200]   And that's it.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.080]   There's really nothing else to talk about there.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.840]   A lot of the extra alphabet stuff is just so--
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.000]   such deep R&D, you're not going to see it for like five,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.080]   10 more years.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:39.760]   Right.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.440]   Project wing drone deliveries.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   Here's Macani, which are flying wind turbines.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.080]   This looks like a crash.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.120]   But in fact, that's not.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.640]   That is the prototype being lifted by a crane.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.840]   Yeah, that is a big plane wind turbine thing.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.440]   So there's a link to a video in there.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:07.400]   And when you hear this thing, it makes these crazy rev noises.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.000]   And it's like, nobody's going to want that.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.560]   Flying over them.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.560]   Yeah, to replace a windmill.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.920]   And when the weather gets bad, you have to pull it down and park it.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.280]   So that doesn't get struck by lightning and crash.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.520]   I mean, look how big that thing is.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.040]   If it decides to not be aerodynamic anymore
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.720]   and slam into the ground.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.440]   Wait a minute, though.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.360]   I don't understand.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.840]   It's flying, but it's getting wind power.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.040]   Is it-- is there a wire attached to it?
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.760]   So the idea is you take a wind turbine
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.000]   and you stick it really, really high up in the sky
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.840]   where there's more-- the air is faster.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.680]   It's useful in more places because wind turbines
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.400]   have to have a certain amount of wind.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.600]   So wind turbines tend to be in big, empty fields
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.000]   where if you just go up higher, the wind's stronger
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.720]   and you can generate power.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.040]   It's all blue sky research.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.560]   I'm glad they're doing it.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.960]   But yeah, but they sound horrible.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.920]   Yeah, back.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:16.520]   There is something dystopian about 1,000 of those above you.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.280]   Yeah, that's just one.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.240]   And the other thing is density.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.440]   So as tall as the wire is, that's also how far apart they
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440]   have these.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.680]   So they want collide.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.360]   So this one, as neat as a lot of the Google R&D projects are,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.600]   this one has a lot of issues that are just
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.080]   all kinds of wacky--
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.720]   So does it gain wind power when it descends?
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.680]   Or how is that--
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.520]   It's a kite.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:45.960]   I get it.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.360]   It's like a kite.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.160]   It is a kite with wind turbines attached.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.480]   So it doesn't need--
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.560]   --to go anywhere.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.000]   The propellers don't propel it.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.360]   The propellers are the wind turbine.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:57.880]   Got it.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.360]   Right.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.280]   And it's just catching the wind, man.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.040]   I see.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.400]   That is pretty wonderfully good.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.840]   It's brilliantly stupid.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.760]   It's just great.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.160]   You need people to do stuff like that.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.480]   Did you see the Da Vinci series that's on TV?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.840]   I didn't discover it until this week.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.680]   There's a Da Vinci's ghost, I think it's called.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.680]   It's actually pretty fun.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.920]   But it feels like Da Vinci has Google.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.320]   Da Vinci's ghost.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   Da Vinci's ghost.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.200]   Is that the name of it?
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:33.840]   Is that the name of it?
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.120]   Toby Lester, yeah.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.720]   Tells the story of the world's most iconic image
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.760]   of a true-vian man.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.240]   No, wait, that's a book.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.040]   That's a book.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:47.920]   What do you want?
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.760]   Somebody made it.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.600]   It's a TV show.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.520]   There's a show out of it.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.960]   Oh, yeah, it's NPR.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.880]   No, it's NPR.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.800]   No, no, it's a TV show.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.440]   Never mind, I can't find it.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440]   Hold on.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.520]   OK, genius obsession.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.800]   I don't know.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.520]   Anyway.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.520]   Oh, and I started this, and I can't help you.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520]   OK.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.040]   It's OK.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:09.600]   It doesn't matter.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.280]   Maybe there in a second.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.320]   Just be one second.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.160]   It's Da Vinci's demons?
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.440]   Da Vinci's demons now.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.160]   Let's not.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.520]   It is Da Vinci's demons, isn't it?
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520]   It is Da Vinci's demons, yes.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.000]   Oh, OK.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.040]   Da Vinci's demons.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:20.800]   Not as ghost.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   It's stars.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   It's a star show.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.080]   And I just watched the first episode because it was free on Google Play.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.400]   I'll have to check it out.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.200]   It's science and sex and the same thing.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.400]   You know, it's perfect for our audience.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.320]   Is it the untold story of Leonardo da Vinci?
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   Oh, so it's like a dramatization of his life.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320]   Yes.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320]   Oh, that sounds good.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320]   Yeah, it is.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320]   It's fun.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320]   Yeah, I'll watch that.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320]   So far.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.800]   Apparently, Facebook mentions can now be run on Android.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.680]   So those of us who are verified Facebook personalities can now.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.280]   Sorry.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.640]   No, I can do fae.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   I can do mentions now.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   No, I know.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.640]   I'm just saying to the rest of the audience.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   Oh, for the rest of you.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   So I thought you were a neener in your name.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.440]   I was being an asshole.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.080]   Well, Ricky Gervais kind of stopped doing it now.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:15.640]   So Facebook mentions, I'm just going to see if I can download this.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.400]   Yeah, but you have other people doing it now.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.600]   So, so, Jake Eager from young Turks, he just turns it all the other day and his hotel room
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.280]   screaming about how one soap bar is enough.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.600]   I need one soap bar for the tub, but I need one soap.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600]   Oh, please.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600]   That's the last thing I want to see.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.280]   Oh, I actually kind of enjoyed it.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280]   Really?
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.040]   I thought I downloaded it.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040]   Come on.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   It's not under M for mentions.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.320]   No, it's you have to look for Facebook mentions, but it's not under F for Facebook either.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.640]   Well, I just found it.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.920]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.080]   So I downloaded it already.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.080]   I can't live stream.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080]   Oh, you can't find it on your phone.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.680]   Oh, Google's self-driving cars would have caused 10 accidents.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.600]   If, if the drivers hadn't grabbed the wheel.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.000]   So I'm kind of glad they still have a wheel.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.440]   Google always said, Oh, those 17 reported accidents, those were always caused by humans.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.560]   But those were those were caused by humans, but there were 10 near misses that were stopped
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560]   by humans.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.640]   Test drivers disengaged the self-driving system on 69 occasions between September 2014 and
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.400]   November 2015.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.240]   Yeah, a lot of that is them.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.440]   A lot of that is them being overly cautious.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:33.840]   Yeah, according to Google's simulations, the self-driving car would have made contact
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:42.040]   with an object on 13 occasions out of the 69 events on 10 of the 13 simulated contacts.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.360]   In other words, driving somebody over or something.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.160]   The system would have been at fault.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:53.080]   And two of the 10 would have been with traffic cones.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.920]   Okay.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.040]   They had to hand over their data of when or whenever an override came.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040]   Right.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   Which is fascinating.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040]   That's that's one way to test.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.040]   When did you have to override?
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.040]   Right.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:11.000]   Yeah, the, the, I thought the biggest news out of C.E.S. was that they were, what was
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   it?
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   I said that Google and Ford were going to announce a self-driving.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   Right.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   Didn't happen.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   It was the big news.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   Yeah, and then it didn't happen.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.960]   But, but just that they, like we don't know if it just totally doesn't exist or if they
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.560]   just decided not to announce it.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:33.920]   Like it's hard to believe that, that they got the report totally, totally wrong.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.920]   But just the, the idea that they were going to make a joint venture with Ford that kept
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:44.440]   Ford like legally safe from all of the, the self-driving cars legal issues.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440]   Ah, interesting.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.440]   But it was really cool.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:50.880]   Like that sounded like an actual solution that they could get some car coming to adopt.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:58.400]   Because Google needs somebody to build these cars and to, to kind of have a path to consumerization
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.960]   is, is really neat.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.480]   But I don't know, I don't know what Ford's deal was.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.760]   I don't know why it just never happened or I don't know man.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:12.400]   So, it was, it was really exciting to, to have the car stuff take a step forward.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.840]   Because all of this, as much as the, the weird, you know, we talk about silly gadgets and,
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.920]   and all this other stuff, but the self-driving car stuff can like actually save lives.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.920]   I think it's going to happen.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.920]   I really think it's going to happen.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.920]   Really important.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.480]   Here's something that I hope doesn't happen in the state of Kentucky.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.820]   A lawmaker has proposed a bill that would ban you from posting a video of a horrible accident
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:36.040]   for an hour after it happens.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.880]   That's, that's the stupidest thing on earth.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.640]   The rolling information doesn't work fell off.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.400]   It comes from a state representative, Jam, John, Bam, Carney.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.960]   State representatives are just, you know, the, the panic.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.240]   That's why I'm starting to get in trouble now because of your, that's why, yeah, we,
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.320]   we want states rights.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.880]   So people like that can run the world.
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:05.880]   Bam, Carney would impose a fine of $20 to $100 if you publish a video of any of the, of,
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:13.440]   any accident or, or any information identifying the victims of serious physical injury unless
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:19.720]   you're the victim in which case it's okay.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:24.400]   He says, it's purely my intent to get a discussion going out there asking people to be more respectful
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.320]   about what they put on social media.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.680]   What happens in Kentucky stays in Kentucky.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:35.720]   I don't think legislating Twitter is ever going to.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.720]   Good luck.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.840]   You got to pay somebody to look at all of that and Google where they live and send them a
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840]   ticket.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   Good luck with that.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   You can't.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   That's prior restraint.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.000]   There's a whole bunch of problems with that.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   Good article.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.600]   I thought from Stephen Levy once again writing for medium his interview with Bill Ford at
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:32:01.520]   CES in which she, Bill Ford effectively says, Hey, we're, we're pivoting the Ford motor
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.680]   company, which by the way was the most successful car company of 2015 and a year.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:11.760]   Which all the car companies did very, very well admitting that it's not so much about
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.480]   cars anymore.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:23.600]   Ford is, he says, Stephen asks, uh, Bill, can I call you Bill, is Ford attempting the
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:31.360]   biggest pivot at all time and, uh, Bill Ford says, no question.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.860]   No question.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:37.900]   So Ford did announce, they, while they didn't announce the Google, uh, partnership that it
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:43.780]   announced, for instance, a program to play sensors in motorcycles to map roads in West
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:48.340]   Africa to improve the routing of healthcare services.
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:55.740]   Um, they may in fact get in the Uber and Lyft business.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.780]   They have a lot of interesting things.
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:02.340]   You know, they're kind of recognizing the, yeah, when you mentioned Ford.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.100]   So I, I, I run them on this, on this constant question.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.100]   See if I can't get the car.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.900]   I want to help you do it.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.540]   Ron can help you.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:14.060]   So I went and looked at the Lincoln M K C. Ooh, nice.
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.900]   Nice car.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:16.900]   And I don't know.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.620]   Are you ready for a Lincoln?
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.900]   I haven't bought a one of my old enough.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:24.260]   I haven't bought a bus car.
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.900]   You are since, uh, yeah, thanks a lot.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:27.900]   Since 1973.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.900]   It was the last time I bought a US car.
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.000]   I was looking at the new Lincoln Continental.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.500]   Can you give the continental?
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.180]   I think it has the 2016 Lincoln Continental.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.700]   It's really, it writes a Ron.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:42.660]   I think three with the Ford sync three and sync three works with the three.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.660]   You'll do.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:49.260]   In fact, we got an email from one of our listeners who has, I think an escape and he will, he
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.500]   got an email from Ford.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.340]   He's going to get an upgrade in March.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.180]   Well, to support Android Auto.
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:00.100]   So I've been, I'm actually working on an article that, that kind of compares, uh, infotainment
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:02.780]   systems from, from all the different, uh, car vendors.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.260]   I've had, I've had a stream of vehicles.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.380]   Oh, fun for you to make this happen.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:19.100]   Um, and the level of just complete misunderstanding or incompetence from these car companies when
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.100]   it comes to software.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.100]   It's so bad.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.140]   I shouldn't be writing their own software.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:34.700]   I just had a Chevy Impala and the software on it looked like a Chinese GPS from eBay from
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.700]   like 1999.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:42.420]   I'm talking like, like the phone icon is like a fully rendered 3D phone with like a chrome
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:48.740]   ring around the square and it looks like it just all looks, it's, it's, it looks so bad
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:54.540]   and it works horribly and nothing, nothing like scrolls smooth.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:58.140]   So there's an argument though for Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay, right?
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.780]   Oh, the, these, these car companies, like you're not a software company.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.780]   Don't do it.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:07.420]   So Ron, it's worth it to try to get Android Auto.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.420]   Huh?
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.420]   Hell yes.
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:11.420]   Anything.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.460]   I think in almost every case, if you get Android, oh, you'll get CarPlay.
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:23.060]   It's just, no, no, it is, it is separate.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.460]   Car companies will support one and not the other.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:26.620]   It's all over the place.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.180]   Some cars do both, right?
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:32.660]   Because I'm not going to buy a car that will not do both because I use different phones.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:38.980]   And some car companies have one and have promised to ship a software upgrade to update.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:41.820]   Four percent it would do both, I believe.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.020]   Okay.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:48.460]   So my, the favorite one I've run into so far is Honda, which bases their car infotainment
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:53.140]   system on Android 4.0 from 2011.
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:58.380]   And it has the stock Android browser in it, which you can just use.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:03.740]   So you know, Chrome gets a security update every, every couple months or every month.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.420]   And imagine using a browser on the internet from 2011 and the security issues that this
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.140]   thing has that they just sell.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:15.740]   Like it's 2016 and they sell software from 2011 in these cars.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:20.540]   The car companies, they are not equipped to be hardware companies in, in any fashion.
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:21.620]   And Ford's just as bad.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.220]   I, I had a Ford Escape.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:30.100]   The whole system looks like it's, it's a settings page from like, like it's just white
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.860]   with blue icons and nothing else.
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.620]   And it's, it's slow and weird.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.220]   So what do you recommend?
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.740]   Get something with Android Auto?
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:41.100]   I mean, it's, it's all, it's all.
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:42.780]   They're all bad.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:48.220]   And even if you try to like really use the stuff, the mapping situation, there are no
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.260]   good Mac vendors out there.
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.260]   I mean, there are the two.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.660]   I can't find it right now.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:58.740]   There are a VW executive, a company we really want to trust right now, went on saying that,
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:02.260]   oh, we, you know, these, these, these, these little comfy companies don't know how to do
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.260]   this.
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.180]   They can't do mapping and all this as well as we can.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.620]   And that's why we're not going to use Android Auto and stuff.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:10.300]   You know, we're going to not push it in the car.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.220]   No, your system suck.
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.460]   Listen to wrong people.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:20.420]   And the worst is the voice commands where like on a, on a phone, you can say navigate to,
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:25.020]   you know, us, you can say navigate to Best Buy on your store, on your, your phone.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:29.700]   And then on these car systems, you say navigate to Best Buy and nothing happens.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.380]   And then it will say navigate.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.980]   And then you have to tell it the city and then you have to, or you have to tell it, you
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:40.460]   have to tell it, you want a point of interest first, then you tell it the city.
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.460]   Right.
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:42.460]   Then you tell it.
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:43.940]   But that's, there's a reason for that, Ron.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.940]   They're not online.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.620]   They're doing that all with their internal computer.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:52.500]   Whereas your, your phone is smart enough to be sending your voice up to the server.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.460]   And it can then, you know, do a lot better job.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:58.820]   Some of them tethered to your phone and, and work online.
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:04.700]   The worst, the worst is Chevy, which has a 4G modem in the car.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.860]   So the car is a big hotspot with AT&T.
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:12.100]   So your car has a monthly bill to get data access.
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:17.220]   And this is the kind of misunderstanding that car companies have, where they say, we need
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.860]   to get internet in the car.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.340]   So let's, let's call AT&T.
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:21.900]   And it's like, nobody wants that.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:22.900]   Just tell her to my phone.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:23.900]   Right.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.900]   I already have internet.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.940]   You don't need to get my Audi S3G on T-Mobile and they're going to have LTE next year.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.420]   And you're right.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.260]   It should all be through the phone, frankly.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:33.260]   Right.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.820]   I'm going to keep asking Ron, what, what's the best path to put in?
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:42.020]   Which, which manufacturer has the best structure to use Android Auto?
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:47.020]   Um, there, I mean, they're all about, if you can find something that supports Android
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:51.340]   Auto, they're all about the same because the car system turns off and, and Android Auto
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:54.180]   just kind of takes over.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:57.980]   But I've seen, I know Honda will do it and that's, that's pretty good.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.460]   Honda's a good choice.
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:00.460]   That's a nice car.
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.260]   Yeah, you can get a relatively nice Honda.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.740]   With, with all of this, they have some cool like automated driving stuff where it'll do
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:11.940]   radar guided cruise control and kind of stay within the painted lines as you, you drive
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.740]   along.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:20.020]   That's probably been the best one I've seen so far as, as terrifyingly insecure as the
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.620]   operating system is.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:25.540]   It seems to be the least awful.
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.220]   But they're all, it's just all bad right now.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.580]   And I don't know.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:33.100]   Well, that's, but I, that's why I feel like car playing Android Auto are really the way
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.100]   to go.
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.660]   And even then you have to, you have to be careful about the hardware because the Chevy
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.900]   that I looked at had a resistive touchscreen.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:42.660]   Oh, yik.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.260]   I'm talking about you could go to the settings and go to a line touchscreen and they put
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:53.900]   the little X's on the screen and you have to poke in each corner and in the center.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:58.300]   Because all of the gear they use is from like 2011 because car companies, they don't
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.460]   understand technology.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.820]   They move it a snail space.
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:01.820]   It's horrible.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:05.740]   But look at the, so this is from Androids, Android Auto website.
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.380]   I mean, these are the, oh, but it's BS.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.740]   These are the badges that they say we'll be using Android Auto and it's pretty much everybody.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:17.280]   And then where's two as you go into, I, an Audi, when I was thinking about an Audi,
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.540]   now these are very nice.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.020]   Into three dealers.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:23.380]   And I say Android Auto and they'll say Android audio.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.380]   Oh, Lord.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.620]   When you're getting it, they don't know anything.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:30.580]   I went online to Twitter and said, what's the deal and they gave me a bad answer?
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.820]   I tried to go to the PR department of the company and never got an answer.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.900]   It's like they don't really know.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.740]   These dealers are all idiots about it.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:42.500]   Oh, and I think that attitude extends all the way up to the top of the company and the
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:44.100]   people making this software.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.060]   It's just nobody there understands technology from top to bottom.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.780]   When about the Tesla media experience?
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.220]   You think that'd be pretty good.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.380]   I try to Tesla too.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.620]   Is it better?
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:59.260]   No, Tesla is at least interesting.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:02.500]   Tesla is at least interesting because it's a big giant television.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.260]   Yes, 17 inch screen.
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:05.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.660]   But, but no, it's still, it's still this software.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:12.100]   I say it feels like ATM software.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.940]   Yeah, that's about right.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:20.460]   Where like it is a computer, but it was never designed to make anybody happy or look nice
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:24.580]   or just work well.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.140]   It's just not good.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:32.020]   It's still not from a software company that makes, and when you look at any computer,
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:35.180]   there is a monopoly on computer interfaces.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:39.300]   Well, not a monopoly, but there's three companies you can buy a computer interface from.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:42.260]   It's Apple, Google, Microsoft, and that's it.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:47.140]   Nobody else really makes software like operating systems.
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.740]   If you want a laptop or phone or a tablet or it's only those three companies.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.620]   I don't want the other two car.
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:53.620]   Good software.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:54.620]   Right.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:59.380]   Yeah, a lot of these, a lot of these cars do run Linux and they're running Q and X.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.380]   Many.
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.300]   Yeah, they run Q and X Linux, Android.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.060]   A lot of cars actually run Android.
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:06.340]   I don't want Android 4.0 in my car.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:07.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.340]   I do not.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:14.580]   Well, one of the things in my article is Google is going to make a real version of Android
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:20.980]   4 cars where it's the operating system that runs in the car hardware as opposed to Android
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:25.180]   Auto, which is just an application that takes over the screen.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.620]   This is actually.
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.620]   This is actually.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:29.980]   What if, okay, I got a solution for it.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:39.500]   What if you got a car that didn't have anything and you put in a aftermarket Android Auto solution?
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.500]   Have you tried those?
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.500]   Oh, like a...
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500]   Like pioneers head-to-head unit.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.660]   Really expensive and they clued up the car.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:51.540]   Yeah, and they're resistive touch screens again most of the time.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.700]   But you're talking about a thousand bucks for that radio.
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:43:03.340]   If your car can even support that, I mean half the time step one is get a hacksaw and
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:08.020]   cut your radio out of the car.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.620]   But that's why I want to see this Google car operating system.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:22.180]   And in there the Google Play documents car is an operating system form factor next to
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.140]   TV watch, phone and tablet.
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:32.300]   So there are actually rules for device manufacturers on how to build a car with Android built into
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.300]   it.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.300]   Okay, here you go.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.580]   This is what you do.
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:38.380]   This is the Pioneer Avic 8100NEX.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.580]   It is a capacitive touch screen.
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.020]   It does Android Auto and CarPlay.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.940]   It's only $1,200.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:47.060]   I know, amazing.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.060]   But you might be able to...
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:49.060]   It's seven inches.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:55.940]   You might be able to get a deal on a car without any kind of head-to-head unit.
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:01.620]   And see this is another company that does not understand technology because what kind
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:02.620]   of processors in that?
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:03.620]   Probably not enough.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:07.860]   No, you won't even find that on the Amazon page.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:12.500]   They don't think it's important because they don't know what any of those numbers mean.
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:13.500]   Right.
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.500]   What does that mean?
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.020]   It's four volts, 800 by 480 display.
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:19.020]   Right.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.020]   No processor.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.020]   Is it a Snapdragon?
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   Right.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:27.380]   But isn't it the case with Android Auto that the processor is really the phone more than
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:28.380]   the unit?
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:33.660]   But you're still buying a car head unit that runs some kind of...
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.220]   It has Pioneer software.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.220]   Yes.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.220]   Some kind of...
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:39.220]   Look at this.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.220]   This is awesome.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.940]   It has a remote control you could put right on the dash.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.940]   I remember that.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.940]   That'll really...
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:47.340]   That thing still feels like it's from the '90s.
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:48.460]   What the hell?
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.380]   This is not what you want in your car.
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.740]   So you don't have to lean forward.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.220]   Just tape that to the steering wheel.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:00.780]   That's it.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.780]   That's the other bummer with that.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:03.580]   That's not going to integrate with your car.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.620]   Android Auto and CarPlay and all that stuff, the steering wheel buttons will work.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]   All right.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620]   There's usually a microphone.
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.620]   So what should Jeff do?
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:11.620]   He should just give up and get a car next year.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.780]   So it sounds like it's a Ford.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:14.780]   Get a...
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:15.780]   Yeah, get a Ford or a Honda.
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:16.780]   Get something with car...
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:17.780]   It's all that's stuck.
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:18.780]   It's all that's stuck.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:19.780]   It's all that's stuck.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:24.020]   If you follow the smartphone trajectory, I feel like we're in the Windows mobile phase
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.020]   right now.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:26.020]   That's where...
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.740]   Where just every piece of software you buy is going to suck.
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:30.740]   So far.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.700]   You're a car for 11 years.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.500]   And so I don't know if I'm going to keep this one for 11 years.
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.300]   By the way, you're the old...
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.380]   That is the average in the United States.
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:42.620]   The average age of a car on the road in the United States is 11 years.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.580]   You're driving in a thousand miles.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:49.340]   But that's the problem is there's the long design cycle of three to five years of a car.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:51.340]   And then people keep it for 10 years.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.340]   Yes.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.340]   No technical...
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:59.060]   You don't use any personal computer or consumer electronic technology that's 15 years old.
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.220]   And they would make such play for me.
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:06.460]   It would swap out the consumer electronic experience in the car every year.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.220]   Just like I do phones, right?
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.380]   I did make a fortune from an aftermarket.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:12.620]   I'm going to get this Chevy Bolt.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620]   That'll have...
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.620]   That looks kind of nice.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.100]   That looks pretty cool.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:20.180]   Hey, if you know who...
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:26.060]   If you know who Cinnamon Toast can, Cute Pie Marsia, you know who they are, don't you, Chris?
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:33.660]   Dodger Emma Blackery, Jack Septic Eye, Jelly, Quibble Cop, and Mark Plier.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:38.300]   Markiplier R, you're going to be very excited about this announcement.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:47.580]   Cute Pie is starting his own video network featuring those and other great YouTube stars.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.580]   That's Cute Pie.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.580]   You know, it won't be long before we'll be running for president.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.580]   Cute Pie.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:56.900]   31 million passionate subscribers, according to the Verge on YouTube.
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:03.740]   And Revel Mode is going to be backed by Maker Studios, which is in turn backed by Disney.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:08.020]   Cute Pie, of course, the number one star on YouTube right now, reputedly makes $7 million
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:11.060]   a year off of his 41 million subscribers.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:17.900]   And now he's going to make even more with the Cute Pie network.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:21.140]   Well, he has lasted longer than Peach.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:23.220]   Yeah, Peach is over.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.020]   Cute Pie lives.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:30.300]   When you put Cinnamon Toast Ken together with Jack Septic Eye and the rest, you get 100
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:31.300]   million subscribers.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.300]   That's fine.
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.900]   That makes me feel older or more out of touch than any of that.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.900]   I know.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:37.900]   I know.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.900]   I love that.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.900]   Cute Pie stuff.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:40.900]   I just have no idea.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.900]   I know.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:48.500]   Craig Newmark posted on Facebook asking for permission to buy a pirate ship.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:56.700]   He says, honey, honey, there's a story of a pirate ship for sale on Craigslist.
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:00.820]   And there is Craig Newmark just saying, honey, question mark, honey, can I better.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:05.780]   Can I buy it for a small fee relative to the local Bay Area home prices?
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:10.580]   You can buy a ship equipped with a player piano and a saloon, a three inch thick, huge
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:15.580]   dining table made of rich mahogany, three bedrooms, a galley and a full bar, obviously.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.260]   Oh, so you could listen to it because they're very real estate.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.020]   That's not a bad deal.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:24.100]   Ah, yeah.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:25.100]   How much is it?
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:26.100]   Did I wait a minute?
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.100]   No.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:30.140]   Then I have a switch to a man shot to death on a truck.
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:31.620]   I don't know.
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.660]   USA Today is just the worst.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.180]   Completely lost.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.980]   Oh, this story.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.980]   Okay.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.460]   For better.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.460]   How much is it?
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:47.060]   It's an authentic replica of a brigantine that sailed in the 1700s.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.420]   Doesn't say how much he wants for it.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:50.420]   Make an offer.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.580]   Oh, $50,000 is nothing.
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:53.580]   That's nothing.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.500]   The problem is I think you have to talk pirate all the time.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:59.100]   Ah, wait a minute.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:00.100]   Lisa.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.140]   Wait a minute.
[01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:04.220]   We've been looking for a new studio space.
[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.220]   This is it.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.980]   I always wanted a pirate radio.
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:10.980]   This is it.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.980]   It is.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:12.980]   $50,000.
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:15.780]   We can own it outright and sail it off.
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:18.660]   Interesting live off the coast of San Francisco.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:19.660]   Pirate twin.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.660]   Awesome.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:26.740]   He actually was hosting kids' birthday parties and private parties on it.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:32.780]   But I guess he's been in the Brisbane Marina for 20 years.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:38.900]   It needs work, says Channel 5 News, but the bones are good.
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:41.540]   Oh, man.
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:49.140]   It would be such a perfect podcast paradise as we sailed the seven seas in search of Google
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.140]   news.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:51.140]   Jason, pirate radio.
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:54.340]   What kind of internet would you get on that thing?
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.140]   17th century internet.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:59.740]   You have a great internet on his cruise ship.
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.180]   Actually, that's really true.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.860]   The internet was phenomenal on Royal Caribbean.
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:09.500]   And thank you, Chris Hughes, for buying the new republic, trashing the new republic, and
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:16.780]   then saying I'm tired of the new republic and selling it.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:18.300]   What are you going to do?
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.300]   How old is Chris Hughes?
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:20.300]   He looks like he's 14.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.300]   32, I think.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:22.300]   He's so young.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.820]   He was, of course, one of the Facebook billionaires.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.980]   And in 2012, he bought what was one of the great progressive magazines.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.260]   It was head of God about hell itself.
[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:33.260]   Had it.
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.300]   It's known for a long time by a real estate developer.
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.860]   Well, I thought it was quite good.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:42.500]   But anyway, he says, after investing a great deal of time, energy, over $20 million.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.060]   I've come to the conclusion.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.020]   It's time for new leadership and vision at the new republic.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:53.780]   Of course, he decided to make changes in the entire staff left.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:58.900]   When he said we're going to make a date, when he say it digitally facing, we covered
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.340]   it when he had digitally facing.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:05.700]   That was crazy.
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.100]   Street View.
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.580]   Here's a fun one.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:11.980]   Best things come in small street view packages.
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:16.660]   They're doing a street view of Das Miniatur of Wunderland, Al-Gul maps.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:20.260]   It's the world's largest model railway.
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:26.860]   And Google made a little promo video for how they're going to do it on Google Maps.
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:29.660]   It's kind of cute.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.460]   They're zooming into this.
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.740]   Obviously, it's in Germany.
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:34.740]   Have you seen it?
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:35.740]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:36.740]   I've got it.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.140]   I've better things to do when I'm in Germany.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:41.220]   It's Hamburg.
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.260]   Hamburg.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260]   Hamburg.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:52.500]   So they made a little adventurous review car.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:59.500]   That's kind of cool.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:05.140]   He's riding through the quaint streets of the miniature railroad.
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:07.860]   Did they really get a camera that tiny?
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.580]   I guess they did.
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:11.180]   How can I search for this?
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:14.020]   Let me go to maps.google.com.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:17.940]   And is it Miniatur of Wunderland?
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:21.540]   Oh, there's a link, of course, there is.
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:25.580]   There it is.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.100]   That's really cute.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:33.620]   It weighs to brilliance, but what's, you know, why not?
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:34.620]   It's an ad.
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:35.620]   It got us talking about it.
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.620]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.140]   And sure, the next time I'm in Hamburg, I'll go there.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:42.580]   Oh, you will in your in your later housing.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.500]   And my I have the later hose and I'm ready.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.300]   Wrong, wrong, half a journey, but that's fine.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:47.300]   I am ready.
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:48.300]   All right, ladies.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.540]   Germany, the one that super hates street view and band.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:52.740]   They should be all right.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:53.740]   That's the only right.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.940]   They're going to be blurring the little toy building.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.940]   So I draw things.
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:58.620]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:02.220]   We come back to your number, your pick, anything you want to talk about.
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:04.500]   I brought treats.
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.820]   It's nature box time.
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:10.740]   Nature box is a triple is the triple A of snacks.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:14.420]   When hunger strikes, don't reach for that half eaten bag of chips between the couch
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:18.540]   cushions that tastes like something between salt and sadness.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:22.540]   Be prepared with smart and delicious snacks from nature box.
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:27.460]   Back in white granola, cocoa and vanilla flavored granola, salt and pepper pistachios.
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:28.460]   I could eat those.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.460]   Those are good.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:30.460]   Garden tomato crunchies.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:37.900]   The thing about this is a nature box are snacks are healthy always made with under nutritionist
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:44.380]   guidance, never any high fructose corn syrup saturated fats, artificial colors or flavors.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:47.820]   And they can tailor your snack to your taste.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.020]   Sweet, savory, spicy.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:52.380]   Or to your dietary needs.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:56.340]   In my case, they've got those delicious pineapples.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:00.820]   All the stuff I can eat, the pistachios, great choices.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.460]   And they come to your door once a month in a box.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.420]   Fuel your game engine with healthy snacks.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:13.060]   Was it naturebox.com/twit to get 50% off your first box right now.
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:19.220]   Slay your hunger dragon with the sword of nutrition.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.740]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:22.380]   Off off your first box right now.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.900]   That is a good deal.
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:24.900]   Delicious.
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:29.940]   Now my stomach is growling.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:32.260]   Jeff Jarvis, you want to do a number of the week?
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:36.580]   I kind of, I already did my pick because I showed that remix OS.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:37.660]   It's free to download.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.020]   You can put it on USB key and boot into the x86 version of it.
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.020]   I have another one too.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.020]   I'll do in a bit.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:48.100]   But Jeff, you want to do number then we'll give Ron a chance to pick some.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.660]   Oh, I'll do two of them.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.660]   All right.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:54.460]   But actually first you're going to have to turn off the sound for a moment.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.940]   Okay.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.940]   Shh.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:58.940]   Turn it back on.
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.460]   Oh, he's blowing as he's sneezing.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.060]   Yeah, that's sorry.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:06.740]   He got, he got, you probably had one of those black pepper naturebox snacks.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:07.740]   That's right.
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.740]   That's right.
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:09.740]   I'm allergic to the hat.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.740]   Chew.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:11.740]   It does.
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:17.340]   I just want to mention one thing, which is Udacity is now offering a job guarantee for
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:21.660]   four of their of their nano degree courses, nano degree plus.
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:25.020]   And within six months, if you don't have a job in the area you've learned trained to
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.940]   do, you'll get your all your tuition back.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.740]   Oh, that is awesome.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:32.020]   Isn't that Sebastian is so cool.
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:36.940]   The founder of Udacity, son Jake is busy working for Hillary Clinton right now.
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:41.460]   But otherwise he's really Jake's working for the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire.
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:42.460]   You bet.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.460]   Good for Jake.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:48.900]   But otherwise he's taking the nano degree and looks like a good program.
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:50.940]   Well, he was a programmer in high school.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:52.940]   Yeah, he's been doing it this way.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:56.300]   He got to, you know, to a certified level of that area.
[01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:57.300]   What is he learning?
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.700]   He's doing the iOS, I think.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:02.100]   But he's done done before, but he has, you know, it's certified.
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.100]   Formalizes it.
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.100]   No, I think that's really smart.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.100]   Good for him.
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:06.100]   You have a portfolio.
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:10.700]   The other thing worth mentioning just for one second here is the other news besides new.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:16.540]   Well, you have the new Republic being sold if he's damn lucky.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.540]   You have the Philadelphia Inquirer was given to a foundation.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:20.540]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:21.540]   A nonprofit.
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.540]   Yep.
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:26.060]   They have the off post gave up on post live, which was their effort to be you and they
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:27.500]   gave that up eight hours a day.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:28.500]   It's over there.
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:29.500]   It's going to do other kinds of video.
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:34.260]   That's not good for us because that means people will say, oh, you see, there's no
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:36.540]   live is there's no hope in that.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:41.380]   But the column in the observer, which was just out today, argues that what they did was they
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.380]   tried to take us off.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.380]   It's very nice.
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:49.980]   They tried to argue that they tried to mimic TV news.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.300]   Yes, they did.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:52.540]   They really did the wrong thing.
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:58.980]   And then the fourth in this chain of sorrows is that just this afternoon, Al Jazeera America,
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.180]   not that you're going to notice is folding.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.180]   What?
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:03.180]   Yep.
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:07.620]   Because while in the ABC, they spent $500 million to buy Al Gore's current TV.
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.700]   Current TV was never figured out.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.660]   There was no need to have a TV channel for him.
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.580]   There was no need for Al Jazeera to have a TV channel.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.060]   They should have done it digitally.
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.260]   Nobody watched it.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:21.020]   They hired dull old American TV people to make a dull old American TV channel.
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.420]   But meanwhile, and here's the.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:24.220]   They could have given me a tenth of that amount.
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:25.820]   I always showed him how to do it.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.420]   Oh, and me and who care who needs a TV?
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:30.540]   Who needs channel eight hundred seventy six?
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:31.540]   It's not.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:32.540]   Right.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:36.260]   However, under the radar, of course, along came AJ+.
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:41.020]   I wrote a long time ago that that video on mobile was going to have to be a silent movie
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.780]   because you weren't going to put in your headset or play it.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.780]   I hope out loud.
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.860]   But I didn't see what was coming, which was Facebook doing.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:48.580]   The auto play was sound down.
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:52.940]   And AJ+, the digital arm of Al Jazeera Plus was brilliant.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:53.940]   Yep.
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:54.940]   In still using video.
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:56.300]   I see it all the time on my face.
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.300]   Highly informative.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:58.300]   Yep.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.300]   And so here's the number.
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:00.300]   Finally.
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.300]   Finally.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:05.540]   That's had 2.2 billion Facebook video views last year.
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:06.540]   Wow.
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:12.500]   So in the midst of the failure of Al Jazeera America, there's this little rump organization
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:16.100]   had this nice success.
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.100]   So do they do?
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.100]   What do they do?
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:19.100]   Captions?
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:20.580]   How do they handle the fact that you don't have audio?
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:25.500]   If you go to their Facebook page and pick one, you'll just see that they tell the story
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.940]   and captions or headlines or whatever you want to call them.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:29.940]   It's fine.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:30.940]   Movies.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.020]   You just don't turn the sound on, but I never turn the sound all on.
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.020]   You don't need to.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.740]   I often watch them because you don't need to.
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:39.740]   There's no, the real sound doesn't really add anything.
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:40.740]   Really?
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:41.740]   You can hear the crowd screaming.
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:43.340]   I can figure that out.
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:44.340]   Right.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:49.740]   It's really, they saw it right away.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.340]   Here's an example.
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:56.140]   And yeah, they just, so it's almost like infographics on top of video.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.140]   It's just kind of brilliant.
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.140]   Oh, cool.
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:05.580]   And because of Facebook's auto play, they got to play out of it.
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:08.180]   Yeah, those auto play numbers are rough.
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:09.820]   So you just watched two videos.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:10.820]   Right.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.340]   I mean, they probably also watched this one and this one.
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:19.340]   They just, they pump that number up as artificially as possible.
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:23.340]   It's really, it's really transparent because then somebody like this who probably does
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.940]   get some, a lot of views.
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:25.940]   A lot of views.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:27.340]   They're going to be judged to be.
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:28.340]   Don't really count it.
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:32.140]   And then the article that said half of them were 30 second views.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.140]   Right.
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:35.140]   So about half of them are fake-ish.
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:36.140]   Right.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:37.740]   30 seconds is maybe a little long.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:40.340]   But I'll take 1.1 million real ones.
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.340]   Wow, that's, I'm actually going to follow this page.
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:46.340]   Are there ads?
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.540]   Do they get money for that?
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.540]   I mean.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.940]   No, because they don't, that's the other thing about it.
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:53.740]   It's funded by the, was it the government of Gutter or?
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:57.740]   Yeah, but I mean Facebook's, Facebook's video platform.
[01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:58.740]   I never really see ads.
[01:59:58.740 --> 01:59:59.740]   They're not on these yet.
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:01.940]   Not on those video things.
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:03.420]   Huh.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:06.140]   I think with a new Facebook deal, you can sell ads.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:11.060]   There's a split, not as good a split as Google has, but you can put ads on, but that'll,
[02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:12.940]   you know, that'll have an impact on that.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.740]   Well, the next thing, so I haven't seen advertisers doing this.
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:19.220]   I've seen other news outlets copy and AJ+ and learning from that.
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:21.940]   What you haven't seen is advertisers learning from that and giving you a message without
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.340]   the need for sound.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:24.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:25.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.340]   Very interesting.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.580]   Ron and Monica, what do you got for us?
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:32.540]   A little bit of a pick?
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.820]   Yeah, I'm going to go with the TV show.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.540]   I can, I can do that, right?
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:38.540]   You can, in fact, I agree.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:41.020]   Yeah, it's the, it's called the Expanse.
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:43.740]   It's on sci-fi or the internet, which is cool.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.900]   You can just click episodes there and watch them all online, which is really neat.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:50.300]   So the Expanse is a new sci-fi series.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:54.860]   It's kind of, if you liked Battlestar Galactica and that kind of.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:55.860]   And who didn't?
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:56.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:59.380]   Like you're in the future, everybody's in outer space.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:05.820]   There's like three kind of political groups that you've been introduced to so far.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:10.940]   There's Earth and the Belters, which live in the asteroid belt and people that live
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.580]   on Mars.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:18.540]   And it's a really kind of intriguing look at what, what near space travel looks like
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:21.100]   for, for humans so far.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:22.260]   It's based on a book series.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:26.820]   So there's all sorts of, if you've read the books, which I haven't, there's all
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:32.580]   sorts of, you know, stories coming up that some people know about and some don't.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:35.020]   And more factions to introduce us to.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:37.540]   But I'm wondering if I should read the book first.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.980]   Steve Gibson loves the books.
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:41.140]   It's been very happy with the show.
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:42.140]   This is excellent.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.260]   Yeah, there's, there's only about six episodes so far, but it's, it's very interesting so
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:51.980]   far just because like there's the, the Belters have the people that live in the asteroid belt.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.460]   The gravity there is so low that they can't come back to Earth.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.140]   So they're kind of stuck there.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:04.660]   They get treated like slaves sometimes and abused by the Earth government.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:11.940]   The Martians are this kind of really hardcore, like military kind of people so far that are,
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:17.340]   they're really gung-ho about terraforming Mars into a livable atmosphere.
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:22.700]   Like right now everybody over there lives in a bubble and life is tough.
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:27.740]   And it's really, it's really intriguing and fun so far.
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:32.100]   The expanse and apparently they have just been green-lighted for a second season.
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.100]   Oh fantastic.
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:34.100]   Good.
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:39.100]   That was, that was my other worry as a, as in a Firefly fan and everything else.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.460]   I, I had been started watching this and I'm like, Oh God, this is going to be canceled
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:43.460]   soon, isn't it?
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:44.460]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:45.460]   But, uh, that's awesome.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:46.460]   Yep.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:49.340]   So you got at least two seasons of good TV to watch hopefully.
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:50.700]   Something's happened over there at sci-fi.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:52.700]   They've really upped their game.
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:55.060]   Yeah, I was shocked that this was on there.
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:57.660]   It was like super good because I had heard about it and I'm like, Oh, this is going to
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:01.220]   be on HBO or something because it's, it's pretty high budget.
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:05.940]   The special effects are decent and there's all, there's really cool technology.
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:10.740]   Everybody has a glass cell phone and like the pictures pop off of the screen a little
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:13.700]   bit and everybody shares stuff just by going like that.
[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:14.700]   Like it's really fun.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.620]   You can imagine that 10 years, five years from now, really.
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.700]   That's not so, so distant.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.860]   Yeah, I always love, I always love media like that.
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:24.900]   Like minority report and all that stuff.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:30.140]   They kind of envisions futuristic computer interfaces.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:33.900]   It's always a really fun kind of background piece to the, to the sci-fi stuff.
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:34.900]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:35.900]   I'm with you.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.900]   Uh, very good.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:41.860]   Ron is of course the, the guy to follow at ours, technically really, we love ours, technically
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.380]   in general, but his coverage.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:44.380]   And we love Ron.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:47.740]   And we love Ron and his coverage of Android is just fantastic.
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:56.860]   One of Google to read his new article, the Google playbook for 2016 at ours, technical.com.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:59.700]   Follow him on the Twitter.
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.260]   What is your Twitter handle?
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:02.260]   Uh, @Ronamaudio.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.260]   That's easy.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.260]   That's right.
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:05.260]   R-O-N-A-M-A-D-E-O.
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:06.260]   Yes.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:07.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.260]   Nice.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:09.620]   Yeah, just Google me.
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:11.460]   You'll find all sorts of stuff next up.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.220]   Like I said, next up I'm doing car stuff.
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.580]   And it's all super terrible, which is fun.
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:18.100]   That's the one I want to read.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:21.060]   And like Jeff, I'm going to be in the market soon.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.300]   We're trying to figure out.
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.100]   What are you thinking there?
[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:27.060]   You know, the Ford actually announcement got me intrigued.
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:29.620]   I love my Mustang and they have some nice stuff.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.020]   So maybe go and take a look.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:33.020]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:34.020]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:39.220]   I, you know, I'm on the, I'm on the list for Tesla X.
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.220]   But I'm.
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:43.700]   I'm thinking maybe that's a lot of money for.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:44.700]   It is.
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:45.700]   Maybe not a great car.
[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:47.780]   For driving three blocks from here.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:48.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:49.780]   I see the other thing.
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:50.780]   I could really get a truck.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:51.780]   It would be fine.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:55.620]   Don't you, don't you have your old.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:56.620]   I might tricycle.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:57.620]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:58.620]   No, no, no, no.
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:04:59.620]   Oh.
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.620]   Segway.
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:01.620]   Segways.
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.620]   Got those two.
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:03.620]   And I might get the new Segway.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.980]   When was the last time you used a Segway?
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.780]   You know, it's rainy around here.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.180]   We don't ride them much.
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:11.140]   I love the Segway.
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:12.140]   I really do.
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.980]   But it's not something you spend a lot of time on.
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:14.980]   Unless the weather is really nice.
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:18.380]   You don't want to see my graveyard.
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.540]   You must have gotten a hoverboard.
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:21.540]   Right?
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.540]   Yeah, we got a hoverboard.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:23.540]   The kid rides that around.
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.540]   Is it caught fire yet?
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:25.540]   No.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:26.540]   God, no.
[02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:29.180]   But I admit we unplug it every time we're not home.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:30.460]   Ah, good.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:37.020]   We do not want it to overheat while we're not around.
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:40.060]   Tesla Mark two though is going to be.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:42.020]   Mark three rather is going to be the inexpensive one.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.260]   But that won't be in time, I think.
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:44.260]   I don't know.
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:49.140]   But it'll be like the was it the Lone Ranger and Silver, you can whistle it'll come to
[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:50.140]   you.
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:51.140]   Yes.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.140]   From anywhere all around the country.
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:53.940]   Have you guys ridden in a Tesla?
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:57.540]   I haven't drive me around New York City like the automated driving thing.
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:58.540]   It's super terrifying.
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.540]   I haven't done that.
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:00.700]   It's so much fun.
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:01.700]   It's so awesome.
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:07.780]   I have a soft spot for Ford still after many years of sponsorship of the network.
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:08.780]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:10.340]   Maybe they'll come back.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:15.260]   I think, you know, or maybe a Lincoln, a Lincoln is a Ford.
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:18.180]   With a higher price tag.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:19.620]   That is known as just.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:23.620]   So what did you find out with the Ford about car play and Android Auto?
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:24.620]   What did you?
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:28.140]   Well, they said, I was saying three and it's, you know, I said, it's just like the Ford
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:29.140]   is it?
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:30.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:31.140]   It's just being my Ford.
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.140]   It's my Lincoln.
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.140]   Right.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:34.140]   Yeah.
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:35.820]   So it's that I was looking at the Audi Q3.
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.620]   I want the smaller higher up.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:41.980]   I was looking at the Lexus NX, which is their small one.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.500]   I can't afford the bigger one, but it's the smaller one.
[02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:47.780]   And then I said, you inspired me last week to go take a look.
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:49.340]   And it's the equivalent car.
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:51.180]   So I don't know.
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:52.980]   I could go all electric with a Ford.
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:55.620]   I could do a C max.
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:57.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:03.820]   Fords actually, they said they were licensing or they were going to be a platform and send
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   what is it?
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.820]   It's Ford MyLink.
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:09.020]   They've licensed it out to other manufacturers.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:13.860]   My link is like their app platform where you can you can start Pandora and it will it
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:16.940]   will show up on their crappy little car computer.
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:17.940]   Don't like that.
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:22.180]   And yeah, they want to license that like nobody wants that like for you're not going to be
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.500]   an app platform man.
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:24.500]   Get out.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.580]   Well, they really think they see themselves that way.
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:29.420]   That was one of the reasons they were an advertisers because they really saw themselves
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:31.900]   as a consumer electronics company.
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:38.300]   They they sounds like the typical company that is about to be disrupted and is in total denial.
[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:41.420]   Yeah, but they don't have to go for it.
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.420]   Okay.
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:43.420]   Okay.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.420]   Fair enough.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.820]   But we kick them and beat them up for not doing anything when they do something we kick
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:48.820]   them and beat them up.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:54.220]   They bought Ford and I haven't used it but when they advertised on on Twitter, they were
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:58.460]   trying right and I give them that the problem is what you it's what you said earlier.
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:03.300]   The entire industry is built for this long cycle of development and ownership and no
[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:05.980]   idea of trade you trade whole cars.
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.180]   You don't trade parts that cars should be upgradable.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.380]   Oh, would that be cool.
[02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:11.820]   These Tesla does that.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.820]   These Tesla makes things.
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:14.140]   I don't mean just software upgradeable.
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:15.820]   I mean hardware upgradeable.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:16.820]   Right.
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:20.820]   And it's a business model and it means you've got to build things to specs and sizes that
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.740]   have to last and you've got to be backward compatible and that gives them a headache.
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:26.340]   But it would make a huge difference in the industry.
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:28.180]   I suspect what they want is they don't want you to upgrade your car.
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:29.180]   They want you to trade in your car.
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.180]   Right.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:31.180]   The whole new one.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.060]   Well, they know that that model is not is dying.
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.060]   I think it is.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:36.540]   Car personal ownership of cars is going to go away.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:37.540]   Hey, we got to run.
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.220]   You guys have been here long enough.
