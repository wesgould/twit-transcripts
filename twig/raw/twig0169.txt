[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Aaron Nukem, joins Jeff and Gina and me to talk about all the latest Google News, our response to Apple's announcements and what Google might be announcing on Monday.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And a look at the new Samsung Chromebook. Is it the hottest things in sliced bread or just another Vic 20? It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and the cloud. I want to hasten to say.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Sometimes people go, "Wait a minute, you're not talking about Google." It's all the stuff in the cloud.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Facebook, Twitter, whatever's going on. And the reason is when you get a panel this good, you don't want to say, "Oh no, you can't talk about George Deque.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Joining us right now for that fly. Joining us right now to my left, Gina Trippani. Mommy, Gina.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm Tk lover. Tk lover.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yes, Gina is of course the founding editor of Life Hacker. She blogs at smartaward.org and writes, "Think up a partner for expert labs with Neil Dash.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Good to see you." Good to be here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You look well rested once again.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Not today, it was a long night.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   My daughter's five weeks.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   The honeymoon is over. I'm party for you. Oh man.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Aaron Newcom is also here from Oracle in the Source Show and you're a father, right?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm still three kids. How old?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Let's see. I got to remember, 13, 10 and 7.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Oh geez. So we're out of diapers. We're beyond the late night or early morning.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You've been where Gina is. I've been there many times.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Many times.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I remember doing laps with Abby when she was that age, just trying to jiggle her to sleep.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Right?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah, pacing. Pacing work.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Pacing motion. Yeah, motion.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Also here, the father of us all, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I don't know why I said that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Jeff is the author of "What Would Google Do?" and his new book, "Public Parts."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh my.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Also at George2Kfannyblogs@buzzmachine.com and teaches journalism to some very lucky kids
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   at the City University of New York. Hello everybody.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You know, there's a lot of interest in this new Chromebook.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I don't, it sold out already and I am in its kind of puzzle.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   All right. Can I, can I start it in here?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Please.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I ordered it on the 18th. I am enraged today.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Never happens. I never got mad about anything.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Because it hasn't arrived from Best Buy order from Best Buy because you could order from there.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You couldn't order from Google Play at first.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Right? So I went to Best Buy order immediately.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's now supposed to be back ordered.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Somebody else who ordered it out.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Sold out.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So on Google Play, two days ago, just got it today and brag about it on Google Plus.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's killing me.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Here's the deal. Here's the deal.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I have gone to my Nexus phone.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I have gone to my Nexus 7 tablet.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I am going, for the purposes of the show, for the benefit of the show, I'm going to go 100% Google.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Oh wow.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I'm going to live Google.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh wow.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   There's only one thing I can't do if I live Google.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Skype.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Skype.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Because that Chromebook you have to use a Hangout.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We could use a Hangout, right?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Chat?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Can we try it?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah. The biggest problem at the moment is the drivers that we use for video back to you don't work.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   You won't be able to see us.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You won't be able to see us.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   We'll solve that.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We'll just take them.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And we actually won't use a Hangout.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We'll use Google Talk.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Right?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Oh, Google Talk.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Google Talk will work perfect.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You could use Google Talk in the Chromebook, right?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yes.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Okay.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   All right.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So I realized for $249, right?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I can pretty much do anything that I need to do.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And by the way, anything that a journalism student would need to do too.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I think you can edit video, you can edit photos, you can publish, you can do all kinds of things.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And I think it's potentially a breakthrough.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You know, you compare that to the new Chromebook.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   iPad.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But the new, I know the Power Walk.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   MacBook Pro.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   MacBook Pro.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Talking almost.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You an old timer, the what?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Ten times the price.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Ten times you can get ten croats for the price of the iPhone.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's right.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Actually, we observed that yesterday during the announcement.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   The 13 inch retina MacBook Pro is, well, not ten.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Almost $16.99.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Well, but the time you added all the other stuff, you're up to $22.300 for the price of the
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   high end of it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Boy, be it obvious to me.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Well, you're not getting high end.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You're getting very low end.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That's what puzzles me.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Now, it looks like a MacBook Air.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And maybe that's what deceiving people.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Did you get the 3G model?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Or did you get a what?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I'm so eager to get it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I've ordered both.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I have people at Best Buy neither the 12.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Five, they're cheap.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It was exactly.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I've heard one.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You couldn't order the 3G at first.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And then Amazon quietly had a lot of you to do that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So I'll get that if needed.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So here's what you're getting.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   For $250, it's an Exynos processor, which is basically the same processor used in many Android
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   phones.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Dual-core.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   They don't say a clock speed.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They're getting a 11.6 inch screen.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   That's 1366 by 768, which means, and they have mentioned this, it'll play back HD 720p, but
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   HD video.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Low glare.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   200 nits.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Everybody's talking nits all of a sudden.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Nits here.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Nits there.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I don't know why.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's got a VGA webcam.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   So you're going to look awful.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's 640 by 480, right?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Blue.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Two and a half pounds, 2.4 pounds.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Like I don't always look awful.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   They're pink or pixelated on the show.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.800]   Well, you won't be pixelated, but you'll be, you'll look like you're talking to us from
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Azerbaijan.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.520]   Two gigs of RAM, 16 gig drive.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.920]   That would be the concern for some people.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.000]   There's no, it's all cloud storage, right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Wi-Fi, ABG.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.360]   The 100 gigs of free Google drive.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.640]   100 gigs of storage.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.800]   Bluetooth 3, USB 3, which is interesting.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.880]   USB 2 HDMI and SD card reader.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.560]   And they're claiming six and a half hours battery life on the Wi-Fi version.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.360]   You may actually be able to plug in a webcam.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.560]   Yeah, I think I'll be able to plug in this webcam.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   Because it's USB.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.600]   So maybe we'll, that's a good point, Chad.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.960]   You are right on it.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.040]   So, you're buying it because you're a journalist.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Why would you?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.440]   No, I'm buying it for another reason.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.540]   What do I do?
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   What do I do?
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.780]   I'm 99.9% of my time on my computer.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.780]   Browser.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.780]   Right.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.780]   That's really is all I do.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.260]   And I'm trying to go to Google Docs anyway rather than writing a word just so I have
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.420]   the stuff available wherever I am or whatever machine and whatever device I can use this,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420]   right?
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.100]   With Docs, I can't use Word.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.820]   You know what, finally I said in the show two weeks ago that what drove me to Android
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.500]   was Google's services.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.420]   Drove me to the hardware.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.820]   When I finally made the switch to calendar and drive and all that stuff, I just said,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.820]   well, why not?
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:59.540]   Now, yeah, the next step of this is if I can do everything I need to do for $249 in hardware,
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.820]   then the students at my school, we required a buy, a Mac laptop.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.060]   If they could buy this thing, if we could create more of an open source journalism school,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.460]   yeah, $249 makes a big deal.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.840]   It's not the one laptop per child and which isn't very good.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   It really does most of what anybody needs to do.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.200]   It says we fully live in the cloud.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   This is the cloud show.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.500]   So I got to live in the cloud band and we fully live on the browser as the pathway to
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   it.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   Gina, am I insane?
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.420]   I don't think you're insane.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.340]   Kevin Purdy and I discuss this all the time.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.980]   And he said, you know, I spend my days in my browser or writing, you know, writing in
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.480]   Docs.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.020]   And he, I believe he ran Life Hacker, I think for like a week just using Chrome OS.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.620]   And he and he said, wow, how ever did he survive?
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.520]   What happened after seven days?
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.240]   Well, you know, he was kind of, he went back to the--
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   That's not a successful trial.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.140]   I got to tell you, he said himself, he said himself up and said, I'm going to just try
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.440]   and use just this computer for-- and he did this a while ago when it was back when it
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.520]   was like the CR 48.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.040]   This was, this was kind of a while ago.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.880]   But he said, you know, I wanted to see if I could do it.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.000]   And the answer was that, you know, that he absolutely could.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.480]   And obviously not having so much fun that he decided to keep doing it.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   Well, right.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.120]   Yeah, I don't think he works from a Chrome OS, but he, he works from Linux, which is
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.560]   basically he just spent this time.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.720]   There's a significant difference.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.660]   Can I just say this is completely retro?
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.180]   We've been here, we've done this before.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.820]   It was called a netbook.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.660]   And because of the very, very, very cheap price similar to this, a lot of people bought
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.140]   them and put them away after about three months saying that was a lousy experience.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.900]   And the same thing, I don't understand why this is different.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.340]   True, but the difference is--
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.900]   We didn't have the service.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.740]   Windows was just really heavy and not built for this low-powering.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.140]   Chrome OS is built for this machine.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.140]   This machine is fast.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.700]   It turns on really fast.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.180]   It's just, it's much more lightweight.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.940]   Look, I can't switch it to a Chromebook just because I like my IDE.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   I do development.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.780]   That's how I'm writing code most of the day.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.220]   I know there are cloud-based code editors, but I got to run my tests.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.820]   I've got my sort of tools on the desktop that I aren't quite offered in the cloud yet.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.060]   But I'm not, I think most people who spend their time in the browser, I think that it's
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.060]   reasonable.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.540]   For journalism students, the Chromebook makes complete sense.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.540]   I'm actually surprised.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.140]   Jeff, you require students to buy a Mac?
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.140]   That's pretty expensive.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.700]   I don't, I know.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.740]   Around UCSD, I see most students with Windows laptops and I--
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   Oh, don't forget.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.740]   --that's a price.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.180]   Right, we're teaching students to make video for TV and such and make audio and photos.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.820]   They need to learn Final Cut, the Adobe Suite and all that.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.580]   What we do is we had a lot of discussion about this.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.060]   It requires a student to buy a Mac when we're a city university.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.580]   We have students, though, from across the country.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.340]   We are a state-supported public university.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.260]   But a lot of schools require technology and require technology fees.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.180]   What we do to soften this load quite a bit is we provide free use while they're at the
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.740]   school of an incredible array of software, including Final Cut, including the Adobe Suite
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.740]   and much more.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.780]   Though, interestingly, that software has shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and shrunk because we've
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.340]   had more online tools.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.340]   Right, right.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.220]   But I think this is great for businesses who have gone the Google Apps route.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.060]   I mean, if I were a small business and I first of all, I would be on Google Apps because
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060]   it's so easy.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.740]   And then I would give every single one of my employees the day you come, you get this
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.420]   as a laptop and use this because you've got offline access to docs.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.700]   Except in the corner case where you are doing things like video editing and whatever.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   I think this is great for that.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.540]   And I also think it's really good for education.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.780]   So I agree with Leo.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.500]   I've never been a big fan of Chromebook.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.340]   But at this price point and with all of the marketing they're doing around this, I was
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.180]   seeing ads I think during the playoffs for the Chromebook.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.340]   I was really surprised how much they're doing to promote that.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.220]   The new commercial is great.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.420]   It's for everyone, that commercial.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   It's a cut together of a bunch of YouTube clips.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.300]   I think it's a big fat lie.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.500]   Seriously, I do.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.940]   And I think people, I think it's going to be, we've seen this so many times before.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.060]   The Commodore 64 was very popular because it was very cheap.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.580]   And then people got it home and realized why it was so cheap.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.380]   The netbooks are very popular because they were very cheap that people got the home.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.460]   And I'm going to get the calls in six months from people who say, "Oh, computing, it's
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.260]   so horrible because it's just so slow."
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   I just don't, you know what?
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.860]   I had this argument, by the way.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.580]   I've had this argument with the guy, what was his name in charge of Chrome OS at Google?
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.180]   I stood across from him and said, "I don't get it."
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.180]   So where?
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.420]   Yeah, I don't get it.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.780]   I don't think you have a product here.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.000]   Now, I do have to point out that Michael Horowitz at Computer World, he writes the
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.340]   defensive computing column, says that Chrome OS is a great choice for online finances.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.500]   This might make sense as kind of a standalone secondary computer.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.700]   I know people who use Linux for that.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.580]   Just buy the side of the phone or whatever.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.860]   It's completely secure that you just use for things you really want to be secure with.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.860]   That's Sundar Pachai.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   Sundar Pachai.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.860]   That's it.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.860]   Sundar Pachai.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860]   But Leo, okay.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.860]   But two things have changed.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.020]   Anki Leo.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.500]   One is the quality of the services that are in the cloud, this being the show about the
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.500]   cloud.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   When you think about it, it's really amazing.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.060]   When we get to Gena's, she'll be mentioning some other services that are available now.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.780]   It's constantly growing, it's constantly there.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.700]   It's not just, you know, we video, you can edit video in the cloud and the rendering is
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   not asked.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.820]   But who would want to do that when you can buy a good computer for a couple of years?
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.820]   I think it's a little bit more than a much more.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   That doesn't really.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.020]   Well, A, here's why you can do the rendering, which is the biggest pain in the butt of video
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.100]   editing in a much faster machine than the cloud.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:43.180]   So when you upload, you pay for the speed once by uploading and then you gain back speed.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.420]   Number two, you can bring in other clips and other things and collaborate just like we
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.420]   do on docs.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.820]   You can do the same thing with video only if it's in the cloud.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   Right?
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.820]   That's the big change.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.860]   The other change is with my iPad.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.460]   And now with this, I'm working with a keyboard.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.260]   I'm turning my tablet into a computer and that's where Microsoft is going.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260]   I never got that either, to be honest.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.540]   But at least you have touch with that and some mature applications.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.980]   Maybe, you know what?
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.180]   I'm just registering my skepticism.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.180]   Perhaps this will be wonderful.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.940]   Perhaps it will take off.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.740]   I think we've seen this story lots of times before.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.820]   Gina, Gina, this is sucker-boom.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   Sucker-boom.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.820]   For real people.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.660]   I think we should challenge Leo to live on Chrome.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.660]   I've tried.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.660]   I had a CR-48.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.660]   I've had every crumb.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.660]   Oh, well.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.660]   And I tried.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.660]   It's a browser.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.940]   And I just can't get past the fact that all I have is a browser.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.020]   What other applications do you use every day?
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.820]   What are you using, Leo, like besides your browser during the day?
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.380]   A ton of stuff.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:49.340]   Like Twitter, email.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.340]   I use a standalone email client.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.340]   I'm not going to use Gmail.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.980]   I never use Gmail in the browser.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.740]   It was a AOL grandpa?
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.740]   No, no.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.380]   I use Apple Mail.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.060]   And I use a lot of sophisticated filtering and stuff that I'm not going to be able to
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.980]   do on the Gmail website.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.060]   I use IRC chat textual.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.100]   I use a lot of different apps.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.700]   I don't actually do video editing, but I wouldn't dream of doing it on the-- you know, go ahead.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   Live it up.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.260]   Get back to me in a month and let me know how well you're-- how it's going for you.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.940]   The only reason I'm aggressive on this-- because otherwise I don't care.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.340]   The only reason I'm aggressive on this is because I think that unfortunately consumers
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:33.340]   look at the price and go, hey, a computing experience for $2.49, I'll take it.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340]   And it's in the closet.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.340]   And I've just seen this so many times before.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.140]   Google's being careful, I think, to position it as a second machine, as a traveling machine
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.140]   and stuff.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.140]   I mean, let me-- I don't think so.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.740]   I look at that ad and they're positioning it as a-- you're going to love life when you
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.260]   have this great machine and you're going to do neat things and it's so much fun and even
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.100]   you're talking compute.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.860]   Is it a mom's machine?
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.860]   No.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.860]   If not enough.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.940]   The less sophisticated the user is, the more power they need, not the less power.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.500]   A sophisticated user can understand how all this works and make it work.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.100]   My father uses AOL.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.100]   If this were an AOL machine--
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.100]   It doesn't run AOL.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.500]   Well, you know what I mean.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   And it's the more--
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.460]   That's-- don't deprecate that because that's my point is for geeks like us, being living
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.100]   in Chrome, maybe is doable, but there are real people out there who are going to spend
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.100]   $49 and it's a waste of their money, I think.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   But we'll see.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100]   I mean, I may be completely wrong.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.300]   This would be the first.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.500]   There've been many, many, many generations of these machines who have tried to do this.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.100]   But the price point-- the changes in the background and the price point makes a big
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.100]   difference.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.100]   Remember Think Inc?
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.660]   The little company that your boss started?
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.900]   Some years ago Oracle had a-- it was a network computer.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   It was a--
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.660]   There was a lot of these around that time.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.820]   I've seen this again and again and again.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.900]   And each and every time people say the same thing, which is, well, it's not there yet.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.900]   Maybe it's there now.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.900]   Maybe?
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.900]   Maybe?
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.900]   Maybe?
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.900]   That's the right--
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   It reminds me when I went with the Daily News.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.700]   They say, I want to do something new and they'd say-- the Daily News and they say, no, we tried
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.700]   that 54, right?
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.700]   You're--
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   No.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   Go ahead.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   You want to try it.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   We tried it five, six times.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   It hasn't worked.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.700]   What did you think?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.140]   I wouldn't care except that I just feel like a lot of people are going to be taken for
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   a while.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   I think that's fair.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.620]   I think that's very fair that you are doing copy on your own career.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.620]   I think that you were trying to break in my--
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.060]   No, I was just going to ask about saying that less the less sophisticated the user, the
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.860]   more power that they need.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.860]   That's interesting to me, Leo.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.860]   I don't know.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.860]   Why do you say that?
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.860]   That doesn't seem--
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.860]   It's always good.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.780]   Because to me, I see the Mac is a luxury computer and the Chromebook is less power computer.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.620]   If I wasn't a developer, if I was just writing or if I was a student, I totally see going
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.780]   to school with a Chromebook.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.420]   If I was just writing papers and doing it mostly everything in my browser.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.060]   I think what happens is-- it's very frequently the case that the least sophisticated users
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.580]   by the cheapest computers ends up having been a mistake because it doesn't do what they
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.340]   need it to do.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.220]   They're not sophisticated enough to figure out the ways to get it to do video editing.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.220]   Good luck.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.820]   I'm a consumer.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.820]   I have a camera.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.060]   I have a video camera or maybe I have a still camera.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.580]   Now I have a Chromebook.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.860]   What I'd like to do is send grandma the pictures.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.060]   How easy is that going to be?
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.020]   It has a slot for your memory card.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.860]   You put it in there, you email the picture to grandma.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.300]   Let's see.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.500]   I have to say I agree with Leo on this for the most part.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.780]   I really want to love the Chromebook.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.940]   My wife, after seeing the commercials, who is not into technology at all, came and asked
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.100]   me, "I just saw this commercial.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.060]   Is this something I could use?"
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.660]   I said, "No, it's not for you."
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.940]   The reason that you just said Leo is that she's always getting stuff from other people.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.340]   She's always using Microsoft products or other products.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.780]   Then she goes, "Because she runs Linux because I make her run Linux."
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:59.380]   Sometimes she's not able to do things on Linux.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.420]   You're like Bill Gates's kids.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.180]   We have to use a Zoom because Daddy won't let us have an iPad.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.300]   That's like the scene out of Diner where he wouldn't marry Mary.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   That's right.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:16.340]   You had your wife do a coding test before you'd marry her all bad.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.500]   I don't think she had such a good idea.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.260]   She definitely wouldn't pass that one.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260]   Here's the video.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.340]   I got to point out 394,000 views on YouTube.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:34.700]   I just want people to watch this and see who Google is targeting with this product and
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.020]   ask yourself whether those people are going to take it home and say, "Yeah, this was
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.020]   great a year from now."
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:48.260]   So that kid's not going to be able to run any of the educational software she wants
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   to run.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.380]   Go ahead and give a kid a Chromebook and say, "Watch TV."
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.140]   A lazy Sunday.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.140]   A guy's sleeping.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.980]   I guess it's perfect for him.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.980]   Homework?
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.980]   No, I don't think so.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   You got plucks?
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.020]   Can you watch Netflix on it?
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.020]   Yes.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.460]   It's good for a Saint Bernard, I agree.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.460]   The number of apps is very impressive.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:24.220]   Okay, so you got a kid entering high school, freshman in high school.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.220]   Now assuming price is no object.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.820]   Well, that's a key point.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.820]   I understand.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.460]   But the cake falls over that.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.340]   Well, but there's a false economy is my point.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.860]   $50 wasted is not better than $500 on a computer that actually does something.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.700]   It's wasted and you'll end up buying the $500 computer.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.380]   So it's an expensive economy.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.420]   So if you got a kid entering high school from eighth grade, what do you get?
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   That kid, you get a Chromebook?
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:58.100]   Yeah, I mean if she doesn't take care of stuff well, or he, you know, the kid is like
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.100]   eats up.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.620]   If she's going to break it, that's good.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.620]   That's a good person.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.940]   If I want his or her stuff to be everywhere enough to worry about backing stuff up, sure.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940]   Right?
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.780]   Yeah, or you put a backup program on there.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.380]   I don't, it's not that hard.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.380]   All right.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.860]   Well, we'll talk again in six months.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.860]   Well, we'll see.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.740]   Well, I hope I get my machine before that.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.260]   Well, I want to be a bit of a good opportunity.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.260]   You do too.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.820]   Now they've sold out because that doesn't mean that we don't know how many.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.820]   I ordered it as soon as I could.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.420]   Yeah, you ordered from the wrong people.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   I don't get it.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.420]   Apple does the same thing.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.460]   They allocate like five to Best Buy and then they sell the rest.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   Here's the thing though.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.180]   You couldn't order it on play right away.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.820]   So I wouldn't have ordered it on play, but you couldn't for days and I didn't know when
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.820]   it was going to go in play.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.940]   So I went to the first place I could buy it and frankly, I'll be out fully honest here.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.100]   I thought if there's a problem I can return to Best Buy.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.100]   By the way, it's interesting.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:22:00.100]   They're pitching this as being able to play back 1080p video, even though it's, it's only
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.100]   a 768 screen.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.540]   I don't understand that.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.180]   I think Google's a little disingenuous on this.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.460]   I know they really all in on the Chromebook and all that.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.300]   Maybe they feel like they're doing people a real favor.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.460]   I worry that they're doing people a disservice, but I bet I could be wrong.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.860]   And I'm actually would be happy to be wrong.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.020]   You know, I bought the one laptop per child, you know, about the, you know, I mean, I think
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.900]   that's a really, I'm excited about it.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.620]   I bought every netbook that ever came out.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.700]   That was a, I still have my Asus EPC and I've owned every Chromebook up to this one.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.540]   In fact, Chad, we, we had you review them.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.540]   I reviewed it.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.900]   How many are you, which one are you using now?
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.300]   Well, we had to return the, the, the newest one.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.300]   So the old one is.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   We have plenty of those.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.100]   We got them at Google IO, didn't we?
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.820]   You got the Chrome box at Google IO.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   Oh, Chrome box.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.180]   To Google, the Google IO before the last they gave us a Chromebook.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.820]   And that was the, that was the first generation.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   That wasn't the C.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.820]   Right.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.420]   And then the, the one that they're still doing on that one.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   That one's a piece of crap.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   Right.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.420]   There was zero 48 and there was the Samsung.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   Right.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   Right.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   And I had the Samsung.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.700]   Um, and, and the chat room saying, Leah, why would you do a show about Google when you're
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.700]   so ignorant?
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.580]   They're saying, uh, so we'll just see.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.820]   We'll talk again in a few months.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.420]   I think it's important to be critical.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.620]   I think it's important to be critical of these things.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.620]   For sure.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.620]   Absolutely.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.540]   Adiot analyst says Google could be gone in five years.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.540]   Now that's a guy I can get behind.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:33.900]   He's somebody on Twitter said, I can't wait to hear Jarvis rail about this on twigs.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.580]   Katie Thompson on CNBC.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.420]   She's the technology editor.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.700]   Google may be on its way out as the dominant player in search according to one analyst.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.700]   It's not Katie.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.660]   She's writing about, uh, I was going to say the analyst had the idiot analyst have to
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   be a lady.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   Come on.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   Eric Jackson, a nice fella.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.660]   Uh, iron fire iron fire capital founder and managing med member.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:06.780]   I don't know if I'd want my title to be member, but anyway, he said Google could easily find
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.340]   itself fending off the woes.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.380]   It eventually took hold of them battled Yahoo.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.300]   They could disappear in five to eight years in the same way that Yahoo disappeared.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   They're still around with it.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   They're walking dead.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.020]   Actually, I don't know if he's really wrong on that.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.900]   No, no, that's, listen, that's patently true.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   Any company Facebook.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   Any company.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   Right.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   Twitter.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.900]   Any company could disappear.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.580]   You had said that about Microsoft people who thought you nuts.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.580]   Mm hmm.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.580]   Yep.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.580]   Yep.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.580]   So absolutely could happen.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.820]   I don't disagree with that, but the rationale, it's the now, it's the mobile boogie man.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.220]   Nobody's figured out mobile.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.020]   Uh, well, that's why the stock market punished Google.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020]   Yes.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.660]   By killing his stock price five, four or five percent, right?
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.660]   Right.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:50.100]   Because Google had admitted accidentally that, uh, that 40% of what they're making 40% less
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.500]   on mobile than on desktop.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   I think that's what they said.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.540]   It's beginning to get $8 billion, $8 billion revenue on mobile.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.740]   They're still doing okay.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.980]   And Amazon and Facebook, which everybody's been screaming the same thing when, when they
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.540]   had the hearings call this week, it turns out, yeah, we are learning how to sell mobile.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.980]   They've, you know, hundreds of millions still, but you know, smaller than Google, and their
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.020]   stock went up 12% today, I think.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.980]   And by the way, Yahoo had some profits too.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.980]   Mm hmm.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   Yahoo did okay.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980]   Yep.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980]   I have 20% for Facebook.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.980]   See.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.020]   I don't, I don't think the basic premise here is, is, is wrong.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.580]   Any company can go under.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:32.020]   Um, and we've seen it with a lot of internet companies, but I just don't think that the
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.100]   comparisons that he's, this person's pointing out are fair.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.820]   Um, who's he comparing him to?
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.820]   Besides, yeah.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.540]   Facebook, he says if Facebook saw a deceleration of their sales and growth leading to half
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.420]   of their stock, why couldn't this happen to Google?
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.420]   Right.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   Well, Google is diversified.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.420]   Right.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   Much more than Facebook.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.420]   Like the comparison is not valid.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.980]   Yes, that's true, but it is purely an advertising company, which we, you know, we have to say
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.780]   in media, you know, is a problem.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.500]   Well, but I mean, but why would based on, is he projecting that ad revenues are going
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   away or anything?
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.820]   You know, I mean, they project is that you can't get the same kind of revenue and mobile
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.660]   as, as traffic moves to mobile, then you can't get the same revenue there that you
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:18.420]   get in the, in, in, um, browsers, uh, on the web, you know, PCs and that that's lower.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   But I think what that mistakes is that Facebook has said this, I can't worry, I said this is
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.700]   the same as true Google and I'm sorry.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.700]   I've said it a million times.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.860]   Let's say one more time.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.540]   This is a signal generator and it teaches you about people as long as the federal trade
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.900]   commission doesn't stop in you from take advantage of that, then Google and Facebook
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.260]   will know more about you than any media company knows and can take higher advantage of it.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.900]   They've only barely begun to do that.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.780]   Google's father had been Facebook is Facebook, however, but we'll know you more intimately.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.740]   And that's what we haven't seen yet.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.740]   And then they could, listen, they may fail at it.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.260]   They may not do it, but there's a potential there that I would, I would invest in it.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:56.980]   If you had to put, uh, all your money in one company right now and say, you know, survive
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.380]   10 years out, would it be Google?
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.380]   Gina.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.660]   That's a really good question.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.420]   Uh, 10 years.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.420]   Mm.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   That's really hard in technology.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.420]   10 years of lifetime.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.660]   Yeah, that's a long time.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.660]   That's a long time.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660]   Apple?
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.500]   Will Apple be is no, I don't think Apple will be around 10 years.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.100]   Uh, yeah, I would split between Apple and Google.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:27.420]   Facebook, Microsoft, or is there somebody not in incumbent who could, uh, completely change
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.420]   the game again?
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.780]   We've seen that so many times in technology.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   There's always someone.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.180]   There's always somebody out there.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.180]   There's always someone.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.060]   And I think what, I think what is true is that a few years ago, you'd say, well, there's
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.300]   no one that can compete against Google and search because Google's has years of building
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.460]   this index that there is some real value to that.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.860]   Nobody could just, you know, and we saw a lot of companies try like cool.com.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.260]   And you can't just march in and be the next Google.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.060]   But what's changed is that search isn't the big thing anymore.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.060]   Search isn't the big thing.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.260]   That's social is the thing.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.260]   Right.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.260]   So that's why it's unpredictable.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.300]   And something else comes along next, but that's why I think what Google has proved nimble
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.460]   at is pivoting to these new opportunities.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.980]   Who would have thought they'd be a phone company?
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.440]   Whereas Microsoft, which was going to be, you know, was so unstoppable that governments
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.400]   around the world were going after them and was unbeatable, you know, didn't pivot so
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   well.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.120]   Facebook is still trying to understand how to do this.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.600]   I think I think I think Larry Page and Google have shown a skill at that that I would bet
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   on.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   But the key word you the key thing you said, you know, the limitation of this is 10 years
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.080]   when I've been on them for 20 years or 50 years.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   No, I'd be foolish.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   For sure.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   By for sure.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.880]   By then somebody will have come along and come up with something new.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   Maybe.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   Maybe.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   I always go to IBM.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.640]   IBM is not around the world the way it did.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.360]   But IBM is full of good company.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.840]   AT&T is still around.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   That's a old company.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   For sure.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   Kind of.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.480]   It's a different company than it was.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   Brand.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.680]   You know, I think the problem is that we as humans don't really have we live in this
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.160]   very weird bubble where we don't really see time and we're like fish in the water.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.400]   We don't see the water.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.560]   And so we don't we think everything will always be the way it is until it's not.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.160]   And boy, if there's ever a lesson in all of this, everything's changing.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.160]   Absolutely.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.600]   Beyond our ability to grok it.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   Yeah, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.680]   Gina Trappani, Jeff Jarvis and Aaron Nukem is with us as well from the source show.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   Sure show.net.org.org.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   Org.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   Org.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680]   So show.org.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.560]   And of course he's a regular on Floss Weekly.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.720]   You were here for Floss this morning.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   I was here.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   I hosted Floss this morning.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   What would you do this morning?
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.880]   We were talking about actually a company that does embedded develops a build system for
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   embedded arm devices.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   It actually fits in very well with the Talk About Chromebook.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.320]   If you're interested in more talk about arm technology and how do you write code for arm,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   check it out.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   That's an interesting question.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.440]   At some point is arm going to be Intel?
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.480]   And arm isn't a thing really.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.240]   Arm is just a IP.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.040]   I mean, it's the chips that drive most of the mobile technology out there.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.040]   But they don't even make the chips.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.800]   It's a standard or a spec.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.640]   Yeah, it's a fine stuff.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   But the cool thing was you talked about technology.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:13.840]   They actually have a rack-mountable chassis basically.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   I want to call it a server.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   I guess it's a server.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   But it has a bunch of these different arm chips in it.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.080]   And that's what they're using to actually run their compiling system and their system
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.680]   that they use to compile for embedded Linux systems.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.640]   And it's an eight chips.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.040]   Each one is quad core.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   And each one has 30 gigs of flash memory mounted on top of it.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   It's crazy.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.880]   But they're building this all on an arm architecture.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.440]   It's very, very interesting to me.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.400]   No, I-- who would have thought a few years ago that Intel would not-- would be kind
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.200]   of faced with this big challenge.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.000]   And that's because people moved to mobile.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.640]   The desktop is no longer dominant.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   Right.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   Taking a break.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.040]   Come back with more in just a bit.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.480]   Gina, Jeff, and Aaron, do you-- do you mail stuff?
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   Do you-- now, this is not-- do you mail a letter every once in a while?
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.680]   Do you mail stuff?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.400]   Like, we mail stuff.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.160]   We have to mail out invoices.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.680]   We have to mail out products.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.760]   We're always mailing stuff.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   You go to the front desk.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   There's always a pile this high.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.800]   That's why we use stamps.com.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   If you mail stuff with a capital M, you don't want to go to the post office arms laden down.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.840]   You don't want to buy stamps at the post office.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   And let me tell you something.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.520]   You might have thought, oh, the postage meter is a godsend.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.840]   That's whale fashion technology.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.520]   You want stamps.com or places.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.040]   No, you don't need a postage meter.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.360]   You don't need expensive leasing or special ink or any equipment.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.760]   You need your computer, your printer, and stamps.com.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.600]   You can buy and print a US postage.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.920]   It's kind of a postage on demand.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.040]   Anytime anywhere, they also print the mailing labels.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.720]   They print right on an envelope, which makes it very easy to get your mailing done.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.000]   In fact, it'll take it from your existing address book.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   Use QuickBooks.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.960]   All the clients in there.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.520]   Blah, just spits it out and put your logo on there that postage everything.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.480]   I just-- it's so cool.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.440]   And with stamps.com USB scale, you're never putting more postage on anything than you ever
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   have to.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.560]   You just plop the letter or the package on the scale.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.760]   It goes into the-- it's USB.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   It goes into the computer.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   It goes to the software.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.240]   It does the prints out the mailing label for you.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   You're set.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.120]   If you use-- if you're an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, Etsy, PayPal, any of those,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.080]   it will take the address of the buyer from the website.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.320]   You don't have to type it in.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.480]   Takes everything you need from the website, fills out the forms.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.520]   If you're doing international mail, you even get discounts.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   You can't get to the post office.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.000]   Because truthfully, the post office loves stamps.com.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.840]   They want-- what's-- what's not to love?
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.800]   You don't have to come to the post office anymore.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   It saves them money.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:47.640]   So that's why they give you 21% off to 21% off on ExpressML to 15% on priority mail.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   I want you to try this.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   Now, I have a special offer.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:55.040]   If you go to stamps.com, you're going to see $80 bonus, $25 free postage and a scale
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   and all that stuff.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   Don't do that.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   I can do better.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.120]   See that microphone in the upper right hand corner?
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.280]   You click that and use Twig as our offer code.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.440]   And we want you to use Twig so that we get credit for the Gee Nun Jeff and they get
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.360]   big raises.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.040]   And if you see my face, then you're in the right place because you'll see that offer
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.360]   now no longer $80.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.440]   It's $110 bonus offer.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.040]   They've added $3 and free-- you get $55 free postage.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.200]   You get the digital scale.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.880]   All you do is pay $5 shipping and handling for that.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.000]   You get a $5 supply kit to make up for it and a four-week trial of stamps.com.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.320]   Never go to the post office again.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   We like it so much.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.600]   We have two accounts here because we're fighting over the scale.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   Stamps.com.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.560]   Use our offer code Twig for that's very special.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.400]   Offer with $55 and free postage.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.800]   This is a really interesting week.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.720]   So Apple announced on Tuesday like a ton of new products, like more than anybody ever
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.560]   thought they would.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.760]   Every product in their product line now has been revamped except the Mac Pro, which speaks
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.720]   a little bit to the end of desktop computing I think, but we'll save that for Mac break
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.680]   weekly.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.360]   Tomorrow Microsoft's having a party in New York for Windows 8 and then Friday the Windows
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.520]   8 store opens.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.200]   People are going to be able to buy Windows 8 computers, desktops, but also Microsoft's
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.360]   new tablet.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   I've ordered one.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   I can't wait to take a look at it.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.040]   The reviews are very interesting.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:30.240]   Well, almost in every case reviewers had something very positive to say like this thing's amazing.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.000]   This thing's so cool, but there's no software.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.640]   Even Walt Mossberg praised it highly.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.160]   Some of which I wonder is because people feel like they can't really just slam it, right?
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.120]   They have to say find something good.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.920]   Who'd think we have empathy and sympathy for Microsoft?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.680]   It's almost like, oh gosh, I find something good to say.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:59.120]   Well, it's a very attractive box because they feel bad.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.600]   And then we've got big announcements next week.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:09.480]   Microsoft's got its Windows Phone 8 announcement in San Francisco next week and Samsung's got
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.400]   big announcements next week.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.880]   And then Google says, add it away.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:21.160]   They shove their shoe horn their way into the Monday calendar with a surprise announcement.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   It's not so surprising.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.200]   It's all because of Christmas, right?
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.960]   Yeah, it's a molecule.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.440]   It's a couple, right?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.440]   Quanza.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.960]   But I don't remember this ever happening before.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.760]   This is the first.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.440]   And I guess it's because we have all these companies competing with inexpensive devices.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.640]   Which yeah, this is exciting and new.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   I love it.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.600]   And it goes back a bit to the Chromebook discussion is that we're not talking at $2,500 price
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   points now.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:54.240]   We're talking at $250 out of the pocket to get a new phone with subsidy to get a tablet
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   to get all these things.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   It's amazing.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.160]   So the rumor mill just as the rumor mill has been very active with Apple is is I saw
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.640]   what was it read right web that wrote everything Google will announce everything Google announce
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.240]   on Monday is right here.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   I don't know if that's the case, but we're going to see what they think a Nexus a new
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.760]   next phone from LG, who nexus choices, which is great.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.160]   There was a rumor of a Sony one, but that appears to be that was a fake.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.520]   That was a total fake.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520]   It was a total fake.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   In fact, it was such a fake that the guy who did the fake posted a tumbler on how he
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.040]   did the fake.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.200]   It was such a fake.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.440]   There is no Sony Nexus.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:43.840]   It was it was it's actually another one of those lessons for this for the tech press that
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.000]   you just got to be a little bit more careful.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.200]   Phone arena, which picked this up like big time actually had to apologize.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.000]   The they called it the failure of our reporting.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.120]   That's how I heard about it through phone arena through the failure of their report.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   Yes.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.640]   Meanwhile, somebody is saying, Oh crap, maybe we should do that.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   Well, it was.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:11.760]   You know why I think it was so cool looking was so cool looking tech crunch ran at everybody.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.880]   The Sony Nexus X.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   521 articles.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   Total.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   I'll.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.160]   And then the guy said, Well, you know, it took me about eight hours in Photoshop.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.280]   I took a little bit from the Xperia a little bit from the put it all together and was just
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.480]   incredible, beautiful fake.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.280]   Which is, I guess the argument that Apple makes about what Samsung did.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.920]   So well, the funny thing is the funny thing is that I thought I had seen pictures of that
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.680]   thin I'm act that Apple announced yesterday.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.440]   And I thought that was a those were fake pictures and they weren't.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.440]   I thought it was somebody's photo.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.640]   She was too couldn't possibly be 5 millimeters thick.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   Right.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.440]   That can't happen.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.400]   So we're going to see now this is interesting in response to Apple.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:58.280]   We are going to see apparently a new tablet, the Nexus 10, which will be higher DPI than
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.440]   either of the new iPads.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.840]   That should be on what's beyond retina.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.240]   Super written brain brain.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   It will be 20.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.040]   This is a 10 inch tablet.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.720]   2560 by 1600.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.520]   Wow.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.400]   300 pixels per inch.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   I think that what is the iPad 265 300 pixels branch.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.960]   It's realer than reality.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:30.200]   Now something I have to say about this though is that the iPad three just recently got replaced
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   yesterday by the iPad four because the retina they're pushing so many pixels that was kind
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.360]   of sluggish compared to the previous iPads.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.440]   So Apple had to double the speed of the processor and I'm hoping Google will.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.280]   So I'm sorry for this, but because we have the iPad mini, I guess that is the iPad maxi.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:53.440]   And that was exactly why they thought they wouldn't call it the iPad mini.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.120]   But they just goes back to Jean.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.040]   Gina made this point the first day of the iPad.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.320]   They made date.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   I did.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.480]   Oh, no, you then.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.800]   All they went there.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   So I love it though.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:23.880]   It's great for consumers because they're really there's somebody I think was in our chatroom
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.040]   said this that means that this next decade, the decade of the 2010s is all going to be
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.760]   about Apple Google Apple Google.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.440]   And you saw that yesterday, right?
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.640]   You saw that with with with the next is seven.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.400]   I've never seen Apple do that.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.800]   Yeah, they have a seven on slide right there comparing head to head.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.040]   They never said Nexus seven.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.000]   They said a leading or best selling right tablet.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.560]   So so is Google going to do the same thing when they bring out the 10 inch the next is
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.240]   10, whatever it's going to be called.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   I think it'd be really interesting to have them do a point by point back at Apple.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.000]   Say look at our resolution, look how thin it is, look out whatever the, you know, whatever
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.760]   the specs are on it would be very funny if they did that because Apple didn't finally
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.640]   going to be Google's answer to the iPad.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.160]   It's getting pretty direct, isn't it?
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.960]   And it's like boom, boom.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   It's also a nexus.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.120]   So it'll run the newest version of Android, which we thought was going to be key lime
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.480]   pie, but there's just saying it's 4.2 jelly bean.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.800]   Yeah, I want to over promise.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   So what is, do you know, Gina, what that could mean or might mean?
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   The LG phone will have that that that'll only run versus what's for two versus well,
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.960]   what is for two?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   What is it going to be?
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   What's new?
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.340]   for the tablet end.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.080]   That's one thing they--
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.860]   Is it a Windows one user?
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.520]   Yeah, shared users in that you can log in as different users.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.980]   --something the people wanted from the iPad
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.840]   that they were gotten.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.340]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.360]   So, like user switching?
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.180]   Yeah, user switching, you better switch it.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.580]   Yep, yep.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.520]   OK.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.620]   By the way, Windows tablet does that interestingly.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.140]   Yeah, well, Windows has done it for forever.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.980]   Windows has always done it.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.780]   It's kind of expected.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.980]   If you had a Windows tablet or a Linux-based tablet.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.660]   You know.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.900]   This will be a Samsung, by the way, this next is 10.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.620]   The other one was made by Acer.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.820]   Or no Asus.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.020]   I can never remember the Asus.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.900]   It's one of the aces.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:07.420]   So, it's not key line pi.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.140]   It's Android 4.2 plus an updated version of Jelly Bean,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.340]   according to a version of the familiar with the announcement.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.220]   These will be the first 4.2 devices.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.140]   This is-- now, by the way, this is Google's and Android's
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.300]   downfall.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.700]   I mean, if you're going to pick the negatives,
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.660]   is that they-- that there are so many versions of Android.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.660]   And most--
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.900]   --the Apple really played on is that--
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.740]   Yes.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.100]   --we build a device that can be updated wink, wink.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.780]   Well, not all of them.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.140]   But--
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.580]   I know.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   That's true.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.140]   But still, it's a frustration that Galaxy S3 users in the UK
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.860]   only today are getting Jelly Bean.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.620]   I still don't have it on my Asus 3.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.060]   It makes me busy.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.860]   You buy the latest thing, and you don't have it.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.900]   And that's very frustrating.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.420]   I think they've got to fix that.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.620]   Or you end up with tears here.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.820]   So why are we who have this happy to have the Pure Nexus
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.300]   experience?
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.180]   Because I have Jelly Bean, the Indiana.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.980]   I don't have visual voicemail unless I go out an effort
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.220]   to go through Google Voice or whatever.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.820]   So I'm happier all at all.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.020]   But that creates a tearing that at some point
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.100]   their manufacturers are not going to be happy about.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.580]   It was not ReadRepWeb.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.820]   It was the next web that had--
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.460]   Next web, you're right.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.580]   --everything you'd ever want to know.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.420]   They also say that, as you said, there'll
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.820]   be a 3G version of the Kindle 7.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.860]   I mean, sorry, the Nexus 7 Kindle.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.500]   Nexus 7, the Nexus 7.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.020]   They're right, so the--
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.700]   The 16 is going to go down to the price of the 8.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.380]   The 8 is already out of stock.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.500]   You can't buy the 8.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.060]   So the rumors are as a 32, you were the one who revealed
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.260]   the-- by taking apart the Nexus 7 that had space for a cellular--
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.540]   Well, I saw somebody else do it, so I just opened mine.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.040]   Right.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.620]   I predict credit.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.860]   What the hell?
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.740]   Thank you for the credit.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.540]   I don't do the portage.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.700]   I'm a pundit.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.580]   So you get to the point where you have a $200 price point
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.140]   for a 16 gig for the Nexus 7.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.500]   You have $330 for 16 gig for the iPad.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.940]   And I was talking to some folks on Twitter today about this.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.620]   And it really struck me that what happens
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.540]   is that, yeah, you're buying this milk and mirrors.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:08.020]   You're buying the Hugo Boss suit instead of the JCPenney suit.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.420]   And so in a sense, Apple more and more
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.660]   becomes the designer brand in fashion terms.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.380]   And Google and Amazon both are kind of ready to wear.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.380]   That's exactly the distinction I made yesterday.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.460]   I'm back very quickly.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.220]   Really, it feels like Apple is like the bang and all of a sudden.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.180]   You can pay more, but you get a beautiful thing.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.980]   But the question is, that's a narrow niche for B&O.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.620]   Yeah, it is.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:33.820]   And it's small.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.300]   Now, Apple's done very well with that.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.180]   They're happy with it.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.420]   They love their options.
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.980]   The other thing that really hit me, Leo,
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.460]   is that I think that Nexus 7 put incredible price
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.940]   and thus profit pressure on Apple.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.860]   Because as we know, Google doesn't make money on this.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.060]   They're not in the hardware business.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.700]   The hardware is a path to what their real business is.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.260]   And it's advertising and signals and selling stuff, right?
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.700]   Where Apple does not have all those lines of business.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.220]   They have some.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:57.860]   They sell books.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.460]   They sell music.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.860]   They make that point.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.380]   But they don't really-- they've failed
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.420]   in trying to be an advertising business.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.460]   And they don't have the personal services
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.860]   that Facebook and Google have, really the same way.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.380]   So they've got to make the money on the hardware.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.220]   And that puts them into a bind.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.980]   So they've got to sell smoke.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.180]   And Apple has smoke.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.060]   They have beautiful smoke.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.740]   It smells great.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.300]   It's hickory.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.260]   It's great.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.180]   But they sell smoke.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.380]   Same as advertisers in Bogue, right?
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.660]   You're selling smoke.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.980]   Yeah, and 90%.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.100]   But Apple's completely happy with their margins
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.460]   and their niche, I guess.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.180]   But Google is also completely happy to let Apple-- to seat
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.740]   that to Apple and say, fine, we'll take a low end.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.500]   We'll take 90% to 90% users who want just to want to get
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.940]   something done.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.340]   I think that's a good division of the world.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.060]   The problem is I don't think Apple really is completely
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:49.780]   happy with their niche.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.060]   I think Apple got a taste with iOS.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.740]   They got a taste of dominance.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.180]   And I think they said, hmm.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.460]   They didn't leave with a seven inch.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.540]   They always leave and get copied, right?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.180]   The seven inch they scoffed.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.860]   I think you have to give Steve a poke that they got scoffed.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.860]   And the seven inch Google proof and Amazon both proved.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.740]   Ah, that's a good point.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.980]   Web50, whatever, said.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.380]   Because I have an unlocked Galaxy S3,
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.860]   I can get it with keys.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.780]   That's the problem.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.660]   It's the people with Verizon and AT&T,
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.780]   locked phones that won't be able to-- or whoever has it.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.700]   It's not Verizon AT&T.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.460]   No, I guess everybody has the S3.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.940]   So 4.2, content in the center, which when I read that,
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.020]   I thought, whatever that is, it doesn't sound like something
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.500]   I want.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.460]   But what it is, it's just a Play Store widget.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:45.260]   But I think it means you can access content
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.220]   from the-- like you could watch on the widget,
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.260]   you could watch a show.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.460]   Oh, OK.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.100]   Oh, oh.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.100]   Oh.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.460]   Oh.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.980]   And tablet sharing, which you mentioned.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   Multiple users.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.460]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.140]   Nobody.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.100]   I know, it's funny because Apple really has always said,
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.140]   well, we could do that.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.460]   But really, we think each of you should own one.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.700]   There's also some-- I know that there's
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.460]   some things that people have been asking around security
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.700]   for a while, like parental controls.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   So you assign your kid--
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.200]   That's nice.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.900]   You assign your kid--
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.900]   I've just done a good job with that, actually.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.820]   Yeah, so you assign your kid an account,
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.180]   and when they sign in, you've locked it down,
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.500]   or to whatever extent you can.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.260]   There are also some pictures floating out on the web
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.100]   about some work that's being done in the gallery
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.140]   to improve the look of the gallery on Android 4.2.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.620]   But I think the biggest things are really
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.460]   around security, multiple users, and things like that.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.700]   I don't think there's a lot of really
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.300]   super new, cool features that are coming out.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.180]   So I think it's a good thing that they didn't actually
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:45.740]   iterate this.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.340]   It doesn't look like the features are there.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.340]   This isn't a major iteration of Android.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.180]   It really is a minor.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.300]   No, it doesn't sound like that.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.780]   Oh, the content in the center makes a lot of sense
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.700]   because when the Nexus 7 shipped the Play Store--
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.020]   it was so Play Store-centric, the default home screen
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.620]   layout, right?
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.580]   It was like all your Play Store content,
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.660]   then that widget right there.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   So that makes sense.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.540]   But thinking about the multiple users thing,
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.540]   I'm going to really like that.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.380]   I mean, I leave the Nexus 7 laying around the living room,
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.340]   and it'd be really cool if my wife could pick it up
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.300]   and just switch to her account quickly
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.100]   to do what she needs to do so then I could switch back
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:14.940]   to my account now.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.020]   It's just kind of like--
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.020]   I agree.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.020]   I think that speaks to a different use model
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.620]   for the Nexus 7, which isn't your tablet.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.780]   It's the one you leave on the living room table.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.980]   It's like a remote control.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.820]   It's just it's a device you leave lying around.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820]   I use it.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.420]   I use only the Nexus 7 now to record on our DVR.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.020]   No.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.100]   The Verizon app, right?
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.260]   Now, the truth is I do take this with me everywhere,
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.380]   whereas Leo, you never take your tablet with you.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.860]   Only because it's Wi-Fi and I want 3G.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.780]   But I have practically have that with the Note 2.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.380]   That's true, Joe.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   It's so big.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.540]   I got meaning to ask Leo.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.020]   You probably every phone, you do everything.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.540]   All right?
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.660]   I'm now putting you on Desert Island.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.020]   You're allowed to have one phone with you,
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.420]   either the Note or the S3.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.100]   Which one do you take?
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.020]   Well, see, the Desert Island's the mistake,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   because that changes the use.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.420]   But so don't say Desert Island.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.900]   Just say in your normal life.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.380]   OK.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.420]   Because if you're Desert Island, I
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.700]   would absolutely take the Note 2,
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.500]   because this would be--
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:10.900]   Because it's bigger.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.580]   It could do all of that, right?
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.700]   But carry it around.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.140]   It's funny.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.380]   I switched to the S3 again for a couple of days,
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.660]   last couple of days, because I have multiple batteries.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.580]   I have a case.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.300]   I don't have a case yet for the Note 2.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.180]   I have a dashboard mount.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.820]   So they're for pure convenience.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.300]   And I had to note that it's the same resolution as the Note 2.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.780]   They're both 1280 by 720.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.900]   So it's not like I'm getting anything more.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.620]   It's just smaller or bigger.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.260]   So I think they're both very good.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.460]   And I think it's more-- that's really mostly just
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.940]   a personal choice.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.020]   Now, what about the same phone, basically?
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.460]   Although I love-- OK, I'll take it back,
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.460]   because I love Jelly Bean.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.220]   And Jelly Bean is significantly better.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:53.020]   So because my S3 didn't have Jelly Bean, or will tonight,
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.420]   that might be another thing.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:54.900]   I love--
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.780]   Even Google Now is so cool.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.340]   It has potential.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.740]   It's cool now to work well for me.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.300]   It keeps telling me to update my thing.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.060]   I update my thing.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:02.820]   It doesn't tell me much.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.740]   It's the weather.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.980]   Well, if you haven't had a date thing,
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.540]   you don't deserve Google Now.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.060]   I--
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.980]   I don't know what that means.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.100]   So it's showing me my next show, "Triangulation."
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.060]   It shows me the-- and I love seeing this again and again.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.340]   This is one flaw.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.460]   I've been seeing the same giant's cardinal score
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.860]   for a couple of days now.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.500]   But it's a good score, so I don't mind.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.180]   It's showing me the weather in Petaluma.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:26.500]   See?
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.060]   It knows.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.420]   And then it will do interesting things like, say,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.620]   this morning, for instance, I drive my son to school
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.220]   every morning, it knew that.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.140]   And it said, your commute time to Sonoma.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.580]   It had to do that for me.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.740]   That's amazing.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.780]   Yeah, that's what I've got traffic still.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.180]   I still have two identities to Google, which--
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.940]   all right, I have my apps identity and my Gmail identity.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.620]   And I do different things in each.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.180]   So I'm stuck with my Gmail identity on Google Plus,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.180]   because they couldn't do apps.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.140]   My really mails on apps.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.780]   And it's because when I do get my Chromebook,
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.260]   I don't know, Gina, any advice?
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:03.140]   Which of my identities should I sign into for the browser
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.260]   when my browser becomes my OS?
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.900]   Yeah, I mean, what do you-- which profile
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.980]   do you sign into Chrome with?
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.620]   Do you sync your bookmarks and stuff with Chrome?
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.500]   I have signed in with my Gmail account,
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.540]   because that's what was available.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.100]   But now that I have the chance to change,
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.500]   I should change it to my apps.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.940]   I don't know what you should do.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.260]   Yeah, I mean, honestly, I usually just use my Gmail account,
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.780]   because the Gmail accounts just tend to get things faster.
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.340]   You get to opt into experiments that aren't available to apps.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.740]   So yeah, I would just use a vanilla Gmail account, which
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.180]   is a bummer.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.220]   I know I have the same problem.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.420]   Which between my apps and the Gmail account--
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.580]   I thought they fixed that for you.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.820]   No, I'm thinking.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:43.580]   You can move your Google+ over, but you lose a lot in the way.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:45.460]   Lose all your followers, and yeah,
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.780]   you have to reset up the whole thing.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.540]   And people have to re-circle you.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.780]   And yeah, I just stick with my Gmail account for that reason.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.020]   Where do I want the 100 megs of free Google browser?
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:55.900]   Well, that's a point, right?
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.220]   Because you only get it in one place, right?
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.780]   By the way, I want to get an update here.
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.540]   I went to 12th force, saying, what's
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.500]   the deal on your deliveries?
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.420]   People all over Google+ are getting it.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.540]   Sean answering on 12th force.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.340]   What's 12th force?
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.060]   That's the Twitter help force for Best Buy.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:11.900]   OK.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.580]   So they looked into the order, and they found--
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.940]   and Douglas and Sean, both at Best Buy, had tipped you.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.220]   This is something that Best Buy still does really well.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.300]   And I'm in the speech of tomorrow.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.260]   All right.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:23.900]   Good deal.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.700]   12th force to the rescue.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.380]   You bet.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.460]   That's what they do.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.140]   3,000 people on one Twitter account,
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.700]   you got a problem with Best Buy, go to them.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   It works every time for me.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.780]   Are we talking to one of the best buy-ups next week?
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.860]   Robert Stevens, who was the founder of Geek Squad,
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.180]   and was the CTO of Best Buy.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.660]   He quit about nine months ago before there
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.540]   was a lot of other turmoil, too.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.780]   He's a great not-spoken guy.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.460]   He's on the show.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.980]   Chad, next week, right?
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.820]   In-person.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.020]   In-studio-person.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:50.580]   Oh, great.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:51.660]   Cool.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.780]   I have some computers I'd like to give him to fix.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.020]   Do we have a Chromebook around?
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.020]   Could he fix that?
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.340]   But that's another issue is repairability of the Chromebook.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.420]   I guess at that price, you just throw it out and buy another one.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.900]   You throw it in the pond like the commercial says.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.980]   It's a disposable computer, essentially.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.820]   It's a disposable computer.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.860]   You can stomp on it.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   You don't lose anything.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.060]   Almost-- I mean, there's a lot fewer parts to go bad.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.580]   You go bad, right?
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.700]   Most everything's built in.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.580]   They never break.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.900]   No, it's only going to drive at all.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.620]   Who fixes it if they break?
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.860]   Best Buy-'ll-fix yours, Jeff, but if you bought it from Play.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.500]   If it's broken, it's still in warranty,
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.900]   you just send it back to you.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.300]   You send it.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.460]   Yeah, they send you a new one.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.620]   Oh, you're still in the cloud anyway.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.580]   All right.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.300]   Newegg was selling it with trying
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.100]   to get you to buy up the $50 data backup plan.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.100]   [GASPS]
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.620]   Oh.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.580]   Good luck, Newegg.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.660]   So now I want one.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.780]   I'm going to buy one.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.300]   Maybe I should do a week of just using one.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:45.940]   Wow.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.220]   We've shamed him into it.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:47.860]   OK.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.180]   Of course, maybe I need a writing computer.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:51.460]   I don't know.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.300]   I've been--
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.140]   I need so.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.500]   This is actually Leo's doing it for comedy material.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:02.260]   [SQUEAKING]
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.780]   Let's-- oh, I know one more thing.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.980]   You don't have a don?
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.020]   What?
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.180]   James Bond uses an Android phone.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180]   James Bond.
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:09.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.580]   We have to change the log, yeah.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.580]   Change the log.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   Oh, the change log.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.980]   Don't be no close.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.660]   You want to do it?
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.060]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:18.740]   Do it.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.460]   The change log.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.460]   The Google change log.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.060]   It says-- say it again.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.900]   Yes, each and every week.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.620]   Gina Trapani will tell you things
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.780]   that are new with the Google.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.300]   And now Gina Trapani.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.780]   New in the Googleverse.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.900]   Starting today, documents, spreadsheets,
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.100]   and presentations in Google Drive
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.300]   are now called Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.580]   And there are apps for them in the Chrome Web Store.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.820]   So actually, if you just go follow Google Drive,
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.300]   plus Google Drive and Google+, you
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.940]   can get links to all the apps.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.380]   All they do is add shortcuts in a new tab in Chrome
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:56.900]   to get write to Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.300]   and other Google Drive apps.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.140]   So instead of just that one Google Drive Chrome app,
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.860]   you've got individual ones.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.900]   Google Calendar for Android just became available in the Play
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.400]   Store.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.300]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.540]   I mean, Google Calendar is generally
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.940]   shipped on Google branded phones.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.740]   And it comes kind of built in.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:14.980]   Now it's available in the Play Store.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.060]   So if you have a Jelly Bean or ICS installed on any handset,
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.420]   you can install Google Calendar from the Play Store.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.460]   Although, be warned, there are some known issues
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.420]   with HEC handsets.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.700]   The week and the day view doesn't quite work.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.100]   Google lists those known issues on the Play Store
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:29.980]   listing, actually.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.420]   So this is kind of interesting.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.180]   I wonder if Google's ever going to release, say, the Gmail
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.580]   app to the Play Store.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.460]   And I wonder if this means that someday we'll
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.220]   see these kind of stock Google apps that we all love so much
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.460]   show up in places like the Amazon App Store.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.220]   I don't know.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.780]   But interesting to see them unbundle it
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.500]   and make it available on the Play Store.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.860]   Gee, I don't understand.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:54.060]   Doesn't the Gmail app get sent with every Android phone?
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:54.540]   But no.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.140]   The Gmail does, but not G Calendar.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:01.020]   So right now, it's not in the Google version of Android.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.900]   So it's not in the Android open source project.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.220]   So that's why you don't get it on these other stuff.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.460]   Oh, interesting.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.100]   Google version of Android that ships with Google services.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.540]   So the Play Store itself comes--
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.700]   the Gmail comes and get Calendar
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.380]   used to be one of these built in apps.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.340]   Now Calendar is available in the Play Store.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.260]   So they've kind of unbundled it and said,
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.660]   if you buy a phone that's not a Google experience phone,
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.740]   and you have access to the Play Store, you can download Calendar.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.420]   Or if you're not in the open handset alliance,
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.060]   because you're making a clone of Android,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.900]   you can just download all the tools.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.220]   And it'll be just as good.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:33.740]   Right.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.240]   Got it.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.260]   I wonder if that's really what Google wants to do.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.060]   Yeah, I wonder.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.980]   I wonder if it would be interesting to see if they start
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.300]   offering all those bundled apps.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:40.820]   Like the Gmail--
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.980]   Or users the better--
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.500]   I can't.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.300]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.580]   The Calendar's fairly sparse.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.300]   It's not a great-- I mean, there's other-- in fact,
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.620]   maybe for my tool, I'll show you my favorite calendar.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.460]   I'd love to--
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.620]   I like the calendar.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.460]   It's OK.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.940]   It's a new icon, too, with this change.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.660]   It's got--
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.260]   Yeah, it's got a little turning little corner going up.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.260]   Right, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.780]   Google adds 25 million new building footprints
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.220]   to Google Maps on desktop and mobile.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.660]   Building footprints are just not when you're in satellite mode
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.300]   when you're just sort of in plain drawing mode
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:08.860]   and Google Maps.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.940]   You can see the footprints of buildings.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.460]   The areas that got the update are major cities, US cities,
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.820]   like Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.460]   The company uses aerial imagery and computer vision techniques
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.220]   to determine the shapes and sizes of the buildings.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.340]   Some neat little updates to Google Maps there.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.780]   Google News gets a little bit of a redesign.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.500]   Click to expand clusters.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   So when you search Google News and you get a bunch of links,
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.460]   they kind of cluster together and you can expand them.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.020]   And there's a new sidebars of photos and videos.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.940]   It's kind of like TechMeemish layout.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.580]   And finally, Google Books' N-gram viewer--
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.900]   this is a cool, cool product.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.420]   They take all the books that they scan in Google Books.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.940]   Then N-gram viewer lets you type in a couple of keywords
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.780]   and see the frequency of use of those words over time.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.940]   That got a huge, a big data set update.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.460]   It's got a much larger data set.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.100]   And it understands parts of speech.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.860]   So if you use a word as a noun versus a verb,
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.380]   you can get results on that.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:12.540]   N-gram viewers is kind of really nerdy, obscure tool
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.300]   for people who really love data.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.620]   It only gets used like 50 times a minute, which
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.820]   is a lot, I guess, to the whole world, but not really to Google.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.740]   It's really cool, though.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.700]   If you check out N-gram viewer, you
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:25.660]   can look at the instances of certain-- the way
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.260]   that certain words are used over time.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.060]   And with this bigger data set, it's got smarter results.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.100]   It's pretty cool.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.100]   I think we talked about it when it first came out.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.420]   We demoed it, played with it.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.420]   Yep, we did.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.020]   That's all I got.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.180]   That's the changetlog to an image week to find out
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.420]   what's new with the Goog.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.740]   Thank you, Gina, for panning.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.660]   We have an open and the close.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.220]   I think we need a little check.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.100]   Oh, I know what we need.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.180]   If somebody wants to work on something,
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.100]   like we could count a bullet for each one.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:58.980]   Like--
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.420]   We're going to move the hell out of this thing.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.060]   It will soon have its own YouTube channel.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.940]   The changetlog.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.380]   So James Bond uses an Android phone.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.100]   I was always wondering, is James Bond-- he's a shaken, not
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.220]   stirred.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.660]   Is he an iPhone, not Android?
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.140]   But remember that Sony-- in fact, you've already seen
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:26.740]   Sony ads featuring Daniel Craig, which I just find kind of weird.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.540]   Like-- but anyway, but Sony makes the movie right.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.020]   So it's going to be Vio's all throughout.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:38.420]   And apparently, in Skyfall, James Bond uses an Android phone.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:42.300]   It's an Xperia T, which is, of course, Sony.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.060]   And you'll be able to win one.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.660]   There's some sort of contest.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.060]   But somebody uses it.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.500]   Did you guys see the Coke commercial, by the way, for Skyfall?
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.460]   No.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.620]   Well, off topic, but it's hilarious.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.340]   If you search for the Coke commercial for Skyfall,
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:56.980]   it's pretty funny.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:59.300]   They set these people up.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.460]   They went to a vending machine, and they said, oh, if you go
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.300]   do this--
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   Oh, it's a Coke Zero.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.500]   Yeah, it's a Coke Zero thing.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.100]   And they had people playing the music,
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.780]   so they made them run through the mall or something.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.340]   And as they were running, there was people actually
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.780]   playing instruments, playing the music.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.900]   Unlock the double of seven in you.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.340]   So what is this at some British train station?
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.540]   I don't know exactly where it is.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.500]   Some guys--
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.820]   Gal's playing the violin, guys swooping the floor.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.900]   There's a bunch of oranges.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.340]   And then he goes to a Coke machine,
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.980]   and it says, want the chance to-- well, by the way,
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.660]   he gets out of the way cleverly.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.700]   And she starts playing the Bond theme.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.820]   Says you want to--
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.620]   So it's giving-- the machine's like talking to you.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.980]   Enter your name, David.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:37.780]   Go to platform six.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.820]   You have 70 seconds to unlock the double of seven in you.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.940]   69, 68.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.860]   She's playing the song.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.700]   Sounds easy.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.740]   That's why we made it harder.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.020]   Oh, this is so funny.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.740]   So the guy mopping turns out to be in the way.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.660]   Right.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.940]   As well as a bunch of other things.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.020]   And then there's now some vocal ease.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.060]   Oh my god, Anthony.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060]   Oh my god, Mike.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.220]   How are you?
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.380]   Martha, don't you remember?
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.580]   A beautiful woman in a red dress costing him.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.060]   Some joggers going the wrong way on the escalator.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.980]   There's people's are standing there holding little boards
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.700]   at all the time.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.620]   How much time do you have left?
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.420]   A lot of dogs.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.820]   This is really-- do you think they really did this?
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.780]   Or is this staged?
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.380]   It'd be really good if they actually did it.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.180]   Big plate of glass.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.460]   Oh, and of course--
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.820]   I'm hoping to see someone go through there.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.220]   The oranges spill.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.020]   He falls on him.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.340]   This is hysterical.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:33.260]   39, she's got an iPad or an X is 7 with the time.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.300]   Does somebody have a tablet?
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.420]   No, I don't think so he does.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.700]   He gets the luggage falls over the organ grinder.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.620]   Wow, this is quite elaborate.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.540]   This is kind of like-- oh, and he gets to like a Zoltan.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.940]   Sing the bond tune to get exclusive tickets.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.660]   It's not too hard they've been playing it the whole--
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.220]   Right.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.300]   If you don't know it by now, you're in big trouble.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.380]   And then they're the audience.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.580]   That's pretty cute.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:04.260]   It's kind of a new kind of flash mob.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.500]   And so he gets some tickets.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.460]   All he gets is tickets to a movie for all of that.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.940]   A lot of when companies get creative though,
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.020]   I mean, you notice you didn't really-- at least I didn't
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.180]   notice Coke wasn't in every scene.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.580]   It wasn't like, oh, I love Coke.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.260]   It's a treat.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.620]   I thought it was an ad for Skyfall.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.260]   I mean, they teamed up and they did something creative.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.100]   They get spread around the web, virally, and I don't know.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.620]   Well done.
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.740]   Now I'm going to do a boring--
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.020]   I love-- you know what I love about this show that I play ads.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:30.820]   And then I do an ad.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.420]   Perfect timing.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.300]   And then you enjoy it all, I hope.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.660]   I hope, I hope, I hope.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.860]   We're talking about the Goog.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.100]   There's lots more to talk about.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.820]   Holy cow.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.660]   In fact, I'm going to ask during the break if you guys just
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.660]   pick a few-- because we're running out of time.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.100]   We've spent a long time talking about a few things.
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.500]   So each of you pick a few stories
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.740]   that you think are important.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.660]   Google Wallet sued for patent infringement,
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:05.020]   news.me dumping Twitter or vice versa, I guess, dumping iOS,
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.580]   Zynga, firing a bunch of people during the Apple
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.780]   announcement yesterday so no one would notice.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:14.940]   And Minnesota will allow online courses after all.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.580]   That was just a weird story.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.060]   Before we do all of that, though,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.940]   let's talk about where your money is.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:22.700]   Now, normally I wouldn't get this personal with you.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   But I have to ask.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.660]   Are you maximizing your online savings?
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:35.140]   The American Express Bank FSB has high interest savings account,
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.540]   high yield savings account, waiting for you.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.620]   It's a great way to get the maximum savings.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.140]   Now, it doesn't mean you're going to dump your bank by any means.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.100]   This is just another tool in reaching your life goals,
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.900]   whether it's a home or a car that you're saving for,
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.980]   saving funds for an unexpected emergency.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.100]   We all need some savings.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.140]   We all get a bit disciplined about putting away a portion
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.020]   of what we earn.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.540]   And if you visit personalsavings.com/onlinesavings,
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.620]   you can see the very high yield savings account offered
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.100]   to you by American Express right now.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.820]   It's a great complement to your existing financial tools.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.340]   Transfer money easily in and out, which is nice,
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.580]   depending on your needs.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.420]   Keep track of your balance via your phone or web 24/7.

[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.740]   so it is, again, not a replacement, but just a complement
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.300]   to your overall financial planning.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:32.180]   Personalsavings.com/onlinesavings.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.660]   Take control of your finances right now
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.500]   with American Express Personal Savings.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.860]   Remember FDIC.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.300]   We thank American Express Bank FSB for their support of this week.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.900]   Google, it's nice to have them on board.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.060]   I have been American Express card holder since 1981.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.340]   72, I think, here, Leo.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.980]   72.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.060]   You must have got it right out of college.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.780]   I was 25 when I got mine.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.540]   It's got effect.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.140]   It could be 72.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.860]   It could be 72.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.660]   No, it had to be 72.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.980]   How old are you?
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.460]   Well, I graduated early.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.500]   Ah, you're a young man with a vision of the future.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.620]   They're involved in Chromebooks, apparently.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.220]   Little did you know that 30 years later, 38 years later,
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.260]   you'd be owning a $250 computer.
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.740]   What powerful is the mainframe?
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.700]   All right, Gina, what did you pick as your next story?
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.060]   I'm letting you do the work.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:33.700]   I want to talk about this Amazon wiping this person's Kindle.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   Did you guys hear about this?
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.980]   Yeah, we actually talked about it on security now.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.860]   It's very-- I'm really glad you brought up.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   Actually, Jeff tweeted it.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.180]   That's how I found out about it.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.460]   Yeah, I mean, and it was the same day.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.740]   This story broke also the same day at the EC2 outage.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.500]   I saw a lot of tweets about how the promise of the cloud
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.220]   is that the cloud is dead, the cloud doesn't work,
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.780]   this is the dangers of the cloud, and the EC2 outage
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.420]   and the Kindle deletion, what were two kind of very separate
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:58.780]   issues.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.540]   They just happened in both the Amazon.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.940]   So it's interesting.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.380]   I mean, should we be telling our family members
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.740]   to not buy Kindle books?
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.780]   Because Amazon could just remotely wipe your device
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.180]   if they decide that your account doesn't look good to them.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.100]   I don't know if that's the solution.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:19.300]   Should we expect people to back up their Kindle books?
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:24.180]   Let me give you the background, folks, so you can decide this.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.100]   And I think it was-- the truth is we don't know--
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.260]   it could be apocryphal.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.740]   I should say this right up front.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:33.340]   Because we don't know the actual person to whom this happens.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.740]   Supposedly, her name is Lynn.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.780]   She's Norwegian.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.660]   She had a Kindle.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.540]   And we learned about it.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.780]   Actually, it's Lynn Nygaard.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.780]   We do now know her name.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.300]   She's an IT consultant living in Norway.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.660]   And there was a blog post by another person
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.860]   describing what happened to her.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.100]   But unfortunately, it's in Norwegian.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.540]   But apparently what happened was that Amazon
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.300]   had identified her account in the UK
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.940]   as being associated with a previously banned account
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.740]   for banned for reasons they wouldn't say.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.260]   And not only discontinued her account,
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.900]   but were told wiped her Kindle.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.020]   Now, I've heard later stories that her Kindle was broken,
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.980]   but because she didn't have an account,
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.940]   she couldn't then use Kindle on anything--
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.740]   or Kindle app on anything else and get the books back.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.940]   For whatever reason, all the books that she had previously
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.420]   thought she owned were gone.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.980]   And her attempts to get Amazon to explain or return it
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.860]   were not handled very well.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.460]   Amazon said, we can't tell you.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.540]   We won't tell you.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.220]   But that's just how it is.
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.780]   It was something to do with an account you're associated with.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.900]   And we won't tell you who or why.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.900]   Then there was a follow up that said
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.620]   that her access to the books she'd already bought
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.980]   was restored.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.460]   Not that they needed to.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.380]   And this is the point.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.740]   And it's probably important to read the license.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:01.340]   Kindle content is licensed, not sold to you by the content
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.340]   provider.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.620]   It's licensed.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.620]   It's not sold.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.140]   Not sold.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.900]   Your rights under this agreement will automatically
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   terminate if you fail to comply with the terms
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.340]   of this agreement, in case of such termination,
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:16.460]   you must cease all use of the Kindle Store and the Kindle
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.380]   content.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.460]   And Amazon may immediately revoke your access
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.300]   to the Kindle Store and the Kindle content--
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.740]   in other words, your books.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.460]   As you said, Leo, I find my fees.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.540]   When is a book not a book?
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.780]   And so my kind of attitude towards this
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.180]   is that we just assume that a Kindle book is the same as that
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.020]   book on my shelf.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:33.860]   It's not.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.460]   It's not.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.020]   It's more like music.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.260]   Yeah, it's like iTunes music.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.740]   And it's good to know Amazon not only can kill your account,
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.500]   but can reach into your Kindle and erase everything that's on it.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.900]   It's not quite like iTunes music, right?
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.700]   Because you download that and you store it,
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.060]   and it doesn't necessarily have DRM on it, right?
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.060]   Those are files that are on your computer.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:53.660]   Right.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.060]   Now it doesn't anymore have DRM.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.220]   Right, doesn't anymore have it.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.820]   It did at some point, right?
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:03.780]   So yeah, you still download it, and you could download it.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.180]   I mean, if I look at my Android phone,
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.340]   I could see the files, the Moby files that are downloaded.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.020]   So you are downloading content.
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.220]   And you could back it up and store it somewhere.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.980]   But without a Kindle account, active Kindle account,
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.700]   you couldn't read it.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.100]   You'd have to strip the DRM out for it.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.420]   You have to strip the DRM off, right?
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.420]   Right.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.860]   And which would be illegal, by the way.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.740]   You've already agreed.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.540]   I don't own this book.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.220]   I'm just licensing it.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.020]   Right.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.500]   So my mother-in-law voracious reader,
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.260]   we got our Kindle.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.220]   She absolutely loves it.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.740]   And for someone like her, she's never going to strip the DRM.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.020]   She's never going to back up.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.660]   And if something like this happened to her,
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.860]   she would lose a lot of content.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.260]   And I think it's important to--
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.980]   I think that that leasing versus buying
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.620]   is a very important distinction.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.540]   And for me, it's like, OK, this is for throwaway books.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.060]   This is for books I'm going to read once.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.540]   And then I don't care.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.620]   I might lose.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.620]   Although I take a lot of notes on my Kindle as well.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.980]   I highlight a lot of stuff from books.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.820]   So this story, really.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:57.860]   Well, we heard this before.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.220]   It's not the first time we've heard it.
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.260]   Remember the 1984 case where somebody
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.580]   had a copy of 1984 that they had heavily annotated it?
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.420]   Amazon deleted the--
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.260]   it was turned out to be an illicit copy.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:08.860]   I can't remember.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.420]   For some reason, but Amazon deleted it.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.340]   And then all their notes, and they never
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.940]   did recover all their notes.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.420]   Right.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.420]   So that's not--
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.260]   This is a matter of principle, right?
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.580]   Do you-- it's the same problem.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.460]   After all this fight about copyright,
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.300]   at least let us buy something and actually own it.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.900]   And that's the essence of copyright,
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.820]   is that you get some right to it that's been taken away too.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.060]   Well, I agree and that should change.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.980]   But I should also-- I would also say that everybody
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.380]   should understand that when you're not buying a book.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.020]   And so don't be surprised if it doesn't continue.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.460]   And we've talked about this a couple of months ago
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.940]   where what happens is if you die.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.620]   If you have a library of books, give it to your heirs,
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.420]   you can't give your iTunes music or your Amazon books
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.140]   to your heirs.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.860]   It's not yours to give.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.340]   Or Henry Blodgett today too was saying that I was doing my Nexus
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.700]   7 horing, pushing it was people going bananas
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.900]   about the new iPad.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.660]   And Henry said, but I've got my family
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.060]   has all these books and all these movies and things
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.140]   on Apple.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.700]   And basically it becomes the business model like airlines
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.780]   and cable companies.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.700]   You're prisoned.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.540]   Lock in.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.260]   That's your content.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.380]   You don't want to lose your content.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.340]   So I don't know whether this case is real or not.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.340]   It looked pretty real.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.180]   The email's back and forth.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:25.860]   I did email Amazon personally and asked them for response.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.180]   I got none.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.820]   One of the sites in Skadyn, maybe that reported this,
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.540]   said they got response and put that up.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.220]   But I don't know because I never got to Amazon.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.300]   So I'm not going to fully judge.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.100]   I wish they'd respond to me and they haven't done that.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.460]   I said I was on the show.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.980]   But I think it's one of those cases where--
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.060]   I hate to say it this way, but true or not,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.140]   it is a reminder of what we're buying into.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.820]   Right.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.220]   And the average user is not going to know that.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:52.780]   Right.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.500]   I mean, to your point, Leo, the average user
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.460]   is not going to know that it's just like with music.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.140]   I mean, people get in trouble with music.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.580]   It's like you have a license to listen to the music.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.020]   You do not own the music, obviously.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.900]   Same thing here with books.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.820]   And I think it's going to trip a lot of average users up,
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.500]   eventually.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.620]   Amazon certainly-- I encourage them to contact us.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.460]   You could contact chat@twit.tv or me, Leo@leoeville.com.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.380]   And we'll put you on.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.620]   But I'll channel them.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.180]   Didn't you read the Terms of Service?
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.020]   It said very clearly you don't own that book.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.340]   And then we could erase it.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.300]   Why would you ever think you owned that book?
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.620]   And it's just a confusion between the old 20th century
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.420]   way of disseminating information in the modern 21st century
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:34.980]   way.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.660]   You got the convenience of the Kindle.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.780]   It's the ease of use.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.420]   You can-- the portability.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.340]   But in return, you don't actually own a book.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.460]   I mean, if you've ever moved and you have thousands of books,
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.780]   you know that that's an-- that's an own nurse burden.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.340]   We've eliminated that burden for you.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.060]   But the real issue here--
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.620]   I think it's somewhat of a main real issue here.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.740]   One is lawyers in terms of service, obviously.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.700]   And I was at a good session yesterday
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:03.180]   at the Ford Foundation about helping media.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.700]   And Andrew Roushe was there from New York
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.660]   talking about the effort to make sites
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.660]   link to plain language crowdsourced versions
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.300]   of their Terms of Service.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.220]   Before you sign into a TOS, say, what are you agreeing to?
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.540]   And I'll link there and go off to some place where it's
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.340]   been reworded in short English.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.140]   Yes.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.100]   I do have to say that I'm now looking at Amazon
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.740]   and 50 Shades of Grey.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:29.380]   And it does say, buy now, right?
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.940]   I mean, it's saying, well, wait a minute now,
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.420]   let's look in the Kindle.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.100]   So that's for the book.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.580]   All of the wording is that you are--
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.180]   Buy now with one click.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.900]   So I'm buying--
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.980]   Oh, it looks like I already bought it.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.540]   Never mind.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.820]   I don't have--
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.420]   License this content now.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.220]   Yeah, I should say--
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.620]   So I would say there is a burden on Amazon.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.740]   And at some point, somebody's going
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:55.060]   to have to tell Amazon to do this to change your language.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.100]   I'm sorry, I'm very clear.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.580]   You're not buying this.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.820]   You're renting it.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.220]   The Owen leather out of my head now.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.820]   Causing it back.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.100]   I thought it was an instruction manual.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.220]   What I didn't know.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.500]   Friends of mine were the Kindle went out and actually bought
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.620]   the hard copy of that book with cash,
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.180]   because they didn't want anybody to have a record
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.180]   that they had bought that book.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:18.020]   Well, I just announced to the world that I only--
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.540]   Well, actually, Gene, the argument is--
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.980]   I only rented it.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.700]   It sold so well, it's because people
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.580]   could hide the fact they're reading it in a Kindle.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.900]   Right, on the Kindle.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.380]   This story, not only is it the issue of leasing versus buying,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.500]   but if you read through the customer service emails,
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.140]   Amazon was basically saying your account was associated
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.380]   with another account that broke our policies.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.620]   This woman asks what account and what--
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.700]   They wouldn't tell her.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.260]   And they wouldn't tell her.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.140]   And I feel like that's just a reasonable expectation
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.260]   to say, if you're going to shut down my account,
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.020]   you have to give me something.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.020]   You've got to give me stuff.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:50.700]   I can't.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.980]   But there may be legal reasons they couldn't tell her,
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.020]   for instance.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.620]   So sometimes-- OK, I'll give you an example.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.020]   And I don't know if this is a German or not.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.620]   But if somebody calls me and asks me why the play was terminated,
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.100]   I can't say, well, he was the biggest schmuck ever.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.980]   I have to say, I can't say anything about that.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.660]   I can merely say he used to work here,
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.420]   and he no longer works here.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.460]   Because of liability to you.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.820]   For liability reasons.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.940]   And so I suspect that the lawyers at Amazon--
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.900]   Amazon's not trying to obfuscate,
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.900]   but they've been told, you can't talk about this issue.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.900]   I can't.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.140]   But let's-- I'll still go to-- Jean is trying to do the right thing,
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.140]   which is to go up with the principle of rights here.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.380]   The principle should be that you have a right of appeal.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.900]   If you're being accused of having something wrong doing,
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.620]   and you have real material loss to this,
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.620]   same as if I've argued with Google that when you get shut out
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:36.980]   as presumed to be a bad advertiser,
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.220]   I've said that they ought to have a jury appears to judge this.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.180]   There should be some mechanism of appeal.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.460]   That's expensive, I know.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.660]   But it's exactly the same Leo with every time
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.780]   you get knocked off YouTube.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.780]   They should.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.180]   However, I just have to point out they're very clear
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.700]   in their terms of service and their license.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.300]   They're not doing anything that they are not absolutely
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.300]   entitled to do.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.540]   And they don't say we have to explain it.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.900]   In fact, I think they explicitly said we don't have to explain it.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:01.900]   Yeah, I know.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.620]   Well, which is where the FTC--
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.820]   John Lewis, the head of the FTC, was at this thing yesterday.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.540]   And that's the point made.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.100]   When Verizon comes along and said recently,
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.860]   when you're one of our customers on the phone,
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.940]   we are going to watch your browser history.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.660]   We're going to do this.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.540]   We're going to do that.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.940]   And we're going to sell it to people.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.300]   And yeah, you can opt out if you go through about 87 steps,
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.900]   hoops of fire and glass.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.340]   But as long as they told you they're going to do it,
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.620]   then as noxious as it might be, there's absolutely no liability
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.580]   then.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.460]   The problem is it's hidden in a TOS.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.540]   So I think what we-- again, if this case is real or not,
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.900]   it forces a discussion about terms of services again.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.460]   And we've got to figure out a better way
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.940]   to deal with making that public.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.860]   Corey Doctorow does talk a little bit about what
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.620]   it speculates a little bit about what's going on.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:48.300]   It has to do with-- in English language book contracts,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.420]   it's almost always the case.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.860]   Countries where English isn't the native or official language
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.220]   are, quote, "open territory."
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.500]   That means if a writer sells her English language rights
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.980]   in Canada and the US to Macmillan, the UK to Penguin,
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.620]   both Penguin and Macmillan are legally allowed to sell competing
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.700]   versions to Norway.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.260]   However, the universal approach taken by ebook retailers
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.540]   is to pretend that open territory doesn't exist.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.020]   If no publisher is registered as the exclusive provider
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.740]   in an area, the retailers refuse
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.540]   to sell to people in those countries.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.260]   So it may very well be that Amazon said,
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.140]   you're in Norway, you bought the English version,
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.620]   you can't do that.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.900]   And just to raise it.
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.300]   That sounds like something they might do.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.220]   I don't know.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.580]   It's anyway, there's all sorts of reasons they might do it.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.820]   There's even reasons why they may not be able to or may not
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.380]   want to be willing to explain it.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:44.380]   And so people, I think it's certainly behooves them
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.820]   just morally and ethically to be very clear.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.060]   And maybe there should be a pop-up saying,
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.620]   hey, by the way, you're not buying this book,
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.460]   you're just renting it.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.980]   And if we decide to terminate your rights, it's gone.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.060]   Or at least the first time you buy a book, right?
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.060]   I mean, the first time-- Maybe they do.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:57.860]   I mean, they say they do.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.060]   They have it in terms of service.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.140]   Don't you read that?
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:00.820]   Yeah, amazingly.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.260]   Come on.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.180]   I love the South Park episode where the Apple terms of service
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.540]   allowed us to enslave you.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.900]   And didn't you read the terms of service?
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.580]   I read the terms of service.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.180]   It was a very good send-up.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.020]   It was kind of foul.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.220]   That was a very good send-up.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.460]   OK, good choice.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.660]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.140]   Sure.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.580]   Jeff Jarvis, what's your story?
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   All right, I've got to go to my European friends.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   And it's not the fact that Google and Nokia and other companies
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   entered into an agreement to start a service
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.420]   so that you can blur your house on maps.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.540]   I won't go to that.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.860]   I won't do that.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.380]   Won't do it.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.060]   And would just be too obvious.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:37.820]   Yeah, it would be.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.380]   But now that there are publishers in Germany and France
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:44.580]   and Brazil all threatening to pull their stuff from Google
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.740]   and try to get laws passed to charge them,
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.540]   Google finally is fighting back.
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.180]   And in France, they set a letter to a bunch of government
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.540]   ministers saying that this would be deadly.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.220]   It would kill them.
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.820]   And basically threatening.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.420]   If they're told they have to pay for the links,
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.620]   they'll just stop linking to publishers.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:04.300]   And they send 4 billion links to media in France alone in a month.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.340]   And nah.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.420]   And I think it's high time for Google to fight back.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.220]   Yes.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:12.060]   Turn it cutting off your nose to spite your face.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.580]   Shh.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.620]   You're going nice.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.940]   Gallic knows it is.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.340]   Oh, it's easier to cut off that way.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:19.940]   I like this.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.260]   We might do the whole show this way.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.980]   You just pick a story, pick a story, pick a story.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.340]   This is a good way to do it.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:28.260]   Why should I do any work?
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:30.180]   Aaron, Aaron, did you pick a story?
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.060]   I did, actually.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.460]   And this is about Google Maps.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.460]   So Google Maps has started--
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.820]   I think they actually previewed this at Google I/O.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.460]   They're walking cameras that they backpack cameras.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:42.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.420]   And they can walk around trails and things like that,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.700]   where you wouldn't normally obviously get a car or the tricycle.
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.020]   And so right now they're doing the Grand Canyon,
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.020]   which I thought was really cool.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.460]   So they're starting with the Grand Canyon.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.260]   It makes sense.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.500]   And they're going to be walking around with these cameras
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.860]   and doing basically Google Maps for trails.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.940]   And if you haven't seen these things, they're really interesting.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:07.380]   They've got the soccer ball camera looking thing on the back.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.940]   And it's painted Google colors.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.820]   Yeah, of course.
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.140]   And it's the nice Android green there.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.900]   They don't buy one if you could.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:15.900]   I would.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:16.740]   Are you kidding?
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.780]   I'd love to walk around with them.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.980]   They say they're 40 pounds.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.940]   They weigh about 40 pounds.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.660]   So can you imagine going up and down the Grand Canyon
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.780]   with 40 pounds on your back?
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.420]   That's heavy.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.580]   So yeah, they actually said--
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.380]   I was listening to an NPR story on this this morning.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.100]   And they said that they specifically
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.700]   picked people to wear these things.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.780]   They had to pass a little bit of a physical, apparently.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.500]   I would think they'd want to hire people,
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.540]   guys who walk around there all the time, right?
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.500]   Or strong, tough.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.860]   Yeah, they're probably there, too.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.380]   But they're just not wearing the backpacks.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.780]   And the really cool thing about this, too,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.860]   is they have Android apps.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.980]   I'd never seen this before.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.940]   But they actually have Android apps that talk to the backpacks.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.860]   And they can control what's going on with the cameras
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:55.860]   and the system and monitor the heat and all this kind of stuff
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.180]   with an app that they built that runs right on Android.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.260]   So they're walking around with a thing on their back.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.700]   But they're looking down at their phone.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.020]   Hopefully, they don't fall off the edge.
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:03.700]   Geez.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:07.740]   Actually, one of these guys is a Google engineer.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:13.420]   And it captures images every 2 and 1/2 seconds, 15 cameras,
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.580]   5 megapixels each.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.180]   Holy cow, that must be incredible.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.140]   Yeah, it's incredible pieces of technology.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.100]   And can you imagine, I can't wait
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.940]   till these actual images of the Grand Canyon come out.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.940]   It's going to be really nice.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:28.500]   It's a good way for Google, again, to get some lock-in.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.140]   Because the more of this they do, the harder it is for Apple
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.300]   or anybody else to do it.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.100]   Right.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.580]   I wish they'd use it for some news events.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.740]   Oh, yeah, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:41.300]   Really good amazing perspectives.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:41.980]   What do you think--
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.380]   OK, we got an election coming up in the US
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.460]   in a couple of weeks, I hear.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.620]   What do you think?
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.060]   Are there going to be some interesting--
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.500]   there's the Google CNN campaign explorer.
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.740]   You're going to talk about that, CNN a bit.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.060]   But do you think technology is going
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.340]   to change how we participate in election night?
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:01.620]   Or in election day?
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.460]   No, I think it did have an effect on the debates.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.660]   I think the fact that we can vote early in many states,
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.420]   and I vote absentee.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.820]   So I'm going to be in Azerbaijan that week.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.380]   I think that some of it's kind of over.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.420]   I don't know, election night.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.900]   There was a great piece in the Sunday times,
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:25.500]   last Sunday, about how if you can look at search information,
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.780]   you can-- you know a lot more about the election
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:31.020]   than any pollster could know, because people lie to pollsters,
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.740]   but they don't lie to Google.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:35.740]   And you could tell from what they're searching for.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.660]   That's interesting, Leo.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.980]   For instance, Paul Ryan shirtless
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.100]   is Googled nine times more often than Paul Ryan budget.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.340]   See, people would never admit that.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.780]   That is so depressing.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.020]   But I'm doing it right now.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.260]   Now this is weird, because Paul Ryan shirtless
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.220]   is Googled more often in blue states than red states.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.140]   So apparently Democrats are just sexist as hell.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.420]   Well, he had these beefcake shots.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.500]   Are there?
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.620]   They're kind of.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:10.340]   Yeah, did he do look some kind of goofy photo shoot
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.100]   at some point?
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.260]   Yeah, because he does all that.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.460]   He's just PX90 stuff, right?
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.460]   Or what is he--
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:14.820]   See that?
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.420]   I have to say, Ryan is probably the best looking
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.660]   ticket ever in the history of residential elections.
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:24.060]   I mean, those are two handsome guys.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.300]   Hey, girl, let's get this.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.660]   She found the tumble log.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:31.340]   I did.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.100]   Let's get this.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.140]   All right, Leo, Leo, throw this out.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.500]   I will bet you now that two people in this country already
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.740]   know who's going to be president.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.700]   And those two people are Larry Page and Mark Sepp.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.940]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.980]   They have data.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.660]   And they really-- you can't really do anything with it,
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.020]   because it would seem to then be having an impact, right?
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.300]   Star Trek, prime directive.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.620]   I'll bet they--
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.620]   I bet you're right.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.140]   I bet you're right.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.380]   They are from the future, and they're not allowed to tell us.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.380]   Well, these things are sometimes hard to gauge, though, too,
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.980]   like the influence of social media in general.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.700]   Since we're in a time zone, we have different time zones
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.860]   in the country as things happen.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.660]   And it's always been this way even on TV.
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.460]   But I wonder how much more so social media
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.580]   will have an impact this year as things are happening,
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:21.100]   as polls are closing in various Eastern time zones
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:21.820]   and things like that.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:24.620]   And then they start moving forward.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:29.940]   In 2008, how frequently people in a state
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:34.300]   searched for Obama jokes almost perfectly predicted
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.620]   Obama's vote share--
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.500]   I'm sorry, John McCain's vote share.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.500]   In other words, the more they searched for Obama jokes,
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.340]   the more likely McCain was going to win that state.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:46.820]   And I just want to point out that Romney jokes are
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.900]   very popular in Iowa and Ohio.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.740]   No, that's good.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.740]   Leading into kids.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:53.900]   Well, it depends who you're for.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.540]   It's bad if you're a Romney fan.
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:57.020]   It's good if you're a Romney fan.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:59.460]   No, yeah, because they're searching for Romney jokes,
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:03.060]   it means that these swing states may go Obama.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.380]   And the problem is the polls are all over the place.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.460]   Because people lie, they say, oh, yeah, I'm going to vote.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.620]   And they don't vote.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.020]   There was a shark week rerun, and they
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.380]   had to stay home and watch that.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:17.060]   Vote?
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.020]   There's sharks on TV.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.540]   What are you crazy?
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.740]   Anyway, I read this article.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.020]   I thought it was very interesting.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.460]   But I think you nailed it.
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:32.420]   I think, Jeff, I think Larry and Mark know already.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.820]   I've become a devotee of the 538 blog of the New York Times.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.780]   Oh, I love Nate Silver.
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.220]   He's just great.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.780]   Nate's really great and does wonderful things on--
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.980]   Have you had a date on triangulation?
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.820]   No, let's get him.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.260]   Chaps, make a note.
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.020]   Thank you.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.380]   He'd be grabbing some of the elections over.
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.940]   He's a little busy right now.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.900]   But going to-- using whatever historical data
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:53.300]   is available and going across multiple sources
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.700]   and then trying to give a percentage prediction of what's
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:01.540]   what I would love to unleash Nate Silver onto Google data.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:09.820]   And also, Cam Marlow, right, at Facebook.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.420]   Exchiahu, Camar and Marlow, I think of this, right?
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.700]   Who's their stats guy, their social stats guy?
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.580]   Incredible data that's going to go on there.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.180]   And when they get enough elections that are they're
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:22.380]   held, and as it's been said, not just presidential elections,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.700]   but also more frequent house and senate elections,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.460]   you'll start to be able to see patterns that will become
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.540]   strict polls.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.220]   If your Fitbit can predict when you're going to get a heart
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.820]   attack, then it's going to predict the country's vote.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.260]   I mean, there's just so much more data available right now.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.220]   If you're a statistician or a pollster,
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.740]   over the past four or eight years,
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.700]   I mean, you must be pulling your hair out.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.660]   I don't know if you send this through a MapReduce engine
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.940]   or what, but there's just so much more data right now
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.620]   to analyze than there ever was before.
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.100]   That's why Nate's having such fun.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:56.260]   All right.
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.380]   We're going to get to our tool.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.100]   This is an app or post segue into our tool tip
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.820]   and number of the week, starting with you, Gina Trapani,
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.900]   and your tool of the week.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:11.420]   Google and CNN launched Google's new campaign explorer.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.140]   If you go to google.com/elections,
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.100]   there's a link there for Explorer.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.620]   It lets you visualize app spending, fundraising,
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.260]   candidate travel from the presidential campaigns,
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.780]   the US presidential campaigns on an electoral map, which
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.660]   is pretty cool.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.460]   There's some really good, neat data here.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.500]   This is for developers.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.620]   They really need HTML5 app for political junkies.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.460]   Just neat to see what's going on.
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.460]   You can dive in a data for a state, compare multiple states.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.580]   You can save and share snapshots with your own insights.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.300]   So it's cool.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.300]   You can just click around the map
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.100]   and see what's happening with the different candidates
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.260]   in different states and compare.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.180]   And everything's in red and blue, and it's really pretty,
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:50.660]   and snappy, and Leo is demonstrating right now.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:51.620]   Actually, chat is.
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.260]   Yeah, Colorado versus Ohio.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.900]   Colorado versus Ohio.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:58.020]   Wow, this is just great.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:58.900]   What is that neat?
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.900]   That's fun raising and travel.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.460]   Very cool.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:07.900]   Campaign Explorer, easiest to find at google.com/elections,
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.060]   which is a big elections news page.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:11.580]   But up there in the menu, there's
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.180]   a list of things, including YouTube Live Explorer.
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.380]   What are they going to do with YouTube Live?
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.020]   I guess that YouTube really is getting into--
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.340]   they've got all the debates.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:24.260]   But I imagine they'll do campaign coverage, too, right?
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.860]   I know a lot of people who watch the debates on YouTube.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.300]   I did.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.220]   A lot.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.700]   After the fact, you're live.
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.380]   After the fact.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:31.580]   Both.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:31.940]   Both.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.580]   I tried to watch them live when I had time.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:39.340]   I'm not going to be here because I'm going to Australia,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   but we're going to do--
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.380]   I think we're going to do election-like coverage.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.140]   But not like of like, who's winning.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.460]   But of, I don't know.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.580]   Yeah, we're going to do some stories about what's
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.700]   happened with the tech.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:54.740]   We'll probably use this google.com/elections tool.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.020]   Interesting.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.940]   That'll be with Tom Merritt, just remember Young.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.020]   A few other people don't tell me.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:00.620]   Nice.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.420]   That would be interesting.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.620]   Just remember Young is our John Stewart.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.780]   He will add the comedy side to that.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.540]   Very nice tool.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.420]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.300]   How about a number from you, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:10.740]   All right.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.140]   Well, we're supposed to be with the election theme.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.380]   I could go with the fact that Iceland's voters
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.820]   approved their crowdsource constitution
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.660]   to go to the next step.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.660]   That's amazing.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.660]   That's just amazing.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:20.180]   That's just amazing.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:25.860]   I also love that there are 66% of the half of Iceland's 235,000
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:28.220]   qualified voters, estimated.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.860]   So it's a town.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:32.500]   But I'll do this instead.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.100]   Ugov has the top brands for right and left.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.020]   So the top brand for Democrats?
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:42.460]   Google, followed by Amazon, Cheerios, Clorox, and Craftsman,
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.660]   I guess that's because we work hard.
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:44.660]   I use all of those.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.100]   The Republicans.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:46.980]   OK.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.780]   Top brand.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.260]   Do you get one guess?
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.260]   Fox News.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.220]   Fox News.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:52.580]   OK.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.980]   Followed by the history channel.
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:54.940]   Followed by Craftsman.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.980]   Followed by Chick-fil-A.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:57.500]   We know why that is.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.020]   Chick-fil-A.
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.100]   How funny.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.180]   So Craftsman was in--
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.340]   do you say Craftsman was in both?
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:02.700]   It was both.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.900]   It was also in the independent voters.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:07.300]   I think that's kind of a blue collar thing, right?
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.500]   People actually sold it for the day.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.340]   I'm a Stanley guy.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.580]   I'm more of a Stanley guy.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.380]   And Craftsman.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:12.380]   Craftsman.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.980]   Craftsman's OK.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.500]   Or steel.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.900]   I like steel.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.340]   You think Craftsman's better?
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:17.620]   OK.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:24.060]   So Lisa, who's very handy, says Craftsman's better.
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.980]   Interesting.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   John, do you have an opinion on tools?
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.340]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.300]   Craftsman's lifetime.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.140]   You're a T.
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.780]   I guess so.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.740]   So I didn't even know that.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.100]   I just buy whatever the hell I--
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.460]   I'm surprised Coke wasn't on this list.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.860]   Yeah, what about the average brand?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.100]   Well, you have a friend.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:40.740]   It's you, Calvin.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.900]   I don't know what their mother don't do.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.900]   Yeah, Apple has definitely left us.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.140]   Yeah, it has Levi is left.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:47.820]   Levi too.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.660]   It's in San Francisco.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:51.380]   Yeah, Tommy--
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.060]   Tommy Town.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.140]   Beautiful USA.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.580]   Chatroom's now telling me Craftsman's a lifetime warranty.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.340]   Apparently, I'm just out of it.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.060]   Leo, Leo, Leo.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.620]   If a Craftsman tool breaks, Sears will replace it free.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.740]   He's nodding.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.340]   Like, yeah, that's common knowledge.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.540]   Craftsman's the Chromebook.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.140]   So out of it.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:11.900]   Of tools.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.060]   Aaron, do you have--
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.060]   maybe that's it.
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.740]   You know, I'm just a snob.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.740]   People have been telling me this on Twitter all week
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.660]   that I'm a snob.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.140]   And I guess I am.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:20.900]   I'm a snob.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.660]   And proud of it.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.580]   I guess I don't know.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.500]   I'm just better than you all.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.460]   Does that make me a snob?
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.420]   If that makes me a snob, so be it.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:30.700]   Did you know the Tupperware will do the lifetime guarantee
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.340]   thing too?
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.100]   Tupperware too?
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.020]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.460]   How do you know that, Chad?
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:38.500]   You have Tupperware, and if it breaks, you send it back.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.860]   And it doesn't burp right.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.360]   Right.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.340]   How do you know it's broken?
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:45.460]   We have cups from the '70s.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.460]   Yeah, everyone can see them.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.620]   If those go bad, just send them back.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:49.620]   Like, if they stand up the door--
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.500]   I have cups that are older than you, Chad.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.980]   They stain, or if they crack.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.300]   You don't want a cracked cup.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.020]   So Mr. Aaron, I'm going to give you the chance
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.300]   to do a number, a tool, a tip, anything you want.
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:02.300]   All right, I'm going to do an app.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.460]   A app can be great.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.460]   So I'm going to show you an app that I wrote in App Inventor.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.620]   I think you guys have talked about it.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.540]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:09.940]   They stopped doing that, right?
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.420]   They moved it to MIT.
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.700]   So MIT is running it.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:13.900]   Yeah, they're running with it now,
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.700]   and they've got a lot of great tutorials.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:19.700]   And so my daughter is being a robot for Halloween.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.660]   And I thought, wouldn't it be cool?
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.340]   Actually, I think it was--
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.180]   Think-Eak came out with this stomp pan.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.020]   Yeah, we talked about that yesterday in the Gizwiz.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.620]   Right, so I didn't want to fork out 40 bucks, because I'm cheap.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.500]   So I said, well, I'll just write an app to do the same thing.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.900]   Using the accelerator in the phone.
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.900]   Using the accelerometer.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.860]   Now, this is beta version.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.940]   I made it just good enough to work for my daughter, basically.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.220]   But you can get this on the market.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.300]   And it took me about 24 hours to put together.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.060]   It's on the market.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:43.900]   It's on the market.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.860]   It's called Sound Shaker.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:46.780]   I'm not trying to advertise the app,
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:49.660]   but my point is that if you haven't tried App Inventor,
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.580]   you should really try it, because it's
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.220]   a really, really good learning tool.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.940]   Now, you're a professional programmer.
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.740]   No, I'm a hobbyist programmer.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.820]   I don't program as part of my day job.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.100]   But it took me no time.
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.620]   I had never used it before.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.980]   Everything is like little puzzle pieces that fit together.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.260]   The if/then statements are little blocks.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.260]   And it all fits together.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.260]   Sound.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.260]   Sound Shaker.
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.260]   Shaker.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.260]   Sound Shaker.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.260]   Fart Shaker.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.260]   Oh, there it is, Aaron Nukem.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:16.260]   The red speaker icon.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.260]   That's a good--
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.260]   That's a very nice icon.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:24.260]   So what you do is you just pick a sound on your phone.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.260]   And hold your phone the way it will be when you--
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.260]   you know, like a starting position.
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.260]   And hit calibrate.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.260]   And that'll kind of load those values in.
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.260]   So pick a sound.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.260]   So let me see what the choices are.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.260]   Do you have ES file explorer, by the way?
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.260]   Oh, you have to have ES file.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:38.260]   That's a--
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.260]   Unfortunately, I can't get it around that.
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.260]   So try it with--
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.260]   So let's do it over here.
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:42.260]   We'll do it this way.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.260]   I've got the sound loaded.
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:45.260]   I've calibrated it based on that angle right there that you're holding it.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:46.260]   So you did robot step.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.260]   Yep.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:48.260]   So now hit start.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.260]   Start.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.260]   Now if you shake it, it should-- let's see if it works.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.260]   Live demo.
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260]   Oh, it's on now.
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.260]   Turn it up.
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.260]   Sound's not turned up.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:57.260]   Because you're on a show right now.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:58.260]   Yep.
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.260]   Trying to be a good guest.
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.260]   How do I turn up the sound on this thing?
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.260]   Oh, there it is.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.260]   Okay.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.260]   There it goes.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.260]   Oh, it's making noise.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:10.260]   If you shake it too often.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.260]   There you go.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.260]   Now it's going.
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.260]   So it's pretty good.
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:20.260]   I just point out that everybody in our live studio has their phone out and is downloading
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.260]   that.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.260]   So I mean, you know--
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.260]   Much of Android users out there.
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.260]   That's awesome.
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.260]   It's a really simple little app.
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.260]   It's not guaranteed to work every time.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:30.260]   I just got it to the point where I could make it work for.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.260]   But the point is, is if you're in education or you want to teach programming and you want
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.260]   to do it, go look at App Inventor.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.260]   They've got some great tutorials and the simple videos and walkthroughs.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:44.260]   You really should go look at it because it's a great way, I think, anyway, to teach programming
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.260]   to kids.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.260]   So there you go.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.260]   Very, very cool.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.260]   I'm glad MIT is taking good care of it.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.260]   They seem to be.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.260]   The one thing that they haven't done that I really hope they do is the ability to export
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:56.260]   the code so that it actually can be imported into.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:00.260]   You can export the code, but it's not importable into something like Eclipse or the Android
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.260]   SDK.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.260]   So if they do that, I think it would be great because I think kids are going to get it
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:07.260]   into this and they're going to say, "Oh, now I want to go do something really complicated
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.260]   that they might not be able to do an App Inventor and they're going to get stymied."
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.260]   Right.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.260]   Yep.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.260]   So you mentioned, I'll just do this real quickly because, you know, by the way, triangulation's
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.260]   coming up, Jonathan Abrams is here.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.260]   Remember who that is?
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.260]   He created Friendster.
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:27.260]   And he's back with actually a really cool, you'll be interested in this, Jeff, social news
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.260]   site called Nuzzle.
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.260]   And he's easy.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:32.260]   I haven't gotten into it yet.
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:33.260]   Awesome.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:34.260]   You're going to watch.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.260]   I check it every day now.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.260]   I love Nuzzle.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.460]   So Jonathan Abrams will be joining us.
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:43.260]   But meanwhile, I said I would mention, now I did try the Google Calendar and it's nice.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.700]   I mean, it's fine.
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.660]   And I've been using S Planner because I use Samsung phones and that's the calendar that
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:48.660]   comes with it.
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.160]   But I ended up buying and it wasn't cheap.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.060]   I think it was five, maybe 10 bucks, something called business calendar, very generic name.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:58.660]   But I like it a broad variety of widgets, which is very important to me.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:05.140]   In fact, the widgets let you create and set new appointments on it.
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:08.380]   It has a variety of views, which is always great.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:14.060]   The month view is as you would expect, except that it's doing little colors here so you
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.060]   can kind of get an idea.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:19.580]   And you could pick individual calendars, turn them off and on from the month view.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.540]   It even has a year view.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.900]   You could select calendars.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.140]   But I particularly like it.
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.500]   I use the agenda view.
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.900]   I particularly like it because of the choice of widgets.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:34.220]   And I just also think it's a little bit prettier than I can select a period of time and then
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.220]   we'll show that.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:39.940]   It's just a little bit prettier than the generic Google Calendar and it has a lot of functionality,
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.940]   which is fantastic.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.420]   So it's called business calendar.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:43.420]   I'm not sure how much it is.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   There it is.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:45.420]   $4.99.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:46.420]   All right.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.420]   I tried a lot.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.340]   Callin' Goo, which seems very popular.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:54.220]   I don't like very much aesthetics mostly.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:58.820]   But I think this is a pretty good business calendar.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.820]   That's it.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.820]   Now, Lizard, 70-- oh, yes.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:01.820]   Jonathan Abrams.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.500]   She was telling me that Jonathan Abrams is here.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.380]   So we're going to do that.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.020]   I guess that's it.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.500]   Thank you, Aaron, for sticking around.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.500]   You've been here all day.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.500]   Great, no problem.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.500]   Always nice to have you.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.500]   It's always good to be here with you guys.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:19.020]   Next week, it will be the founder and former CTO of Best Buy and the founder of the Geek
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.020]   Squad.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.020]   Robert Stevens.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.540]   Robert Stevens will join us in studio.
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:23.540]   That's very interesting.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:25.540]   Um.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.540]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:28.540]   He teaches journalism there.
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:32.220]   The author of Public Parts' blog is BuzzMachine.com.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.660]   Always great to have you.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.900]   I lied all the week.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.900]   Yes.
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.100]   Gina Trapani, the new mom.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.900]   The sleep deprived new mom.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:42.820]   Honestly, sorry I was a little quiet today.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:43.820]   Would not have known.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:44.820]   You were fabulous.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:45.820]   Look at that.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.820]   Look at that.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.940]   Here's a guy with Jeff's book in the front row.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.940]   Jeff, just come here.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:50.940]   Come here.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.940]   Hold it up to the TV.
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:52.940]   Bring it over to the TV.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.940]   Just have Jeff.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:54.940]   Come here.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:55.940]   Come here.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:56.940]   Hold it up right over there.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.940]   You got to get closer.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.940]   It doesn't work if you're that far away.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:36:59.940]   Just hold it up to the TV.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.940]   Right here.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:01.940]   Right.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:02.940]   He's the guy.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:03.940]   He's walking around.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   You don't want to be on camera?
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:05.940]   Are you in a witness protection program?
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   There he is.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.940]   Okay.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:08.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:09.940]   Show us the shirt though.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:10.940]   I want to see the shirt.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:11.940]   This is a great shirt.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.940]   Come here.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:13.940]   It's got all the little androids on it.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:14.940]   It's got little androids on it.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:15.940]   Oh, I'm jealous.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:16.940]   That's great.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:17.940]   Super fan.
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:18.940]   Right on.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.940]   Do you work for Google or you just were there at the store?
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.940]   No.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:21.940]   Where are you from?
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:22.940]   Mexico City.
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:23.940]   Mexico City.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:24.940]   Nice to see you.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.940]   Thank you.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:27.940]   One way.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.940]   Along way.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.940]   Leo, would you write a graph up for me?
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.940]   API guru.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:33.940]   Wow.
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.940]   He's a developer.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:36.940]   Ah.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:37.940]   Yes.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:41.940]   Will I wrap that up for you?
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:42.940]   Jeff?
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:43.940]   Yes.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.940]   We'll send it.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:45.940]   If you would autograph it for.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:46.940]   I will autograph it.
