[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.120]   Hi stacey
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.920]   You need some sheer sound effects. We also need stacey's audio. Oh, there we go. Sorry. Hi. I was like the doorbell just rang
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   So there is barking in the background. I love trying to spare y'all
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.240]   We want we want parts of real life. Yeah, you know what you're getting really like actually really true jeff javis
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.720]   uh from the
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.600]   craig new mark school of journalism the craig new mark graduate school journalism at kuny
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.840]   I'm very very proud to say that we have just renamed our school thanks to an incredibly generous gift from my friend craig new mark
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.320]   20 million dollars to assure our independence so he makes billions putting newspapers out of business
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.200]   uh
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   kicks back a few crumbs
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.760]   So this has been driving
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   The smart people nuts online because if people people repeat that that trope that idiocy
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.040]   uh, he didn't uh
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.200]   Look at me billions be he didn't ruin newspapers. Uh, what ruined newspapers was the internet coming along and getting rid of
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.520]   uh, the middleman and their rapacious monopolistic pricing
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.760]   So it was monster and real estate agents and job agents and
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   Cardilers all went their own way. They didn't need the papers anymore
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   And we just stood back stupidly so no craig didn't ruin newspapers and craig is doing a lot of good for journalism now including
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.080]   Sporting cuny a wonderful institution. That's nice
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.120]   Does uh what happens to the town night folks?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.360]   Do they just slink away with the tails between their legs? No, no, I run the townite center for entrepreneurial driven. Okay, so here's my full title
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.280]   Yeah, you ready? Yeah, lord. Yeah, I haven't done this yet. I haven't done this yet
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.160]   Hello. Hi. I'm jeff javis
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.040]   the lettered towel professor of journalistic innovation and director of the towel night center for entrepreneurial journalism at the craig
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   Newmark graduate school of journalism at the city university of new york brought to you by nike
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:40.020]   Just to it. I was on a
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.520]   That was alie milshame. Oh, they should make alie
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.600]   Alie say the whole thing once just once yeah, yeah
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800]   So you were there to talk about a huge
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.360]   Story which has just gotten
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   Hugeer and I bet you you already predicted this the huge story broke yesterday when a judge
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.960]   cleared
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   AT&T's
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.360]   $85
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.720]   $85 billion bid for time Warner and said no conditions you're in different businesses. No big deal the government
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.840]   Had been seeking to stay this although I have to say
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   It's all tarnished by the fact that there's some evidence the government didn't like it because
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.760]   The president doesn't like cnn
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.400]   Considerable evidence and he continued it from the podium and second port calling cnn fake news to the cnn reporters face
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.120]   Yeah, it was a political vendetta. He had nothing against
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.880]   Disney
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.440]   And and fox but everything against cnn. Yeah, but i
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.560]   However, however, it's still not a great deal for
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.960]   There were no there were good and just reasons for blocking this
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.840]   But but once that happened that's the idea
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.520]   That's the point alie velshame made on the air today
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.800]   The once that happens it even people like himself and me who might have questioned this deal more once that happened we kind of said nope
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.720]   Yeah, it's it's got to go now because we can't allow that kind of political interference
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.040]   Examine that trump will be gone in in in at most six years and this is gonna live forever
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.280]   So i was willing to i was willing to fall in line with trump on this one
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.840]   Yeah, there are a few things that i'm like, oh, yeah, i'd go for that
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.160]   But this would have gone it is a vertical it is a the thing is stacey under the laws it stands and thank goodness at least one third of
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.800]   Government still does follow the law until it's taken over
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   Um, it is a vertical it's a it's a it's a defensible vertical
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.120]   Uh merger. Yeah, it's kind of a meta. It's a meta concept which the law probably doesn't contemplate
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.480]   This is this is why we need to bring it we need to change antitrust law
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.680]   We need to bring it into the 21st century jeff did you disappear?
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.920]   Okay, suddenly you got so dark. It was like talking to a black screen. I don't know. I think i'm here am i here
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.160]   I i
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.720]   I twig therefore i am um, it doesn't matter most people are listening so your voice is just yes as strong
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.200]   I think i keep getting darker there without doing anything and the sun's not doing anything
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.520]   But it's good. Yes. I can't win
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.960]   You're advocating for evil. That's the indication right there. No, um, so
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.520]   So 18 t
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   Uh, of course is a pipe company. They are
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.280]   Yes, they would hate for you to say that but yes, that's what they are they're an in-service provider
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.560]   Uh, they're a common carrier their phone company
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   Rotorruder they are
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.920]   They are not a common carrier as an internet provider. They have not that was but they are a phone company still
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.960]   That's a common carrier
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.280]   Yeah, but i'm saying 18 t is a phone company for a significant number of people in this country
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.400]   But as part of that they also are dsl provider to some and a fiber provided to others as well as their phone
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.800]   so they're both a common carrier and
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   Whatever an information technology information technologies are right? Uh, what they get with time Warner is
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.160]   HBO
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   CNN TNT
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.840]   Uh a lot of pay tv stuff, but they don't uh, what what they don't give movie studio movie studio or time magazine
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   No, no, no, they don't get time. It was sold a marathon timing was sold way long ago
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   It was it was it was uh, it was shot off because it was it has kudos
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.800]   They do get Warner brothers though. They do get the the movie studio. Yeah, they don't time Warner cable
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.960]   You know with soul sometime. You know get spectrum. I make was was was was one off AOL of course responsible
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.600]   This is basically the whole AOL time Warner. This is the last gas pump
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's dead now and actually that's probably why the judge could clear this because had they owned just some of those other things
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.400]   It wouldn't have been as clear
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.280]   Right if they don't have work table, right? That'd be direct
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.320]   I see close to analog is Comcast NBC universal. Yes. Well, that's the other
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   They did go through with conditions
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.720]   That's the other this does bring up the other shoe that just dropped because as i'm sure you noted on alley velshy's show this morning jeff
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.400]   Uh, comcast has been waiting to see what the judge decided before going forward with its bid
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:12.880]   For 21st century fox and they in fact have just now made it up their bid to oh, how's how big is the bid 65 billion?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.800]   Versus disney's what 54 billion i think and are the apples apples are they bidding for the same parts of fox?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.080]   Well, it's up to disney. I think yes. Yes, they are. Yes, it's up to disney now to
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.360]   Up its bid or back out
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.960]   What interests me is that i'm going to be very partisan a little about to say
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:39.120]   Part of what I fear and all this is how much control riverwardock keeps over uh brainwashing minds in america because he keeps fox news
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.920]   But he loses god. He really keeps he keeps the no no fox news goes with I think
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.800]   All right, um, the prince the prince. Yeah, the
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.880]   News Corp has already separated off he keeps that yeah, so that's uh the new york pose
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.960]   Journal that they get the sports stuff. It's so complicated timmy
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.800]   The big issue is that the pipe companies comcast and atnt are
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.440]   Buying increasing numbers of content companies nbc is already owned by comcast
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.080]   uh atnt will own
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.560]   uh cnn and are they taking on any debt to do this?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.760]   Oh man, you're asking tough questions because or atnt both because because that's what did in the newspaper business, right?
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   All of the all of the consolidation
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   comcast is an all cash
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.200]   Concast is an all cash deal. It's uh, they take an
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.720]   Deaf all stock deal. Ah, but i take an eight yet
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.760]   I'm looking for atnt because the deaths what what what kills you in these cases
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.120]   I mean in a sense, lea like i argue that this is the dinosaur is huddling together against the cold wind of the internet and
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.440]   Netflix and amazon i'd agree with you except that these as pipe companies these guys also are gatekeepers to the internet
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.880]   Yes, and with the fall of net neutrality on monday
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.240]   There is a very scary confluence of factors that worry me a little bit
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.200]   concentration of
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.920]   Information sources but also concentration of power
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.560]   And I would argue this and they'll see this if this gives you
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.120]   Help me. Do you want do you want me to answer your debt question before you get
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   Just first a first say this might give you palpitations
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.440]   Uh in terms of companies that are too big that could do scary things that were frightened of the raffle
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.160]   I have a lot more faith in google and facebook than i do in comcast and atnt
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.480]   I'm more scared of that. I am
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.520]   Miss guided on that. I think they're all just about as bad. Oh, I didn't listen to you jeff. Well, who were you more scared of?
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.640]   I'm more scared of us usual stacey. Why did you change? I was looking up dead
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.600]   You were doing work for me because I was too lazy
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.160]   Um, I'm more scared of of comcast and atnt than I am of google and facebook
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.480]   And and all this attention is going to google and facebook is the big scary companies
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.960]   Comcast atnt have far worse culture. I have far more power to do bad stuff or rip it us off
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.120]   Uh have impact on speech that's greater. I I agree
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.960]   Evil empire the difference to them google and facebook is they've google and facebook at least continue to pay lip service
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.200]   to uh fairness and equality and don't not being evil atnt
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.880]   Comcast long ago gave up any pretense a man. So stacey what you find?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.920]   okay, so
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.080]   atnt's deal
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.840]   Does include now i gotta go back to it. I got distracted see this is
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.720]   The deal
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.320]   Jeff it worked their total debt load is 163 billion
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:45.120]   After this deal when they take on time warner's debt, it's going to be at 185 billion
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.800]   But they say that uh debt to e-bitter ratio. They're going for after the deal is 2.5x
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.480]   So that's
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.920]   Hi, but that's not out of whack with the tell it's got unmanageable. Okay. Yeah, so that's what
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.240]   earnings before income depreciation and taxes so they're saying their debt to income ratio is two to one
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.960]   Basically their debt to net income is 2.5. So that's not
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.400]   Awful. I mean if you own a home your debt to income ratio is probably a little worse than well, but
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.680]   In atnt also has a lot of physical assets. So you I mean when we're talking about this sort of thing
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.240]   I'm sure they're making they they can make a strong case to their shareholders that this makes them more valuable and that revenues will go up to
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   to meet the debt
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.760]   It's a risky thing to do. I mean this is what almost brought down clear channel the company I work for on the radio
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.960]   Uh, and they only had 20 billion dollars in debt
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.080]   Uh was that they bought they they borrowed a lot of money to buy radio stations and even though their cash fought very good cash flowing
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.640]   It's hard to service
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.800]   $20 billion in debts really hard to service $185 billion in debt atnt can service 185 billion in debt
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   They're looking they're saying that they'll see a hunt or they'll see one billion an annual
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.120]   Say or they call it run rate cost synergies within three years that deal
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.840]   Um, I'm not worried about that. What they're going to get is the think about how these guys play today. So
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.720]   Remember all of those fun
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.080]   franchise
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.280]   Disagreement dramas that pop up every now and then with the cable guys and the isp's
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   The cable guys so people who own cable and they fight with the entertainment companies over how much they're going to pay to run their channels
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.680]   Mm-hmm. So this gives atnt just like
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.840]   Have those fights anymore?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:43.280]   Well, you have different leverage in those fights. The other thing is like with the end of net neutrality. We could see the beginning of
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.640]   packages that
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.920]   Zero rate or that even not just advantage but like hey, you can have all of the atnt channels on this for free
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:02.320]   Um, just sign up for our broadband our quadplay whatever however much they want to have in it more zero rated content on atnt
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:09.680]   And Comcast the worst it is for independence like me like twit. Yep. Yep. It in effect costs you
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.640]   To watch the independence when it doesn't cost you to watch the other guys and that's right
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.040]   Utrelleby so and I don't know if we're going to see this actually play out in net neutrality ways
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.640]   So I don't know if we're going to see much
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.720]   Advantaging on the actual packet flow for these things. I think what will be interesting is we might see
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.680]   Advantaging against data caps. So both Comcast and atnt have data caps
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.400]   That's a little bit more subtle for people, but it's closer to what's happening on
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   The mobile side and the fcc is already said yeah, okay, that's cool
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.040]   Yeah, so that that'll be an interesting thing to watch tom wheelers fcc was very
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:55.200]   They were interested in bad behavior on data caps. I can't imagine a jeep pie really giving a hoot at so ever
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.480]   And technically by the way fcc would still have to rule just because the judge gives a go ahead
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.320]   Although I did note that uh atnt said yeah, we're going to close this next week
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.680]   So I don't think they anticipated any slowdowns
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.960]   From federal judge essentially told them don't told them doj don't bother that's the doj
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.640]   But the fcc technically could still weigh in but uh, yeah, you don't think I doubt it
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.920]   So you said something very interesting jeff and I wanted to kind of uh pursue
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.600]   Note that in the history books. That's good. You always say stuff that's interesting. I always get very interested in that
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.400]   You're not always right, but sometimes you
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.280]   Uh, and in fact steve case echoes as he was asked by cnbc or steve case was the
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.600]   AOL executive during the time Warner AOL merger, right?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.080]   He uh, that's because of him is because of him my f u money said f u to me
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.800]   Yes, that uh, they split into companies after the merger several years after the merger. It was a failure
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.840]   Case warned atnt according to cnbc against suffering the same fate
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:04.560]   He said that really what's going on and echoing your statement jeff atnt and time Warner and fox and comcast and others are really
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.240]   Playing deviance sense. Yes. They're really worried about their position in the future compared to facebook
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.640]   Netflix and amazon
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.520]   So what is the threat?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.160]   Well, ama netflix pays for more
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:25.920]   Original programming than any network ever 8 billion amazon's here and and and netflix and amazon and facebook and google
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.560]   All have far more
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.360]   Well, no actually your carrier does have a lot of data on you. They just don't know how the hell to use it
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   I disagree so they have use it and they're you they're just using it not in as a
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.160]   Obvious away, but I think they're not using a smart way to give you what you want
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.800]   They're not thinking in a customer centered way, right? Um to give you more relevance and more of what you want and and sell that wisely
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.400]   So the carriers for a while weren't allowed to use all the data they had they that actually was taken
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.720]   They solved that problem
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.080]   fairly recently in the scheme of things, but I will say there is very much a telco mindset an
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.280]   Isp mindset will call it versus an innovation mindset exact and exact
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.200]   These guys want to control everything
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.800]   They want to run it through their own walled garden and they really don't want to be a commodity service
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   They don't want to be a dumb pipe and that every decision they make is driven by fear of that in an attempt
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.080]   To control and consolidate as much power as they can so they can keep their pipe
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.680]   Super valuable as opposed to a commodity you don't think this is about as as they
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:43.040]   Asserted as diversification putting a sport in traditional waters. You think it's more about consolidation and control
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.960]   I think
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   Having those assets gives them a lot of leeway to negotiate
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.400]   It gives them content that they can actually push to users and kind of keep them locked in
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.040]   so
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   Yes to both is I don't think it's an either or but I will say that
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:11.120]   Of all of the isps the best one and the most innovative actually in the one to watch is also probably the most evil which is Comcast and
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:20.880]   They so when they bought nbc you it made a ton of sense just like at and t doing this today makes a ton of sense
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.400]   We all knew the video was going to go to the internet. No nobody was like oh, that's not going to happen
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.920]   Even even the cable providers knew so getting that content in helps preserve
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.960]   Your quadplay or your your triple play or your
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.600]   Separate play
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:45.040]   I mean Comcast if you think about it, they're actually up to like a quintuple play because they've got broadband
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.520]   They're starting wireless. They've got
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.240]   phone phone and home security now
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.480]   Right home security service and that's a quintuple play quintuple play
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.440]   So if you're a pipe company
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.840]   And net neutrality is gone
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.040]   It wouldn't have made more sense to put all that money into strengthening your position as the carrier
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.520]   uh
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.960]   This is human behavior. You gotta worry about two. You're not just worrying about the
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   Um, yeah, you don't want to be a dumb pipe. That's where you don't you don't want to be a dumb
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.280]   commodity
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.880]   But what but if you're a desert
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.960]   And there's no net neutrality rules, which means you're also a gatekeeper. You're not that dumb
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.400]   Because that is gonna happen is wireless is going to kill your monopoly. Ah
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.720]   Right. So that's a that's a that's not a strong monopoly. So here's the here's the
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.760]   Go ahead. Go on Jeff. Okay. No, you go. I was gonna start a parlor game. I'll start in a minute. You go
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   Okay, so we also have to think about 5g which is coming down the pipe
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.440]   And I'm not saying this in some bse kind of 5g will save the world thing
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:54.320]   I'm talking about specifically fixed wireless delivered via facebook and google which they are both investing in
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.440]   So if you look at that these guys are saying
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   The telcos are like holy cow the one thing i've got
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.320]   Well, two things i've got is a kick butt wireless network and I have
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.840]   Fiber and fiber in the ground basically these guys are coming through and saying hey
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.120]   We're going to do that last mile my mile fiber which means you can have the rings and there are other companies building rings
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   Facebook has their own fiber. So
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.120]   this is
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.200]   This is where it's getting interesting. So diversification matters too
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.240]   Because they're going to need some more money
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.640]   Their networks are not going to be monopolies possibly for much longer everywhere else. I see a content
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.320]   Monopoly also shattering though. They're very worried about youtube
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.160]   Last night I had an epiphany. I went home and instead of watching tv
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.800]   I watched microsoft streaming gaming service their competitor to twitch which is owned by amazon called mixer
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.360]   And I watched the fortnite pro am which was professional esports
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.480]   Gamers it was very excited playing fortnite. It was very exciting
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.720]   There was a three get this three million dollar purse
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.920]   The winning team won but it was for charity which is even more interesting the winning team won a million dollars for their charity
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.560]   Is these two young guys where they're playing fortnite which is very popular game right now
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:29.360]   Yeah, uh, so there you have that you've got microsoft mixer coming on strong. I mean there's all these channels were on it now
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.560]   by the way
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.680]   There's
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.080]   Amazon's twitch were also on that there's youtube were also on that
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.800]   Leo isn't that dumb
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.520]   Those three to me, uh, and then I look at people under 25
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.160]   They're not going home and watching
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.440]   Nbc they're not watching two and a half men
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.880]   They're watching youtube and twitch and mixer and they're playing those games
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.560]   And I you know it's interesting because I'm watching it and the part of the epiphany was
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.840]   Uh, how it's presented which from my old media eye looks very kind of amateurish
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.640]   Just as i'm sure jeff to a newspaper man blogs looked pretty damn amateurish
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.080]   Then I is one yeah around that you are one but I realize and now i'm new media
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.680]   But but I realize that the standards that we have in old media very different from what a 20 year old expects not just standard
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.080]   But but the but the the motif the style the voice the style that stuff i'm re i'm rereading um
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   uh
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:35.360]   Mccluen mccluen understand the media is he relevant today's
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.480]   Jesus, it's just amazing and I'm not gonna do him justice
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.800]   So i'm not gonna try to summarize but but his observations and he was so much ahead of
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.240]   He thought that electric media tv radio and such
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   We're gonna do more than they were he was anticipating a hot medium and radio cool medium, right?
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.840]   Yeah, I was get confused. Why can't I still take it my head around. What's said the life is the medium is the message
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:07.360]   Right, so he argues that the form uh is everything we tend to look we we we we miss the frame by looking at the picture
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.040]   um
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.000]   Uh, and and so it's absolutely fascinating how I mean it's a media analysis of all life
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.120]   He argues that media is an extension of our bodies and our neural systems, right? Well, he was right on
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.600]   Yeah, that's exactly what's happened. Oh, it's it's very much so and he considers you know
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.040]   He's fascinating because it's very academic because it is the wheel of medium
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.160]   And steam power and medium and you get him going on gutenberg and on the typewriter
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.960]   The the impact of the typewriter on the way people think
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   Um, you know from what I went from a typewriter to a computer and how it changes and how I wrote
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.720]   Uh completely how how I thought um, uh, so yeah, that's where we are
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Is that you Jeff?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.880]   Unfire is your smoke alarm going off. Yes get the hell out of there
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.120]   No, no, it's okay. It's the air conditioning, but sorry
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.480]   I like it everybody listening at home ran to their smoke alarms
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:08.240]   Some people here's a out of the house already. Here's the parlour game. I want to play
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:16.400]   So, uh, I'll start the bidding here. So I think netflix could now part of what this decision does too is it is it opens up
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   Less antitrust
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.120]   Sruitney of other kinds of deals that could occur
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.520]   See I would think netflix is now in peril because they're a content company, but they don't own the pipes and well
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.360]   That's from kai is again very strong. Do they turn on I want to play the parlour game?
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.640]   So do they buy this netflix by cbs?
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.040]   Does um
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.360]   Google by
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.160]   Who's in play so abc zoned
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.120]   By disney by disney cbs is nbc
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.360]   CBS is way in play because cbs and viacom split up
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.680]   And there's efforts in viacom to bring cbs back in cbs is resisting
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.920]   And so each one is in play. What would why would netflix what would the value of netflix?
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.720]   Buying cbsb
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.680]   I want to hand it's why why the hell would we go by in the past and by that?
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   On the other hand, it's distribution of a sort
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.720]   They need distribution, but I don't think broadcast is the right way. I don't think they care about broadcast distribution
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.760]   What they need is a they need internet so they would they would do well to
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:29.040]   Help fund some sort of shared internet infrastructure. There you go. Nef so here's a tech rich article netflix
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.160]   And alphabet will need to become isp's fast. This is in response to net neutrality
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.720]   But I think it also is no it's all of this every yeah
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.440]   Now
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   Right this guy's saying it will now
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.920]   I don't know if google fiber will actually start back up in the iteration that it's had
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.240]   I really think it's too expensive to do last mile so doing
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:00.560]   fiber to in google lays like in austin they laid all of their metro fiber ring down
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.920]   They didn't use anybody else's and that's very expensive. Yeah, they had to stop
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   If they do that in other places and they rely on like 5g
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:16.400]   To do everything else. Why why I think you read wireless is is obviously the only way you can if you're not an incumbent you can play
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.480]   Now
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.280]   But you have to own your back haul if you're going to be a five if you're going to use fixed wireless at some point in time
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.880]   You have to get back on the internet now getting the ground with those fiber reads
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.920]   Google and google has fiber so they could actually do it as opposed to like like t mobile today porti mobile
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.480]   You know, they're it could do everything they want in their radio network, but when they get to their towers
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.560]   They're still paying Verizon and at and t
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.520]   Back off so there used to be the story that there's all this dark fiber
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.360]   In the united states. It's like deep state
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:00.960]   And is it is it avail who owns all this dark fiber? Is it the incumbents? Is it no? It's a lot of different companies so cities own dark fiber
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.320]   Sometimes they can't use it because the incumbents have written legislation to make it difficult
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:14.560]   Random players. I mean the dark fiber though the thing about fiber is you could have lots of dark fiber
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.440]   But if it's not on a route that needs to be accessed, it's not going to be worth it turning on and that's
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.520]   so
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.440]   You know, we were like, oh dark fiber will save us
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.280]   But it actually really matters where the fiber is and a lot of our fibers between major metro areas, which is not
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.600]   Okay, but google has the resources to
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.320]   acquire the dark fiber it needs for interconnects to build rings where it needs to build rings and to set up
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:49.280]   Wireless where I wonder why they will only they will only do this if at and t and verizon make it
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.440]   necessary
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.080]   So google and you can actually see this
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.880]   Google launched
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.000]   Google fiber in an era where the cable providers were implementing bandwidth caps they were
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.600]   Charging incredible prices for gigabit networks. Do you remember when a gigabit network was like
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.040]   $300 a month or even $500 a month
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.960]   So what happened is when they launched that they actually got pricing down tremendously plus
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.560]   Boosted the base broadband speeds that people would accept so when they launched free broadband
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.320]   I think at 10 gigabits or five not sorry not 10 gigabits of five or 10 megabits per second
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.040]   That actually boosted because Comcast was doing a free broadband program at a much lower data rate
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.920]   So they boosted their free program to meet google's program
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.320]   So when google did this actually had a huge impact on pricing like AT&T came into austin at 70 bucks
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:50.480]   Your gigabit ethernet or your gigabit service now in austin from AT&T is about double that
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   So what's happening is google's
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.720]   Stagnated and the cable guys were like in the isp's were like oh we're back to raising prices
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:06.160]   So until it gets too untenable again and they start implementing crappy policies, which they might because that's what they do
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.400]   Google doesn't actually it's it's better for google to work with them
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.560]   Then it is to actually build a network because that's one of the more expensive things you can do with your money
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.520]   Good parlor game jeff
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.880]   Yeah, so i still want to so so let's try to do some match ups
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.960]   Yeah, let's do some match ups right does somebody buy Netflix Netflix buy somebody
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.000]   What could google buy google google google app apple? We can want to forget about apple has
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.720]   Resilience a cash is getting into content does apple buy Netflix and apple has a
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.360]   buy a content
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:47.440]   Apples always said and I think I I credit them with this because they've been very slow to spend their hundreds of billions of dollars in cash
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.080]   They've always and that which is bad by the way now repatriated so they could buy Netflix with it
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.080]   They've always said that we don't you know there's only a few reasons why you buy a company actually it's been Thompson observed this
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.280]   But I think he's accurate. There's only a few or maybe it was well anyway whoever observed it
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.040]   There's only a few reasons you buy a company want to acquire customers apple doesn't need to do that for sure
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.560]   uh
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.240]   Acquire technology apple does do that but they do small acquisitions, but what you want to be very careful about is
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.320]   Trying to merge corporate cultures that are diverse
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   And I think apple is very reluctant to acquire anything large
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:29.600]   Because it has a very distinct corporate culture and it doesn't want to have to try to merge that with anybody else's corporate culture
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.080]   So I think apple is not I mean apple we've always said could buy the music industry
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.160]   I mean the whole music industry if they wanted to
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.640]   the whole music in it but all of it but uh
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.600]   That that's not really what they're interested in and so they're very very conservative with their acquisitions
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:53.920]   I think so they don't think that if they saw there was a a defensive need or a real aggressive opportunity
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.440]   I don't think in either case now base house is another question that's base house doesn't because he hasn't gone for profit
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.400]   He doesn't have a lot of cash right? Yeah, he has he has but he has equity that's worth of fortune
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.960]   So does he buy Netflix?
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.880]   I think you would actually see them create some sort of shared infrastructure
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.080]   I really do and I think am amazon relies on ban with two don't they?
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.440]   Yeah, they rely tremendous and they get and they get hugely upset when uh
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.400]   When their services don't work because of crappy bandwidth but what I see because again way back in like
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:36.080]   2010 2008 the FCC actually did a national broad and nationwide broadband plan and
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.240]   the cost of putting broadband like everywhere via fiber though was
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   Multiple billions. I mean tens of billions of dollars
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:53.520]   So you're not going to see that kind of effort. I think ever what I think you would see is these guys come together
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.160]   Create a shared infrastructure and use that to squeeze the telcos
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.040]   Because again, they still want to do business with them borizon atnt
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.600]   Comcast they still own
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.600]   The networks that google's trying to run their services over so they can't just go all out to war and
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:18.400]   There's a this is very much. This is very much game of thrones going on right now. Yeah, this is a
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.760]   number of fiefdoms all vying
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:28.800]   To to control it and it's a it's a very interesting chess game because you're right they can't outright fight each other
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.560]   They need to you know, they need the alliances need to form and
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.120]   And break up and people have to this is a very interesting chess game
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:43.040]   I wouldn't keep jeff bezos out of this one. I would if I had to put money on anybody I would put money on him
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.800]   Certainly not atnt or Comcast although Comcast
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.080]   Is really a behemoth now, you know, it owns the largest
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.720]   ISP now
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.240]   Frisened
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.160]   I can actually answer this question for you. Hold on. Do you want it be a telco or just in general?
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   Uh
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.280]   That's interesting. That's interesting question. No one pop. I want cable
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.720]   In cable. Okay, give me two seconds. So
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.440]   AT&T Comcast time Warner cable time Warner has been taken over so hold on
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.880]   All right, Brad van rankings charter is the second largest. Oh, really no way
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.920]   That's a big shift charter did deal with Comcast what oh
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.320]   because they bought the pieces of
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.560]   About the border. They bought. Oh, you're right. Okay. So yeah, so it's Comcast 26 million charter spectrum
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.720]   AT&T charter charter has got to have tons of debt. They can't buy anything
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.360]   So all right. So so does amazon by charter
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.720]   Does that sound doesn't want that?
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.560]   Amazon is gonna face this as an issue though
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.400]   uh
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.200]   Because they've already dealt with this as an issue
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   I just don't these guys have historically they're not gonna get into the networking business unless they absolutely have to
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.560]   In effects there's incentive for Amazon web services
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.680]   No, I know there's incentive, but
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   again right now
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.720]   They're not dumb
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:23.840]   They can build all of this infrastructure on top and create value there and one of the reasons they can do that is because they've created an open
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.440]   infrastructure
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.800]   Like they've created a true platform where the ISPs were like
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.760]   No, our platform will only be for us. So that's just that's on the ISPs. I feel no shame. I feel no pity
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.280]   All right, so looking out into the future the smart thing to do
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   Short-term people might kind of try to occupy the current internet
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   But the smart thing to do would be to build a wireless internet and let's go beyond wireless
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:56.080]   Let's go beyond 5g because you're right you got a backhaul issue. What if we did space-based internet? What if we did satellite internet?
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   latency is gonna kill you
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.280]   um
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.960]   I have to now I'm I'm all very excited about satellite in like internet. It depends on which band you're in
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.440]   That depends on how much how many megahertz the Beatles
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.320]   No, sorry, which
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.760]   When you start talking about doing anything in wireless you have to think about the the amount
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.360]   So they spec measure spectrum and megahertz and they allocated in chunks that are different bands
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   so
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.120]   The number you can only cram so many bits per hertz
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.600]   So you could only like that we're technologically limited in that that Shannon's kind of law that Shannon's law. So
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   You can't go infinite without a huge technological breakthrough. So lte was a breakthrough over 3g
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.920]   5g is less of a breakthrough in terms of being able to cram more information into every hertz of spectrum
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.000]   So you're gonna hit limits there. So you can't do things like 8k television
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.720]   Unless you especially can't do it if you have lots and lots of little players
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.480]   Because they're gonna get lots and lots of little chunks
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:12.240]   Well, that's where satellite succeeds because latency doesn't matter in one way television broadcasting
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.800]   And you can put up enough what is how many satellites is space explaining to put up?
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.560]   Hundreds right of of low earth orbits so there's low latency
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:30.960]   Lower latency lower, but well, but it again doesn't matter for if it's a ktv latency is not an issue at all
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   Well, let's see how many bands we have in the lower earth orbit band. We just can't use it for the show
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.200]   It doesn't help us well latency is not a problem for us either
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.600]   I mean for literally
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.400]   Skype yeah
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.880]   All right down lake how big are your channels?
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.520]   Oh
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Okay, so our f 2020 says that there that
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.080]   Elon Musk must have put up
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.560]   thousands more than 4,000 satellites
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.000]   See e-lines looking at looking at the long game here
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.200]   So and that's and that's actually so the the tinier the more satellites you have the more you it's like having more cell towers
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.040]   So you can actually divide by the number of users that are trying to pull right down link it up
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.920]   real estate for these things
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.560]   Space is a big place Jeff
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:33.360]   Physical real estate or RF real estate though physical running into each other. No, I think we're right there
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.960]   We're gonna do so much with like swarming algorithms and they'll they'll just like magically pass each other
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   But we are spending it's sending a lot of junk into space
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:49.040]   Elon wants to put up 12,000 satellites 4,000 of them for the backhaul 8,000 of them for direct to users
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.920]   12,000
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   Jesus
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.160]   How many can you put in one payload?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.800]   I don't know, but it's interesting that both Bezos and Musk are looking at space
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.600]   Well, that's because they've got a rocket launching program
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:11.280]   I mean if you have a hammer or if that's why they have a rocket launching program. I saw he's saying the reverse Stacy
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's why I know that he's he's got the rocket launching program for
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.160]   I wouldn't put it best either Elon or
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:27.760]   Bezos to a have other plans and and say something about Mars when that they really want to do is
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.200]   Take over the internet. I wouldn't put it past either one of them
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.080]   That's true. I think they're smart enough to be looking at I mean look if we figured this out they must have
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.400]   But okay, but y'all satellite is tough
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:47.280]   And I say this having written for 15 years about satellite everyone wants there's so much
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:54.160]   Challenge there that is really deep and nerdy and boring but so important. So you've got to do impossible
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.640]   I mean if not impossible. You want to say challenge living on Mars is kind of a challenge too. Well, and we're not there yet
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.080]   but I mean Stacy Stacy's right because because the leap from
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.360]   fiber to the home to
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.000]   Fixed wireless itself is big right
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.400]   Fixed wireless is not as good as fiber to the home, which was which is part of Susan Crawford's argument against the
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.040]   Comcast NBCU
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.480]   merger everybody says well, it's okay. We'll get 5g. It'll be okay
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.520]   She says no, it's not ever gonna be what fiber the home is and satellites never gonna be what fixed wireless is
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.880]   Right, right. That's true. Yes. That is your choice. You'd want fiber. I mean don't you remember was it snow crash where they were like
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.120]   You know, they were all
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.680]   Running around having their fun on their their wireless network
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.280]   But when they really wanted to do something serious they had to go to the wide wired network because there just wasn't enough capacity
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.560]   I know that's a fiction, but it's actually based in physics
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.280]   I always you know given the choice. I'm always gonna bet on physics
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.880]   I think it's very it's a very interesting, you know, we're obviously
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.760]   Well, you knew it's
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Stuff that other satellite needs
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:11.680]   You well you need so satellite needs again backhaul is gonna bite you in the butt here because to direct to satellite
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.200]   You need some sort of massive power battery powered
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.320]   Big transmitter and receiver on your handset if you want to do an unhand set
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.920]   What's more likely is you're gonna do satellite to some sort of base station either consumer premise equipment
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.400]   Or a tower like infrastructure. So you're still gonna need that backhaul
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.760]   Does that make sense? Yeah, but you only have to buy a few of those compared to
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.800]   No, it depends on how much capacity you need it depends on all kinds of thing. I mean like
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   You don't just have to have a few
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.000]   It
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.360]   It depends on the nature of your backhaul if you're gonna do fewer than you would if you want to do let terrestrial
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:59.120]   You wouldn't have to do it to the premise, but you would have to have I mean, I guess you could do satellite
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.720]   Let's see
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.280]   Satellite to cpe to Wi-Fi or to 5g wireless
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   You don't have to design the network. We don't have to get that
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.960]   Can you get the whiteboard out?
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.400]   I'm like sitting here going okay. Who do I need to call?
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.440]   Is it possible?
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.480]   Is it possible?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.680]   I don't actually know
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   I wonder I you know, so the parlor game
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.200]   Continues and I think it's a good parlor game
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.880]   Of what what the moves at the next moves are over the next year or two
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.760]   Uh, but but at least for now
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.640]   Is this not bad for consumers, jeff
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.200]   Well, that was the argument I had on tv today and everybody's saying prices are gonna go down. I
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.480]   Don't think so. I think they're gonna go up
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.080]   Uh, but that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with anti-trust
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.840]   It's just it's just that the mass media for me before the mass media ad supported business model is suffering under dying
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.280]   Um free content supported by advertising will become junkier and junkier broadcast tv
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:06.560]   And so I think the reason prices are gonna go up is gonna find more and more stuff going behind walls and people are willing to pay it
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.720]   I mean look at where we're just talking about shows on hbo and uh Netflix
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.240]   And there aren't that many competitors hulu, you know, so you have amazon you have netflix
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.720]   You have hbo showtime
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   um
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.360]   Hulu is owned by the the media companies so
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:29.600]   Uh, that's inside that ownership will change significantly if comcast buys
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.720]   21th 21st 21st century. They will have a 16th
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.560]   They'll have controlling share of hulu. Yes, which is part of the reason they want it
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.600]   And so so there's there's there's actually a fairly limited number of competitors now unless you consider it next week
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.960]   I'll be at vidcon
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.920]   You know
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.040]   10,000 18 year old boys and girls making
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.680]   Shows that have sizable audiences that aren't part of this equation at all
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:57.840]   Um in terms of a huge attention market and people watching, you know game tournaments like you're talking about not part of this
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:05.360]   At all this has always been a problem for for advertisers is reaching the 18 to 25 year old and it's only gotten worse
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:13.040]   Yeah, and uh, and I don't know what advertise, you know the advertising market, which I guess is what's financing all of this
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.640]   Is that right?
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.000]   All are we gonna
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.920]   Well, where you go is everything goes behind a paywall then advertising doesn't matter anymore, right?
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.920]   um
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   Yeah, advertising
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.120]   Not pardon me if we get any of those, but this is where gdpr comes in too
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.680]   Is that the is the less you can target
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:35.440]   The more it's going to be just mass volume, which is awesome for trek. It's awesome for us
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.800]   Because we don't target and it got you know, we just Lisa got off the phone today with you do target
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.440]   No, you do target you are the you are the essence of targeting well only because our programming is niche programming
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:53.840]   Right, but we don't we don't we don't compete well against facebook and google where you can say to google
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.560]   I'd want 18 to 24 year olds to live in hyannis board
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.360]   You can't do that with us
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.720]   And there are advertising. She just got off the phone with a big company
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:10.720]   Big company that won't buy ads because we we won't give them a redirect so they can see who downloads the stuff
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.120]   We won't give them tracking cookies because
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.680]   They this is all stuff they want and they're gonna get they can get from facebook and google
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.360]   And so you you tell me who that is i'll go talk to them
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.040]   I'll set them straight. They're not too far from you
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.160]   uh
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.280]   There
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   So but it's I think it's fascinating
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.240]   Uh, and we're just kind of we're kind of barely keeping our head above water at this point because google and facebook are eating so much of the digital ad spend
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.520]   Because of that targeting now i'm hoping gdpr changes that equation. I really am
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:49.920]   But uh, it's very interesting. Well gdpr is going to extend the life of stupid mass media and yet aren't and yet aren't
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:56.080]   uh brands moving off i heard a few years ago procter and gamble moved off of facebook
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:02.800]   And back to their big tv buys because of what they do they give you something you don't have a relationship with
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.880]   really
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:10.160]   Right. Are you talking about I have a relationship with my charman and your downy
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.440]   And my tide
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.760]   Yeah, that's absolutely true. You have a brand very strong brand relationship, but that's how you're branding advertising is what they want
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.080]   That's what they're just bringing advertising. Yeah
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.760]   And and as product its product introduction, which you're only ever going to be able to do through non targeted
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:36.560]   We you know, we're caught as as a lot of small networks and early cable channels and things are caught in this bad space where ultimately you'd love to be a brand advertising buy
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.360]   But but nobody's going to buy podcasting as a brand advertising. They're always want direct response
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.440]   They was going to want to make sure it somehow and so we're kind of caught somewhere between
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.520]   Deep tracking
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   Direct response and branding but what you'd like is the branding buy so I was talking to a bunch
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:00.000]   Sorry, go ahead. Well, not so I have this community of procto. It's easy you first
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.560]   Never mind go sorry. We don't want to interrupt. Do you see no you we want you easy to talk you go sissy
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.480]   No, I was just gonna say I get a lot of brand advertising for some of some brand advertising
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.200]   For people who are target but again, it's it's kind of niche brand. Do they not always so want a offer code or something?
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.880]   Nope
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.000]   So you'll get advertisements for a company and they say just go to our website
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.480]   They're not go to our website slash stacey and iot
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.640]   And I don't know if it's because they're less sophisticated or they're but they're all happy
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.800]   I mean so notice that the the twit ads that don't have a direct URL are very few
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.640]   Yes, I have noticed that my I offer you get paid
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.320]   We've never seen spaces. No and one of the things I said when we started to is so there's two ways
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.520]   You can sell advertising in in this kind of medium cost
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:47:00.640]   per impression cpm or cost per lead or click and we've more action or action cpa and we've never done cost per action
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.280]   Ad buys actually wait a minute. We did one once Netflix
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.600]   Uh, and it was more an experiment to see what else Netflix would never pay cpm
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.240]   Cpm means they just just like regular tv advertising they pay for the the number of eyeballs
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.600]   uh, they wanted cost per acquisition and
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.720]   Uh, but it was like 50 bucks per acquisition. So he said all right. We'll try it. It did not work well
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.440]   um
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.920]   But but I so but I wanted I always wanted to see I felt like if cost per acquisition devalues your product in my opinion
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.800]   because uh, you know
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:40.000]   You you you're not you're not monetizing people who heard about you but then didn't click the link or whatever
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.680]   You really want to monetize the impressions. I think this is this is the discussion we've had before but I have this community practice
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.560]   I started a cuny with my colleagues there for commerce in news media
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.120]   and um, it's working pretty well now what this is this is this is
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.800]   Sellin stuff off amazon. This is doing deals for heavy blankets. This is this is fairly straightforward
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.840]   But it's something we've never done in news media and and as I as I discussed in the past
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.560]   It needs more trust
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.640]   You know throwing tabula ads in your page. You're obviously telling your readers. You really don't give a damn about
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   Yeah, yeah, we've never did but if you're if you're saying this is the best deal the day I stacey hickenboth and know
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.360]   the best wire
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   Wifi router is not gonna rip you off
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.920]   Uh, I the old apport know the ten best you know you become a wire cutter
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   And and you got to put some investment in that and you got to know that
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.920]   So valuable by the way
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.280]   Yeah, it is and and um, they don't do
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.200]   Advertising I don't think they do they don't really now know
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.960]   Because because it's this is affiliate links. How do they monetize? It's it's both affiliate links
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.080]   They will put up so they're part of the group. They will put up
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.520]   um
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:57.440]   The best they picked the best product then they put up the best links to those products and that's not always the cheapest
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.600]   Right not always the cheapest because it depends on what their users prefer
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.920]   And a lot of users always prefer amazon and amazon the interesting is amazon is as closed and secretive as as with this is with anything
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:15.360]   But they clearly value this channel. So it's the amazon affiliate
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:22.320]   Fees that makes that make them money by the way. Yes. Oh the new york times owns the wire cutter now
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.520]   So the wire cutter. Yes. So when it was bought the rumors were that it was netting about 10 million dollars a year
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:34.640]   And you can gross that up one major online pure play publication. I know of
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.360]   Uh is bringing in
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.400]   100 million a year in in gross not net
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.440]   Gross sales
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:50.160]   Gawker reportedly yeah gawker reportedly what it was last year of life as gawker was grossing again grossing
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.880]   250 million dollars in merchant buy sales
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.920]   And the reason gross is an interesting number is because you have to consider how much it costs them to generate that revenue and so he's
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.080]   Subtractive from the revenue. It's not their profit
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:09.200]   And so something like the wire cutter, which has a lot they have whole they have high costs. I guarantee you because they have a lot of people
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.800]   Yeah, it's but it's an editorial cost it's
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.920]   Against your gross believe me of course
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   Of course
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.000]   We're used to that kind of kind of content costs are used so that's how we're calculating
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.200]   It's just a different kind of advertising in the end right right
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:32.640]   Yeah, but it's also a lower dollar advertise. I would have think but maybe not oh yeah, but but you're not competing for
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.080]   the damned cpm rfps
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.160]   Uh, there's a different relationship with your with your audience what of trust
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.000]   Um, no, it's a very good from the audience point of view
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.360]   Very good. Yeah both of you both of you should be experimenting
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:54.000]   I believe with commerce see what it's like so it's differently oh from because one thing I was saying to the group
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.480]   I said my friend leo the port
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.120]   Right what happens on on the twit network is that every new direct response
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.040]   Um company comes along and says well, i'm gonna try this out on the podcast
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.440]   Casper harries wink all these companies that you've helped launch
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:16.000]   Because you are a great platform for seeing what people respond to at a low cost and low risk
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.760]   They're willing to pay the cpm just because it's not that high it's a small audience
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.080]   They get a lot of data back and you're launching all these companies and then they leave you yeah
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:29.280]   So how do you keep on going value? How do you get to a certain size?
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.240]   Buying tv ads they go on tv right it was hugely expensive
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.320]   Why don't you keep on selling those things we try we try
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.360]   No, because we have no way to do affiliate links. That's a different that's the difference team
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   A podcast and a website. I mean we have an affiliate link program, but we don't make much money on it
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.240]   Yeah
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.800]   It's tough. I see you you could rake it. I would I would follow
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   We are launching
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.680]   You're launching an affiliate link effort
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:09.760]   Um, that is that is coming very soon. Um, the the challenge for me as a journalist old school
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.160]   as an old journalist
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.520]   is
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.040]   Do I is is how we talk to our readers about it? So do I
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.800]   In this is just in the site. This isn't for the podcast
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:30.160]   So how do I do I give them some people give you the option of like here's the affiliate link and here's a non affiliate link for people who really hate that
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.400]   I would somebody do not want to do an affiliate link
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.600]   I don't know I can understand people might say oh you're not going to recommend the best product
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.200]   Just the one that makes you the most affiliate money. That's why you never do that
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.800]   Of course you would but that's why you have to disclose and that's why you build trust relationship
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.080]   But I and I know there are people who say oh, I remember what pint when it was revealed that pinterest
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.520]   Was using affiliate links people were up in arms like
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.640]   Well, but it doesn't cost you anything
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.360]   Right. I don't really understand it
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.920]   But
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.560]   So I think you just disclosed a say you say this is how we
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.440]   We make money through affiliate links
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.960]   If you click this link will be making a few bucks
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.120]   Thank you for your support
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.720]   Any other great thing that wire cutter does is they had a case of a I don't know some kind of coffee maker thing whenever
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.440]   And they recommended the 32 ounce whatever
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.920]   And the audience came back and said no, no, no, no, you're wrong. That one has a problem
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.800]   You actually should recommend the 18 ounce. So that's better for these reasons and wire chemist said oh you're right
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.720]   So we recommend the 18
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.640]   So it's not a you know, you can have a back and forth but because think about both you
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.280]   Guys is that you have really smart audiences that that use this stuff too
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.840]   And that can keep you honest and keep improving the recommendations
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.720]   And I just think it's a it's a little spin-off thing
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:55.120]   Because leo the point is yeah, I think you're right in your normal flow of your media
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.480]   No, but you could start a side brand that is leo recommends. Oh, we've always thought about that
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.560]   We actually did for a while do that
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.360]   I'm right. I'm right. It's a mark has changed. I think jeff
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.680]   I'm bringing this business model into the crowd
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.880]   I'm going in with this business model. I I'm too old to change
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.320]   I like this
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.760]   But Stacy's a young girl. So Stacy I would buy
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.960]   An IOT thing from you and I would pay more you're more in a position to do that frankly than I am
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.840]   Right. We and we do have we do have reviews and that sort of thing. So yes, it makes total sense
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.520]   Which is why we're going to do it. We're just trying to figure out
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.800]   The right way because we did again. We did a review show kind of with that idea in mind
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   But it never our audience is doesn't they don't like that kind of stuff
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.560]   All right, good chunk of your audience is is my audience too. So yay
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.920]   Go spend your money at stacey and IOT. That's where you should spend your money
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:58.480]   But we love our we you know, I really love our model because we can we pick advertisers
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.080]   We like I talk about them. It's a relationship thing, you know, and I have a relationship with the audience
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.240]   We talk about it and I think it's something's good for the eyes
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:12.640]   I love this model if it's not, you know, if if an advertiser says no, yeah, but we've got a track
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:19.440]   And we've got to do this in that fine. They go basically Lisa this morning told that company. Okay fine go somewhere else
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.800]   We don't I was telling I was telling these media people about you
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:28.080]   Right and saying that you do reject advertisers because they're not relevant to your audience because you don't like them
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   Yeah, well, we have trust that's trust. Yeah. Yeah, that's trust. Yeah. I mean, I originally I wanted to make this a paywall
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:42.880]   No seriously from day one. No web 87 16 Leo basically retired. I think people think i'm retired

[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.760]   What kevin tofels telling me he's daft puff

[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.520]   So we don't know it's like dead mouse. He wants to take the night off. He just gives the head to somebody else
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.120]   We don't know
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.280]   What did ninja give his money to that's what I want to know
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.800]   Well, like oh your chat room knows a lot more about this than you do leo they're telling us
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.880]   It's a celebrity tournament where the celeb was paired with a pro player. Oh, I get it
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.520]   It was it's it was the pro am so marshmallow the celebrity
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.840]   Yeah, because ninja really probably did a lot of the work, right
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.200]   Yeah, I don't I don't know. Yeah ninja has uh, the hair
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.800]   That's what color my hair fades to if I don't keep it touched up and just got the blue. I appreciate that you got the blue hair
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   Does ninja get to keep the money and the the and the celebrity gives the money away? Maybe I don't know
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.960]   I was thinking about
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.240]   You should jeff white hair is it's already bleached right? Yeah, it totally would carry color very well
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.400]   I think a 63 year old man with colored hair would be a little weird
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.440]   Uh, I'm a 40 year old woman with colored hair
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.760]   Or we can talk leo into doing it leo if you were gonna pick color for your hair, what would it be?
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   I like my color
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.400]   Remember when we used to talk about yeah, we used to go at chipotle in case uh
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.680]   So ninja tweets you want to know the struggles of streaming over other jobs
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.400]   I left my twitch channel for less than 48 hours and lost 40 000 subscribers
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.720]   Jesus
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.600]   That's that's the other side of this by the way. I was talking about this
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.000]   I'm kfi the other actually I taped it this morning, but it'll be running next week
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.840]   Is that I you know being a celebrity in this new media
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.680]   Is very is you know you have the lifespan of a mayfly? It's very yeah, it's very stressful
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.720]   It's few they work really hard. I think there was a story
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.080]   Is the other day about how many of these youtube stars are just quitting because they're just exhausted
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.120]   They work really hard. They don't make as much money as they ought to for 80 hour weeks
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.720]   And then the ones they're seeing or they go they they the pressure is so great to become more outrageous
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.040]   They go overboard. They like they become like logan paul now when you go to vidcom i'm curious
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.920]   Do you see each year a new crop of stars? Oh, yeah? Yeah, sure so there's quite a bit of turnover
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.960]   Is there anybody is there a tony bennett of?
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.120]   Of the youtube celebrity somebody who's had a long career
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.920]   Pudie pie no
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.440]   Beam what's his name? Casey nice that Casey nice that nice guy
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.280]   Um, what are the two brothers that make the um john and hank green. Oh, yeah, they created
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.680]   They're con yeah, there's Sean medes who became a pop star from his vine career
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.880]   Well, that's the thing I think if you're I think a lot of these guys hope that they or gals can hope them make the transition
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.240]   A mainstream media where you could conceivably have a career
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.160]   um
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   I just I feel like it's um
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.840]   It's a meat grinder for the for the talent it is it's amazing too
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.800]   the the number of because you know when you when you
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.000]   This year for the first time my daughter can't go with me because she's got a job
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.480]   um, you want mine, but
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.720]   I bet she'd love to go and she yeah
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.560]   Yeah, i'm telling you stacey. It's the thing you do you really it's a joy
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.800]   It's an amazing conference and your daughter would go crazy. Yes. It would be a great mother daughter thing to do
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.240]   I'm telling you this but you will thank me. It's it's it's amazing
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.320]   But they they do raffle they do drawings and you get like for the registration you get three or four
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.840]   Um, I would call them signings, but of course nobody signs anything anymore because maklouin says it's dead
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.480]   Um, but selfie opportunities. That's what you do now instead of autographs. You do selfies. Yeah. Yeah, and and it's
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.840]   It's phenomenal how many there are which is to say how many people have an audience sufficient
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.480]   To want to sign up and wait in line
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.360]   Um to be able to do that. It's it's
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.840]   Casey ny stat
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.200]   Who by the way sold beam to cnn for and then failed there failed and he had
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.600]   Failed with it as he's back on his own, but he's got his money
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.040]   I doubt he gave the money back three and a 3.1 million followers on instagram
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.080]   Yeah, and the link goes to shop casey ny stat.com where he's got merch
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:36.560]   Well, not a lot of merch you see i didn't minus n. Oh, isn't that funny the last that is for cn star
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.040]   No money. Yeah, no money
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.480]   Work harder is the back of that t-shirt. Oh, so I take it back. I thought he maybe had this big merch thing
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.800]   He's got one lousy sweatshirt. Casey you're slacking off
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.520]   Do you think he makes a lot of money on youtube?
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.360]   Yeah, he probably made enough money with the cnn deal that he doesn't the money is less of a concern
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.680]   I would know who's the great um the therapist, uh, who's on the woman?
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.520]   Oh
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520]   She's wonderful. You two therapists
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.000]   Well, yeah, oh, yeah, you know, she's spectacular every every year at my favorite session at vidcon
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.880]   is um
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.720]   mental health
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.400]   and you have
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.120]   Youtubers who have talked about their addiction and their and their depression and their anxiety
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.680]   Uh up there on stage talking about you have 300 being the young women in the audience sharing this with them the empathy is thick
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.840]   It's phenomenal, but that that panel is always
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   Moderated by Katie morton. Thank you. Katie morton and kitty morton is just great. Um, she's a licensed
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.960]   Psychotherapist. Yep. Yep, and she she has tremendous loyalty
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:53.040]   Um, oh, then there's no wait a minute because she only has 205,000 subscribers. So you're kidding really? Yeah, so she's well
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.760]   No, well now 351 but still not millions
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.600]   So and 12,000 views 20,000 views. Oh, so right?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   This gets into the
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:11.040]   Subscribers maybe aren't everything. I mean, well, they are if you're trying to monetize your youtube monetize now
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.720]   She has a patreon. That's how let's see how many people on the patreon votes you
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.520]   Yeah, let's see on the patreon about
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.200]   My drunk kitchen. What's your name? Um, my drunk kitchen
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.360]   So she's only got 535 patrons on the patreon. So that's not a big that's not a big bunch of money
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.680]   She's working hard and she probably still has her day job. I hate to say
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   Um, a hand of heart hand of heart
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.720]   She's a big one too. Hannah heart
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.520]   H. A. R. T. My heart drunk kitchen. Oh, yeah, I think I saw her with iJustine now
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:48.800]   She's got 2.3 2.5 million subscribers. Yeah, she's bigger. Yeah, does she get drunk and cooked and she and she crossed over
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.760]   She did a show for like the food network or something. Yeah
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.880]   She also has had a talk to a friend about suicide
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.680]   Yes, she's also very good. She's really good
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.800]   There's there's a there's a lot of awareness now about mental health on youtube. I think that that's been something
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.520]   I think you could say it's clearly that
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.480]   Had a little digital side has pushed that into mainstream
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:13.440]   It really has we had we had many of you remember we had a phenomenal end to the show
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.840]   Uh, I guess three weeks ago with with um aunt and uh, Kevin at pruett and kevin toffle
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:27.120]   Yeah, both talking about about uh aunt his wife's depression. He was very open about him talking about it and kevin about his own and and I I had
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.640]   exchanges with one email afterwards. I'm just so grateful for the courage that they showed
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.560]   In doing that that taking away the stigma. This is a phenomenal
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.120]   medium an opportunity for that
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.600]   For people to know they're not alone. Uh, you know, we've all been crushed by the recent celebrity suicides
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.200]   Um, and and so yeah, so the fact that had a heart
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:54.640]   Uh, we'll talk about that openly is amazing. I also put on the rundown down at the bottom. Um, will uh, will we?
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:00.000]   Yeah, wrote it gave a speech for the text of his speech about his depression and anxiety, which was
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.240]   Very touching and brave as well. Well, what's interesting?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.280]   You did it because of jenny lassen
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:15.360]   The blog is she helped prompt him to start talking more openly about it. Oh, I love I love the blog. Yes. Yes
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:23.600]   Yeah, and she's clearly got mental health issues. I'm sorry. That's not nice to say but she's very she's you could tell when you she's
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   Funny because she's in pain
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.680]   Is that reasonable to say that?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.360]   Yes, it's a better way to say it than you originally said it. Yes. Oh, believe me. I have mental health issues
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.880]   It's not it's I have no stigma. Believe me. No stigma at all
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.120]   Uh, I fact more more and more. I think we all do I really do
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:50.800]   Um, so but it's great when these people are coming over. Oh, the blog. Yes, you don't know jenny lassen. Oh my god, oh, she's
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.440]   I'm dara. Oh, but you know, it's I guess what I'm when I'm saying in my
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.600]   Injustification is like many comics
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.680]   A lot of comedy seems to come out of pain personal pain, right? Oh, yeah
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.160]   But it's not just comics. It's everybody that's really yeah
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.440]   Uh different topic. This is a little bit of uh, kind of breaking
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.640]   So facebook promised to
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.960]   Label political ads and to reveal who bought them, right? Which everybody said? Yeah, it last right? Yes
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.360]   Well, when I was out at f eight, I I quickly saw they were wrestling that and they've been wrestling ever since
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.640]   Uh oh, so when the new york times
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.080]   Advertises their coverage of a topic
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.800]   The effort to scale this made facebook want to say political ad
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.880]   New york times has a s bit
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.360]   That's another publishers do too. Oh, but facebook kind of didn't know what to do about this
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:52.560]   So they just announced just as well. Definitely started the on the air. They changed their policy
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.880]   so now
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.360]   A couple things one that they're gonna they're their label is going to be paid for by which is great
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.080]   Which should be on every ad alive every ad everywhere should have who paid for this?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.320]   I agree. I agree and then be they're gonna have to figure out how to how to segregate political stuff from
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.240]   News and that's actually harder than it sounds
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.920]   Well, wait a minute scale because the new york times is not paying for that article on facebook
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.160]   Oh, no, no, no, the new york times does pay for things that was the point
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.360]   The new york times does pay to promote its coverage nik christoff
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.600]   Covering it's always hasn't it always said that paid paid promotion or something
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.840]   On facebook
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.680]   But now it had to say political ad
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.520]   Oh, they also required that you had to like give your passport to say who it was improve
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.200]   You're an American citizen buying this ad that's not political ad that's journalism
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.840]   What that's their dream is driving
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.800]   They're in the problem
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.440]   But it isn't a political ad it's journalism. I know
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:56.800]   Wait though because some of their editorials I would argue our political ads almost
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.960]   I would not call what they're doing. I would not call the editorial pages of
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.200]   Newspapers journalism. I think that's actually a really important distinction
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.440]   Maybe you need multiple distinctions here in
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.680]   If you're nik christoff and you have a pub opinion piece in the new york times the new york times promotes it on facebook
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.400]   It doesn't need to be
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:22.400]   It doesn't need to be billed as a political ad paid for by the new york times. It doesn't make any sense at all
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:29.840]   All right, so a lot of writing a lot of writing has point of view that doesn't make it political advertising
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.080]   Well, so like when agit pai writes something in the wall street journal is that political or is that
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.560]   Not if the journal publishes it no
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.520]   If agit pai writes an article that says you should vote for candidate x
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.240]   That might be there's more to politics, especially in today's voting
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.160]   Yeah, which is don't forget what the russians did they went after issues like race. Yeah, you got to be careful
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.120]   Because if you start billing everything as political advertising then it means nothing
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.160]   I couldn't read more and that's what they're that's what they're facing and that's what they realized
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.760]   The world pushed them to a solution. They said, okay, okay, okay
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:13.040]   Well, they will political ads then the way they wanted to do that was to say if you if your ad bought ad is about
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:19.840]   All these things that's political. Yeah, well, if it's about coverage of that thing. That's that's one remove
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.080]   Um and and they didn't know what to do with it and and they went through
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   uh about two months of the publishers just screeching
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.680]   And and I get it. I think the publishers are right to screech
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.160]   Uh because this why we're here with you leo. This is absurd, but they didn't know how to do it
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.880]   So this is this is the world that we're in now
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.600]   It's just fascinating to see these things that you wouldn't have expected would have caused headaches caused real headaches
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:50.080]   So that that that change came out just I think we can find a definition of political advertising that does not include
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.720]   op ad to pieces
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.880]   But well stay seated disagrees with you
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.640]   I do I might write an op-ed about it
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   Do we want to talk about uh, google because I have a question for you
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.560]   There's a difference there's a difference between political speech and political ads
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.880]   Oh, okay. Yes
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.120]   Yeah, political speech
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.760]   But if you make an advertise
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.600]   Speech no, but they're not making that that's the New York times buying promotion for the New York times
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:32.160]   That's not that's indirect by a by a direction of one. That's not the same thing as a paid political ad
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.240]   I think that that I agree, but that wasn't easy to do. Well, I just did it
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.680]   Well, you have to have a list. The problem is this you have to have a list of
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.320]   Who is a legitimate?
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.560]   New York is not I'm actually working on a project. You're right. I guess if bright part
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.040]   broad bingo
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.680]   uh, promotion for a bright bar editorial
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.920]   supporting
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   Anybody but mark sandford
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.520]   Right that would kind of count like a political ad. All right, even though they call themselves a publisher a news publisher
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.720]   No, their agenda is clear their agenda is proper. Yeah, I feel like there's political speech. There's advertising
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:16.800]   There's promotional advertising for content. That should not be political. That should not I think it's it's it's worth
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.960]   Maybe there's some gray areas getting through
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.800]   To being very clear that this was an ad purchased by
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.880]   Organization
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.360]   X to promote candidate y that should be billed. What about
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.560]   purchased by
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:41.520]   A plan parenthood
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:48.400]   Uh and the and the and the and the ad pushes the agenda
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.160]   His plan parenthood's not a not a journalistic entity. No, no, but is that a political ad? Yeah
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.880]   Okay
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.400]   What if a and richard's rights a okay, she's dead uh seseal richard's rights a
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.280]   It's a miracle
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:12.480]   Op-ed op-eds no op-eds never a political ad that's just a political speech. Okay political speech is protected
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.280]   That's the other thing you're gonna have a very hard time
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.640]   Well, they're not saying that it's not I mean they're they're not saying they're not gonna run it
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.080]   They're just saying they want to label it right? I don't it's right. I mean, okay
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:29.680]   That's like those people who argue that their free speech is being violated when they get fired for being a jerk on the job
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.160]   Does it dilute uh the value of those labels if you put it on too many things, maybe not
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.280]   That's well, that's part of the question too. Yeah, maybe so so at the root of this
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.160]   So i'm about to start working a project. We're gonna talk about it now because i'm going forever
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.640]   But another we come happy to
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.200]   that looks at
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.120]   What is quality news you have to start with what's news you have to look at the signals of quality and i'm not saying there's one size fits all of all
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.400]   Uh, but those are discrete issues
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.600]   Coming up, we're gonna talk about google
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.680]   Stacey promise do we have to stay see do we have
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.680]   I just have one question
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.680]   It's it's a burning question. So hold on
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.360]   A little longer because I got it. He's gonna burr
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   I got it to an ad for
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.440]   Ties meant
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.880]   So hold that burning thought while we talk a little bit about
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.760]   a publishing platform
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.080]   A place for you to make your space on the web
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:33.120]   A way for businesses to reach customers a way for businesses to sell to customers. Yes all that in one
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:41.920]   Fabulous bundle i'm talking about wordpress.com. It's where my uh, website lives leola port.com pretty much everybody
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.960]   I know
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:49.680]   Has a wordpress site actually 30 percent of the entire world wide web is on wordpress that that's kind of a stunning statistic
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.160]   It's because it's so good
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.680]   Where if you visited my site, you know that this is the most it's the center of me online, right?
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.920]   Uh, and everybody ought to have this if you've got a high schooler
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.520]   First thing to do set them up with a website get their domain name
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.360]   Get them online so that they control their reputation online because they they have this website
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.840]   My daughter's doing this. She's putting her best stuff up there portfolio her resume
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.320]   Uh, her poetry her art because she wants to have a presence online your facebook page is not it
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.920]   You don't own that your twitter feed. That's not it either. You don't own that you own your website at wordpress.com
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.880]   And wordpress makes it easy. I mean you're not there some people are there maybe to learn web technologies
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.280]   And certainly if you're into html and java script and css you could do all of that
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.040]   But you don't need to you don't need to do the coding you don't need to design wordpress
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.320]   Has great templates great designs really state-of-the-art stuff so you get your site up and running like that
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.720]   You focus on the content they'll handle all the rest of it and if you ever have a question
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.480]   I had a quite I was looking for a template that is certain things
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.600]   Customer support teams there all day and all night on monday through friday. They're even there on weekends
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:06.000]   I asked them a question. They suggested a template and I was very gratified because abby chose completely independently exactly the same template
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.520]   For her website 2017. I thought great minds
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.200]   WordPress also offers powerful e-commerce options my son
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.280]   As well. I you know I don't want to put my pictures. He's a avid amateur photographer
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.760]   I don't want to put him on facebook. They get squeezed too much quality's too low
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.960]   I said face it you got it you facebook's terrible. You got to go to wordpress.com
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.080]   And so he's going to set up his site at wordpress.com
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   And their e-commerce options are perfect
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.000]   You have a simple and effective buy button on the photo or you can have a complete online store
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.400]   Casey nice that pay attention plans started just four dollars a month

[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.360]   You wanted to talk about google here's your chance
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.520]   I
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:33.600]   I wanted to ask because I've seen a lot of news coverage here about google giving people three
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   Things they can say on the google home
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.760]   Kevin and I both tried it this morning and then google pulled that tweet
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.960]   We tried it this morning and it wasn't working for us. So I was curious if it's working for anyone else
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   I don't even understand what it is. So basically you can give google three
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.080]   consecutive commands so tell me the weather in
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.720]   London, Houston and Austin
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.520]   and it's supposed to work but
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.920]   It has so far not worked for me. I tried it with weather. I tried it with lights
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.520]   I
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.880]   Tried it with some other stuff and nothing so I can do two which was the old default
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.920]   So if anyone else tell me what temperature it is in Austin
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:16.160]   LeBron james height and the length of the london bridge
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.880]   Nope
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.800]   Okay, yeah, everyone's like 50 places in roamed florence and venice
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:31.840]   I got I got completely garbage results on that one
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   holy cow
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.720]   So is it easier if I say them related
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:41.600]   What is the temperature in Austin Houston and dallas?
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:48.800]   Um, it gave me search results
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.400]   But the result I got was is dallas normally hotter than austin or san antonia. I mean
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.280]   I don't know is it
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.160]   Uh, austin at the highest number of days of the temperature exceeded the highs so austin is you're leaving the hottest spot
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.480]   Number sixteenth in the u.s for hottest summertime weather
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:13.120]   Yay, yeah, so they pulled that tweet so I guess not yet
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.840]   I was just wondering because some people were like I can do it and i'm like really
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   But okay, that's it. That was my only google related thing that I was like just oh we got a little stuff
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.720]   Oh, we got tons of little stuff. I'm just yeah, I'm just
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.560]   I had heard about that as of this reading google seems to have deleted the original tweet so
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.560]   Oh apparently it only works in france
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:38.240]   What no
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.600]   I don't know. I don't know was that the
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.280]   Amazon echo wired actually did a good story on
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.520]   Inside amazon's painstaking pursuit to teach alexa french
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.560]   And it was actually a pretty good story. That's got to be hard
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   Uh, yeah
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.840]   Yeah, the too long didn't read version is it's hard
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.200]   It's hard
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.920]   Um
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.080]   You'll love this one jeff murdock based
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.520]   backed tech startup sinks into
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:19.200]   bankruptcy saying it had been crushed by google
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.320]   unlocked an astralian advertising
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:29.280]   Or not an advertising startup and google wouldn't put it in the play store saying that it uh violated the rules
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.520]   So there you go
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   I don't think it takes google to kill a startup. They're pretty weak they're weaklings
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.800]   Um
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.560]   Facebook bug sets 14 million users sharing settings to public
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.360]   ah
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.440]   They fixed it
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.240]   Um, why do what about the pixel three leaks? Should I trust those?
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.120]   Uh, I guess what would you do? What would you do with that information if it were real?
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.320]   Uh literally nothing
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.800]   So so I have trust them then
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.960]   One my us one my international. I left the international in the plane. Oh jeff
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.840]   So which plane which airline?
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.760]   I united so I went down I went I drove I would discover a week later. I thought it was my briefcase opus is not there
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.200]   So it was god knows where it's got around the world or wherever it's someplace else
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.120]   So I go in I'm driving to work. I go by do her carport. I go in and lost and found
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.800]   Oh, dad. Oh, that woman comes out very nice woman. She says I got a lot of these samsungite phones
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.840]   I can't find one. I didn't know google ones
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.040]   So that they're all samsung samsung
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.200]   I wouldn't trust that
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.840]   Do you have are you running like tile or something on it?
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.880]   No, I run, you know, you could do the android thing, but it's only if it's all on we'll tell you where it is
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.280]   Yeah, I used that the other day because I couldn't find my pixel two
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.000]   and I looked for two days and
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.960]   It has fallen down a crack in the bed and I found it
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:05.120]   With the find my phone, which was great and it had stopped 23 28 percent, but you're right as soon as the battery's dead
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.000]   You're out of luck. So you got it's gone. So look at a couple of days jake hell on my old phone
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.480]   So I mean he's is I got to tell him even on friday
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.000]   So having a FedEx it to me. I just got a new fight chip
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.960]   Well, the good news is why has expanded
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.320]   Uh to other phones you can actually get them fairly inexpensive
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.520]   Uh, one of them with 199 though. This is a new gambit
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.440]   So I just looked that up the moto g6 is 199. Yeah on best buy
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.240]   199 if you active is unlocked
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.040]   199 if you activate today
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.280]   249 if you don't so it's really unlocked at 249 and yeah
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.840]   That's rude. So what is google? That's rude. That's rude
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.480]   How rude
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.000]   A wood so what is google selling? They're selling uh
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:01.360]   Oh, I thought pixels moto g6 and right one moto x4 now g7 not anymore
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.240]   What do you mean? They must have sold out. I'm looking at the google store. There's just pixels now
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.960]   Oh, no, but if you go to if you go google phi
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.240]   Oh, you have to do it through phi if you go to phi
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.960]   Let me try to see if I can buy the moto g6
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.560]   The g6 is a great phone. I mean it's cheap, but it's certainly good enough for your uh
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.520]   You know, you're yes, you can buy the moto g6
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.920]   199 for 24 months. Oh, no one on the hour or eight or eight 29 months forever once
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.080]   Uh with five
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   Well, what that's what you want phi, right?
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.760]   Yeah, I'm just gonna get my my old phone comes back from jake that i'll use that
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.880]   Or I said go to best buy and buy the most g7 is very nice. I wouldn't get the v35
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.160]   It's kind of I think kind of big and clunky
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:52.960]   Uh the g7 is really expensive coming soon coming soon the two all g's. Yeah
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.800]   The moto x4
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800]   Or is it bad?
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.200]   Yeah, it's got it ends cut better battery life. That's an android one phone. It is really? Yeah, that's what this is
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.120]   I don't know that that's interesting. Huh
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.800]   But you you use it mostly as a phone, right
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.360]   Well internationally I use it for uh, I just all my data
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.000]   I mean mapping and all that stuff so I don't get ripped off and
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.800]   Uh for tethering now is probably a good time to get a pixel to excel. They're taking 150 bucks off
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.160]   So it's 700 bucks, but this is back to stacey's point finally
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.720]   So what do I do this information? What the the pixel three is I anticipate getting the pixel three
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.680]   So i'm not gonna spend too much money now. Yeah, that's a good point
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.520]   And that will be that way i'll go though become my backup international phone, right?
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.320]   So, what do you think october? Yeah
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.440]   October that's when they usually come out after our way to announcement
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:49.280]   Oh, did you see the google translate things you can download? That's pretty cool. So offline google translate. Oh, tell me about that
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.040]   Yeah google google this sucker
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.360]   Um, I think it's like 59 languages. You can download
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.840]   To your device so you can just do translate even when you don't have a cloud connection. That is great. Wow
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:09.920]   So i have to say having used both google translate and micro sauce being translate. I like the being translator a little bit better
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.000]   They have that instantaneously too. Don't they? Yeah, it's offline as well
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.320]   The bing doesn't work well. But the bing is what what twitter uses. It's not as good to my mind
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.880]   Uh, well, that's not the speech translation though. I don't know. Oh, I see I see
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   This is nice. So offline neural machine translations for 59 languages
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.680]   Yeah, they just say
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.400]   Wait when I worked at the services code examiner
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.000]   We we used a cms called sii systems integrators
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.760]   And they had a standalone terminal. I'm gonna get to a point believe it or not
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:49.360]   Where it was just considered the most wokstar amazing coding that somebody managed to get hyphenation and justification
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.360]   Onto the terminal locally. This was just phenomenal
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:28:01.200]   That you could do that right and now you consider you could store 59 languages and translation and all your problem your phone your pike
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.280]   It's come a long way babies. Yeah. Yep
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.120]   And by the way, you still can't do hyphenization on
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.720]   Device
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.200]   Maybe that was just a hard
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.960]   So facepo's they're hard hyphens are hard
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.000]   Hyphens are very hard
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.800]   Uh facebook memories and yeah
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.280]   Fire tv cube. I did order one of these. This is going to be interesting
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.280]   Amazon has announced this thing with infrared coming out of all the sides
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.960]   So you put this in your
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Your cabinet with all your other gear for your tv and it can control them with the voice with the echo
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:51.200]   So now does this control things like your uh, uh, uh, what's the word that i'm looking for your tv box your cable box?
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:55.280]   Your roku your cable box everywhere everything
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.920]   So the idea is it's uh kind of like what logitech does
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.840]   Receiving yes anything you can turn on off or on with your infrared remote
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:12.240]   And uh now i'm gonna get one because I have a lot of experience with large logitech's universal remotes
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.880]   And one of the things logitech has going forward is they have an online site
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:22.320]   Where you that knows about every kind of brand or receiver and everything so this is going to compete heavily then with the logitech harmony. Yes
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.560]   Yes
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.800]   If it's good, it's as easy to configure and that's going to be the real test harmonies been around for years
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.960]   So logitech is easy to configure. Yeah, it's a massive database and you just go online
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.480]   And you say if you want to watch, you know, a world cup soccer
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.120]   You have to turn on the satellite dish you have to turn on the receiver. You have to go to hdmi one
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.360]   You turn on the tv
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.000]   Go to ch uh use the go set the cable box to
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.720]   I mean you have to do all of that stuff and then it will show up
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.360]   If and if it can do that man, that's gonna be anyway, I have one in order it should be uh, uh,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.440]   It's on your butts
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.480]   Sagan
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.760]   How much is it?
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.920]   Well, right now it's 120 bucks
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.640]   If you if you've ordered it right away
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:08.240]   90 bucks for prime members, but just in the first two days, so that's why I ordered immediately
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.600]   Okay, well, let me know because I will let you know although harmony does harmonies
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.080]   100 bucks and it works with google yeah, and it's great. So
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.440]   I don't know how how good is the google integration for you?
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:25.760]   Uh the google harmony integrations terrible. I had to create my own routine. That's right
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:31.040]   Because it's it's where you're like google ask harmony to do something and then a separate voice is like hello
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.200]   I'm harmony. How can I help you?
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.520]   Well, you're like shut up turn on my television considering this comes from amazon
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.480]   I'm hoping that that'll be a little bit better a little tighter integration
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.640]   Do you have your uh fire tv do you have a fire tv? I'd be curious how it compares to a fire tv
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.200]   It is a fire tv
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:55.760]   Okay, that will then the same experience. Okay. Yeah, it is basically a fire tv with his additional remote stuff
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.560]   Got it
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.520]   Oh, this is great. We're just whipping through this stuff
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.680]   content or
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.200]   content oh
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.080]   Content aren't you glad you don't live in Tanzania?
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.280]   Yeah, we have a story about Tanzania. We do
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.000]   Where is the Tanzania story?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.360]   And irritating angry. I will tell you everything you need to know right now. Stay safe and bathroom. Oh, okay. Oh, oh, I see it
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.520]   Dar es salam. I've always wanted to say that Tanzania
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.040]   Dateline dara salam ordered on
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:38.320]   Tanzania has ordered all unregistered bloggers and online forums to suspend immediately or face criminal prosecution
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.080]   and the cost of registering your blog
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:50.320]   $900 for a license which is an interesting number since that's also the number of per capita annual income
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.720]   in Tanzania
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.880]   So a year's salary to run a blog
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.440]   Otherwise they're coming for you
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.960]   digital activists say the law is part of a crackdown and dissent and free speech
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:08.480]   by the president john magufuli who was elected in 2015
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.520]   government officials and this should be
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.360]   Pay attention
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.160]   The justification the government gives is no we're tackling hate speech
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:25.840]   cyberbullying and pornography this is going to be used as an excuse for everything same same thing as going after a sex trade
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.560]   Luffed us without a section 230 exactly
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:32.080]   Exactly
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.160]   June 15th last actually that starting from june 11th
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.280]   prohibited for posting any new content
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.800]   And you must be licensed by june 15th or they're coming for you
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:48.880]   This is this is how they do it folks. Just so you know, it's a good, you know, good thing to be aware of
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.840]   The fine 22 as at least 22 not minimum of $2200
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.800]   imprisonment for minimum of 12 months or both
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:01.520]   Jesus immediately of course, uh, some forms of shutdown
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:10.640]   I didn't know there was a group called reporters without borders. Oh, yes
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.840]   And they said they're very good kill off the blogosphere in tansanilla
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:19.920]   And I think a lot of people say well big deal. What do we need blogs for?
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:26.640]   Uh, pre speech in places where the government, uh controls the news right organizations, right?
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.680]   And here's some good news
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:37.440]   Podcast ad revenues hit 314 million dollars in 2017. So who got the other 14 million? Well?
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.920]   It wasn't me that's up by the way 86 percent from 2016 but I gotta tell you this
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:53.200]   The number last year was wrong. I don't know how close this is to accurate. This is done by the iab
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.680]   You actually have a a
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.480]   Impressive percentage of that really well
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:03.200]   Last year when they said it was um 169 million
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.520]   We had 10 million of that and I thought well, there's got to be more than 16 of us
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.440]   Yeah
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.280]   but um, I you know
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:18.880]   Anyway, I think that that number is tough because podcasters don't all belong to the iab. It's very expensive
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.040]   No, oh, I don't belong to the iab right. I don't belong to the iab
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.440]   Why would you?
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.360]   Um because i'll tell you why we've looked at it, but it's really expensive
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.360]   I I don't care where it's gonna cost but we're gonna do it because we want representation
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.000]   Because the iab unfortunately is the interactive advertising bureau
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.120]   It's equivalent of the rab for radio and what is the magazine version of this? Um the um
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:53.440]   It's similar, but the idea it's the cab I think but it's the same idea which is circulation ad bureau or something like that
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.320]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's it's the idea is it's really advertisers that put this together
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.600]   And so a lot of advertising agencies use iab
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.800]   boilerplate contracts and standards
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.680]   and uh
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.920]   many of the terms in the iab contracts are death to podcasters
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:18.640]   uh, so uh, we don't accept iab contracts we um amend them
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.760]   So we want to understand why you were joined
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.120]   So you can argue in way in and say look this is you got to understand this is not acceptable
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.080]   If we can't do this and then also so that these numbers become a little bit more accurate
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.160]   Uh host red ads were the most heavily used ad type
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.800]   Two-thirds of all ads in 2017. I'm going to take credit for actually bringing that you you bloody well should yes
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.040]   direct response
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.560]   You know leo you know leo
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.800]   This is like an hour's turn right now. He has a fit about the uh the broadcasting hall of fame
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.760]   There should be a podcast hall of fame and you should be the first person and I was there is yeah
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.880]   Oh, well then good. There's justice. I got a trophy in the other room
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.040]   there's
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.600]   There's a shack somewhere in and de boin
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.640]   There is the folks at podcast pickle put it together
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.800]   Oh, yeah, so you're in the you're in the pod is how was in the I was in the anne they inaugural year
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.880]   Yeah, well, that's justice that's along with appropriately adam curry
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.240]   Right and I don't remember who else maybe um
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.560]   I don't know. I think mark marin is in there adam corolla
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.560]   Dave whiner should be he really created the code that made it possible
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.920]   Uh host red ads a direct response ads. We're just talking about this
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.440]   Transacted on a cost per thousand basis majority of campaigns brand awareness ads 29
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:40.560]   That's actually that's very good
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.080]   Oh lord. I don't know any of the current inductees
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:49.520]   Into the podcast hall of fame. Yes. Yeah, I can be a podcast so it happens

[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:08.880]   It's not like the rock and roll hall of fame where you've got a deep list of people or or the baseball hall of fame
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.520]   a deep list of people uh ready
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:17.200]   And willing to assume the role but heath and the girl have been doing they deserve it. They long time. I don't know dave

[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.200]   Um and still like them now this so this is that's the story I wrote two years ago
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.440]   So you actually need the verge story, which is below it. It's talking about the $60 fee. Yeah
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:18.560]   So, uh, I use plume along with euro in my house. I've spent a lot of money. I have 12 plume units
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:25.360]   Dear god. Well, you're supposed to put one in every room. I mean it really is a sponsor or was they are not euro is a sponsor
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.520]   uh
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.800]   the
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.640]   Now remember plume took a big investment from our favorite company
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.520]   Comcast
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.000]   And when you get xphinities wifi solution you get plume pods to extend it
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.080]   Uh, the only if you need to extend it. Yes, and you actually have to purchase them. Oh, you don't get them you buy them
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.600]   Uh, yes
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:53.360]   So you have crappy wifi you call them up you complain and they're like I can offer you this for I don't know how much it is 39 bucks
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.160]   I think plume has added a new router a three tri band bigger router than the little ones
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:03.360]   Uh, I'll probably buy that but you have to pay 60 bucks a year to keep it active and this is the thing that's most offensive
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.840]   If you don't pay the subscription it stops working
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.800]   Well, so if you pay the subscription
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.240]   You buy the three pack for 40 bucks you get a deal. Yeah, right so
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.520]   You basically so the original is 180
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.200]   So 40 plus 120 gets you to basically two years two three years
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.640]   But on year three if you don't pay they brick that hardware, which I think they should not do
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.560]   I do think that they're justified and charging euro has a
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.080]   optional subscription service for additional features
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:41.520]   I don't understand why this is not like you put your whole like your old-fashioned router
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.400]   Where you buy it you plug it in and you're done
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.240]   But all of these new mesh services are uh are constantly
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.040]   updating with firmware and they claim
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:57.040]   Constantly modifying their behavior to adjust to your network and it's like crow book
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.800]   Okay, okay. Hold on you guys. Let's talk about this for a little bit
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:06.000]   So what plume offers is slightly different than what euro and some other guys offer
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.040]   All of their intelligence and all of their routing
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:15.760]   Happens in the cloud so they are actually constantly pulling data for these things about the devices trying to connect
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.720]   And the state of your network and they're optimizing that literally on the fly. So
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.600]   Think about that. Um, so
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:29.840]   They're also even like laptop had new printer drivers. Well, you also get
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.840]   Paretta controls you get additional security features
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:39.600]   Um, there's additional there's stuff you're getting that you would subs you could conceivably subscribe to from
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:46.880]   Stacy you go and you could still get that from you know, euro offers a subscription the challenge for a company like plume is
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.480]   They're actually making a very different case. They're trying to take Wi-Fi and turn it into
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.880]   More of a service and this has always been their case, which is why two years ago
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.880]   I was like, oh hey, they're gonna charge people for this because I knew that was where they wanted to go
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.480]   They're actually licensing their stuff to isp's like Comcast
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.960]   So they're software that runs in the cloud and on these edge devices
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:15.680]   That's that's a continually running and updated service. It's not like i'm pushing out an update
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.120]   The service is delivered via the cloud constantly. So that's one. So your network
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.960]   Changes like moment by moment two
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.880]   They're their big market isn't into consumers
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:36.480]   Their big market is selling to isp's and to selling to having other companies that make Wi-Fi hub type devices
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.720]   Put their software inside their devices. So they have a deal with samson
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.400]   And the theory is eventually samson is going to put this software
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.320]   into
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:51.840]   Anything that has not anything but anything that has enough processing power and Wi-Fi and help create these like
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:59.600]   Mesh networks around your home using other things are harder. That's interesting. Yes. Yeah, so
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.920]   That's
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.320]   The goal and I would also say
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:09.760]   This gives you and i'm not against this because I think it gives you
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.520]   More certainty that you're going to need in today's era of
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:19.520]   Lots of devices running in your home. It gives you a lot more security because you can if i'm paying 60 bucks
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.680]   They darn well better give me a security update on every vulnerability ASAP
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.960]   I think for most of your audience leo they're going to hate this because they're smart enough and they they deal with their own stuff
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.360]   But like a common normal person
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.120]   Paying 60 bucks a month to have guaranteed awesome Wi-Fi
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320]   Uh, sorry a year. Sorry five dollars
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:48.320]   Six wait six dollars. Well, what's interesting is the website has kind of changed the language and now says not by plume but join plume
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:54.400]   Yeah, they're really acting like you're you're really subscribing to a service that happens to have some associated hardware
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:58.640]   Now as a existing plume guy, I don't think I have to worry about this right i'm grand
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.280]   No, somebody said oh really i thought one of the stories said you're they changed
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.840]   They got clued the verge originally reported
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.840]   That in there they came back with clarification the verge was like, oh, okay
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:16.080]   So the virtue one of the many things I hated my cable company for before I got Verizon was that they rented me the damn
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:19.120]   Yeah, right and and forever
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.160]   And and long after I paid him off for it
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.880]   Right, so we finally got freed from that just like the old telephone. We had to pay rent our telephones
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.760]   This is something consumers have had to do, but they hate
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:32.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's just it's kind of
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.640]   Motor fees
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.240]   Are 11 bucks a month, right? But you know what?
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.000]   People paid for it people continually pay for it a lot of people do not go either
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.720]   No, and it's not the AOL people it's normal people who just are like, eh screw it. It's all part of that
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.840]   I mean, I know we in the tech press gets so aggravated by it, but
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:59.760]   You know, most people don't think about it. So
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.520]   I pay for the kind of awful money bottle. Isn't it? No, I don't think so
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:12.480]   I think it's just because your expectations are conditioned by what a router used to be. This is a different thing now
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.560]   Think about your link sis or TP link router somebody in the chat room was like saying isn't this like it's a half-baked product
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.720]   And I say no because they're continually like routers are continually being targeted now as
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:30.800]   Great devices to hack and they're what could be the vulnerabilities are like everywhere
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.280]   So having somebody who's willing to
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.240]   Upgrade that and do it very proactively. I think is a really important thing that
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240]   I probably won't pay for
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.760]   Plume service because that's my iot network. It's a separate network from the euro
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:56.640]   But I do pay for euro plus which is a similarly priced product that gives you all sorts of additional security services
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.200]   It's kind of like open DNS and and services like that. So
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.440]   I think euro plus is 20 euro plus is $10 a month. Is it?
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.200]   Yeah, so it's actually it's it's twice that
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.600]   Um, let me make sure before I say that
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:17.920]   Because I I looked at buying it and I was gonna buy it and they have one password and vpn services as part of it
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.920]   So has encrypt me one password malware bites you get advanced security
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.600]   Prevent yes
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.760]   Month malicious content or viruses you get ad blocking
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.880]   So that's network wide ad blocking
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.560]   Uh, you have family filtering which means I can have filters for my kid that are more
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.440]   Wait a second wait a second it blocks ads coming through the router
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.640]   Yeah to to the web prevent most ads from appearing on your mobile phone desktop and other connected services
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.960]   That sounds like I can oh as a publisher. Of course. I hate that's a copyright violation. It's awful. It's
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.840]   It ain't that neutrality
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:56.640]   It's for damn sure
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.280]   No
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.280]   starving journalist leo
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:07.600]   Uh, they uh, basically get a vpn service. So I think for what you get that's not an unreasonable amount of money
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:13.200]   But uh, and I think again, it's gonna really come down to what do you get with plume?
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.680]   And is it are you getting what you're paying for? Is it something worth
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.080]   Why yeah, I mean probably is you have to buy all this before you find you know, there's no way to
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.640]   You have to kind of buy into it
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:25.200]   I don't know what I'm gonna do because I'd like to get one of the new routers
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.360]   It looks like the only way to get a super pod is to buy a lifetime membership and two more pods
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.600]   Like I said, I have 12 of these guys
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:40.240]   I got I got heroes plumes everywhere because it's my I have them in my garage and stuff because it reaches out to all my out
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.240]   You know, it's my IOT network
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.720]   Well, so $200
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.480]   And that's a lifetime membership, by the way, which I think is a lifetime membership
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.040]   And that's for five years my tivo oh lifetime is five years
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.760]   Yes, and I think it's
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.720]   You may hate that but i'm gonna tell you that's a good thing that they're putting a limit on it as opposed to just being like
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.480]   Yeah, it's lifetime and then five years from now being like you want new routers anyway by then. Yeah, I would say
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.240]   Yeah
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.240]   Well, you know, I think the good news is that we're always going to be I still don't like it, but I got it
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.600]   But you have a choice. Yeah
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:18.000]   Yeah, and you do you can buy other there are plenty of other routers out there. So I just
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.920]   yeah
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:26.480]   I think it'll be really interesting to watch. It's a good indicator as more and more connected devices try to be focused more on the
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.680]   Service than the hardware. Are we really ready for that?
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.560]   And there really are a lot of things a router can do better than the current proper routers
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:38.240]   There's a lot of ways it could be better if it's an ongoing service. I think
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.520]   So
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   V shall see
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.360]   Is it time for our things?
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.840]   It's time for I want to do one thing one thing first
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.200]   Buses me. What's his name?
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.040]   Ah, where did it go former?
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.520]   Facebook
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.040]   Palmer lucky. Oh my god. This is insane
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.760]   He is you know, he discovers corporate politics. Gee some people don't like
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:13.520]   You know, just because the guy was what three years old when he sold the company and became a billionaire
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.520]   You know what's gonna have to do to his head
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.520]   Uh, so he's all concerned about Facebook and he's been three years there and some people just don't like me
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.480]   He's people here's the point of why I wanted this. You know what he's doing now. He's killed me. Yes
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.600]   Virtual reality border protection
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.160]   She's Palmer lucky was the founder we should mention of oculus
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.800]   Made a lot of money selling it to
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.400]   Facebook he actually first made a lot of money off of me and others like me who gave him money in a kickstarter
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.760]   box
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.320]   And then turned around a couple of years later and made a lot more money selling it off to facebook
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:56.080]   Uh, he made it good because he gave us the new oculus riff for free. So that was okay. I was I got two oculus riffs out of it
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:02.720]   Uh, he got he kind of got let go of facebook after it turned out he had created a kind of meme
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:04.560]   troll
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.000]   agency
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]   on on reddit
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.240]   pro-trump kind of
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.000]   meme
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   System that was bizarre
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.640]   Uh, and they didn't they didn't like that. So he went off and did this new thing
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.680]   And he's been you know, he has close relationship with trump. He's been trying to sell this to trump and apparently it's being used
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:26.960]   And apparently successfully according to this article
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.640]   With period article
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.440]   a virtual border wall the verge
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:36.640]   out the vuij
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.520]   He has successes. He's got success stories
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.600]   so
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.640]   Instead of a physical wall his idea is you will build a
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.360]   virtual one built of cameras with machine learning to identify people in that sort of thing
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.120]   um
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.120]   and he
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.840]   He's very well in the verge says they've already caught dozens of people
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.520]   Yes, it's barely a year old
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:08.720]   They've installed three tower three 32 foot towers packed with radar communications gear and a laser enhanced camera
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:13.040]   Um, it's called lattice soon lasers to shoot you down probably
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:16.400]   So that's the question is that bridge you from your baby
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:24.000]   So it's being tested on private property right now, right? So, but there's a lot of interest
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.800]   uh over a 10 week span and doril that's the name of its security towers
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:34.080]   It's probably something out of middle earth right apparently help border agents catch 55 people
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:37.120]   sees 982 pounds of marijuana
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.320]   39 of the arrests were not connected to drugs
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:46.400]   Andoril is the company lattice is the technology the lattice is the communication gear. Yeah
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.080]   Hey, it's better than a wall
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:58.080]   Uh it it is I mean in there you can't deny we have the right to protect the border
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:03.200]   I'm I would have a hard time with this knowing what happens to the people afterwards
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:09.280]   You should fix that separately. I think yes, I'm not but I would I would definitely have a hard time
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.640]   as a founder building something that
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.360]   Then is used and the the other thing is once you have this there
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.680]   Why not put it?
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:21.840]   Everywhere there's another issue
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:24.320]   AC hunch and AC hund at mbc just tweeted
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.960]   Infant ripped from mother's arms while she was breastfeeding the baby at border attention center
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.400]   Mother handcuffed for resisting right that's the problem
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:41.520]   However, that's unrelated, but there is a little bit of concern because palantir a name that should send chills down your spine is also involved
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:50.240]   Uh peter teal and being involved sent enough chills down. I'm like, yeah, you know by the way both palantir and andoril are tolkin references
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.240]   They are from middle earth
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:54.960]   ah
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:53:01.280]   I bet you jr. Tolkien is spinning in his grave. This is a lot more like sauron than it is like a hobbit
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:07.840]   Um interesting so palantir has been known for doing all sorts of kind of creepy surveillance stuff very secretive
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.880]   Company and oh they have oh
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:18.560]   It's a it's an enchanted blade for the lord of the rings pal andoril is yeah andoril is uh what aragon's blade palantir
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:25.760]   Like when I was twelfth volunteers the one of those globes right one of those like crystal balls that uh sauron has
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.120]   Yeah, they are yeah and they they look yeah like the souties have like trump was holding and they look into them
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.640]   And they can see stuff palantirs. You can see what's going on in the other palantir
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:40.640]   So even the name tells you a little bit about what palantir is all about
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:46.160]   Okay, yeah and their pitch deck offered
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:51.920]   Autonomous long range bombers attacked drone swarms and something they called perimeter security on a pole
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:56.480]   Is that a polish person
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:02.240]   No, they building a surveillance tower using off the shelf sensors and cameras connect them to the network and make it something in the
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:04.240]   Spirit of google maps and pokemon go
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.600]   And that's actually what they built
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:14.080]   So we talk a lot about how uh, we lately we talk a lot about how technologists should have
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.960]   ethical uh and uh
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.920]   You know
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:24.320]   Basies of the things they develop and really think about the consequences, but this is the problem is there are plenty of technologists out there
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.520]   Who do and their decision is yeah, let's go for it
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:31.360]   But this is this is exactly the consequence we want
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.760]   I mean there are challenge. I mean like here in texas building the wall is a big issue because there are places
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:44.160]   There are places that a run through private property run through like wildlife and bird reserves
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.920]   So something like this is a lot, you know, it doesn't hinder migration patterns of animals for example
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.800]   Well, it probably cost less than 18 billion dollars, which is the I think they had 7.6
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.040]   Was that the number the story hold on?
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.760]   And it sounds like it actually might be more effective than a wall the problem with walls is people can tunnel right under him
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.440]   I guess you if you would be telling us this you could tunnel under this too. Yeah
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.160]   You have a long tunnel
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:10.960]   Well, so now what would be interesting is because you can
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.080]   You can uh
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.480]   Not hack you can fool AI cameras by wearing weird makeup
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:23.040]   So if you change your physical file, it would be interesting all the new
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:29.040]   Immigrants will be wearing just robot masks or or no, I'll tell them right now what you should do
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:35.520]   You can make a led collar that emits light that blinds the camera. You look that's true. I are colors
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.560]   Yeah, you everything looks normal to you everything's going fine
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:39.760]   You are wearing a strange necklace
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:45.280]   But other than that and you're completely invisible to the camera and some you know what Jeff, let's let's stay
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:48.400]   See, let's start a business making those. Yeah, that's gonna be
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:55.680]   Not just everybody will wear one of these so that the face recognition stuff doesn't work. Okay. This is your first
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.760]   Affiliate commerce deal. This is brilliant
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:04.160]   But then you have to walk funny because there's also gate analysis
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:07.120]   So you every morning you have to have a new walk
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.080]   Well, there's the funny
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.240]   Hence we play the video with a funny walk
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.560]   Association. Yes. Come on. Come on Carson. You can find that
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:26.160]   Whereas Andy in German industry of silly walks. Yeah, it's a money Python bit and Andy in Germany says the leds do not work
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:29.760]   Yeah, I think it's ir, isn't it? Yeah, it's infrared
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.360]   Colleen our old chief engineer was gonna make one of these for me. She's not working at facebook
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.040]   Yes, there's a silly walk
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.000]   So you do that so the gate analysis won't work you wear one of these uh infrared beaming necklaces
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.880]   And you just look like strange
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.640]   Silly glowing ball
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.640]   And what are they gonna do shoot you?
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.960]   Probably
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.680]   Yeah, probably they'll just send people just send people
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:59.440]   The soon they'll make those collars the illegals what they'll do
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:02.400]   Stacy iigenbotham. Do you have a pick this week?
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.920]   I do
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:08.240]   I just did a review of the camera that we have talked so much about the
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:13.120]   Wow, it's moving a winds on order. Oh, I have three and I love it
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:16.160]   so I
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.440]   if you
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.560]   On the website I show videos of it doing things. It's hard to do without a stable base for it to
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.520]   I can I can I can fire it up on my phone
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:28.160]   Here we go. Hold on
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.880]   All right. Well, I just want to show you it moving around
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.840]   Yeah, put your microphone next to it too because there is a little bit of uh
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.240]   mechanical noise
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.160]   Wait, but you don't see it do you oh, this is the wrong camera. I'm an idiot. Okay
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.760]   Okay, I would never say that because you'd punch me
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:53.360]   I'll show you I'll show you while she's setting that up here. This is there it is
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.840]   This is the view I can double tap it to go full screen
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.080]   Of my office just in the other room and what's cool about this
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.240]   Is um, you can zoom in you can pan tilt and zoom
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:08.880]   Just with your finger, which is really cool or you can use the controller
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.520]   Uh, it does a patrol
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:17.840]   It has it's 30 bucks. This thing is amazing and it stores like two weeks on the cloud. Yeah
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.160]   Two weeks for free on the cloud for free
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.480]   Uh, you can have a pan scan which I turn that on and it'll automatically patrol
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.600]   It also tags with motion and by the way, it doesn't store anything. There's no motion. There's no video
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.240]   But you can turn it on and go live anytime
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:38.080]   And what's really interesting about it is there's no website. It's all on the device
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.560]   On your on your phone
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.760]   So there's it's kind of I feel a little more secure for that reason to me. I maybe not
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:50.320]   What do you think it does use a es 128 encryption? Yeah, um, so it's not quite bank grade, but it's good
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.680]   Um
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:55.600]   And yeah, I I love it. I think it's for 30 bucks
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.400]   Yeah, I wouldn't use it
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.840]   Like all internet connected cameras my when I talked about it
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:07.360]   I was like I have two places where I could see this being useful one is in my garage because when my garage door is like
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.200]   Help
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:14.880]   Um, I've been open too long. I want to be able to see what's happening before I close it because I keep closing it on my husband
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.000]   Um, and then this is very thoughtful of you
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.760]   Is it in 30 bucks? That feels reasonable. Um, although I don't need this when I could use a $20 one for that
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:28.640]   And then the other use case is when we're out on vacation just sticking it in my house
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.280]   The thing I don't like about it is there is no privacy. You can't actually turn it off
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:38.320]   Yeah, the light so that's what I like about the lighthouse one either least her eye or home. There's no camera
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:42.400]   Otherwise, she does not like the idea of having a camera in the house. She won't accept it
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.960]   So I can't put this in the house for instance
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:48.720]   And that's it panning all around and I was just amazing how it's
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:53.760]   It's 15 frames per second in the day in ten at night. So it's not like
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.760]   Whoo
[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:58.880]   But it's it's good enough for 30 bucks. I'll show you
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:01.920]   The uh, the cat problem I discussed last week. Yeah
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:06.080]   Yeah, see what your cat's doing and people were very nice on twitter
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.560]   No, she doesn't have an infection. She probably has a balanced problem and gets confused in the box
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:17.360]   Let me show you um one of the things so this is a view of my office from a distance. We're gonna zoom in a little bit
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.120]   Um, which will degrade the picture. It's actually a better quality than that
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:26.640]   But uh, you mentioned stacy the 15 frames. I don't think the motion is a big issue
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.440]   And I can zoom in there's a license plate
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.840]   Watch this. Oh, so I gotta take come here camera. You're going the wrong way. Oh the other way
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.240]   I'm trying to control it with my finger
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.320]   Come on camera. Come on. Stop it. There you go. I can zoom in
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.040]   There's a license plate
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.040]   Um, there whoop
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.680]   I gotta turn off the uh, the the the pan and scan
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.800]   And zoom out again so I can find it, but there's a license plate that's at the at the end of the range I can read
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:00.400]   So let me show you. I mean it's way way far away
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:03.680]   But this is enough resolution that if I zoom in
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:09.600]   God damn it. Yeah, flip your phone to the side. We can then see the whole image. Oh, yeah, you're right. Of course. What am I thinking?
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:12.560]   Come on go full screen
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:19.520]   Huh, do you have it in portrait mode? Uh, I probably have it turned off that I can do that. Hold on
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.000]   Go back. Um, somebody brought this up in the chat room. I don't know if this is true, but I have no reason to doubt them
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.360]   Um, they say that the wise cam 2.0 has a 4.0 or 40 character limit on your password
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:40.000]   Which I mine as sub 40 characters, but I would not I would not buy this and have to change all of my device password
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.120]   I'm really sorry about that. There's a there is
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:46.240]   a license plate
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:51.680]   Pretty far and that it zooms away pretty far away. I have to say it's got time to eight stamp
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.800]   I think it's you can turn off all that automatic stuff, right? Yeah
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.120]   Yeah, you can turn off the automatic panning and all that stuff
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.800]   I like that, but yeah for your cat. You don't want to do that. You want to keep it pointing where it's yeah
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:09.120]   No, you just would set on motion alerts. I assume yeah for you and if you pop an SD card in there, it'll just
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.400]   Yeah
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:16.880]   It also somebody on reddit was complaining. Hey, I see it pinging china
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:24.640]   And what I like is the developers were very responsive. They get right on and they said yeah on an android phone because there's no notification system
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:31.040]   We on the apple phone we use apple's notification system on the android phone. We have we have a paid service that's happens to be out of china
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.440]   That does those uh
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.040]   Notifications for you. So that's why but the camp but the video is not sent to china
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:40.720]   Right leo does it have multiple camera views on the app?
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:48.320]   I only have one camera because I gave my other camera away. So uh, you know, I haven't set up the other ones. Uh, I would assume so but
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:51.600]   Uh, I don't know. That's a good question. Why wouldn't it if
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.520]   Uh, oh, I never assume anything. Yes, it does. I'll tell you why
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:02.720]   It does because so i'll show you there's a devices page right now. I'll have one thing in it, which is a named
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.760]   camera, but I can have more cameras there. Yeah, so it's in the devices page you can choose
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.560]   And I don't know what the limit is but uh, I'll you know, I'm sure it's a few
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.040]   You could see a history of notifications
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:20.320]   The main thing is the price. I mean there are probably you know, this is probably the lighthouse is probably a better deal
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:23.440]   Uh, I'm not a better deal a more powerful device
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.680]   But it's a lot more expensive and you have to and you have to pay a monthly fee for subscription
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.920]   There's no monthly fee for this, which is amazing to me
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.160]   Stacey on on yours. I didn't see the wire going to the electric plug
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:38.320]   Yeah, there is there is it's because it's on a white countertop
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:43.520]   Oh, I see okay. It's kind of a little micro usb port and plugs into the wall
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:47.040]   For I think for 30 bucks
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.440]   Somebody said high web saying he has four cameras on on one app. So yes
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:57.600]   Well, someone's saying that these should not be considered for security because of their five-minute cooldown
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.240]   I don't know. I don't know. I'm missing talking about what that means
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.240]   Missing you'll have to explain more things say more
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.640]   um
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:11.760]   So yeah, this I mean this this just seemed like a really
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.080]   Fun thing. I would not keep it running all the time, but you sold one last week
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:22.880]   Whoo. Yeah, and so three one percent commission three cents. Well, but you could have stacey
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:25.840]   I could have bought it for you or you Leo
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.800]   Yeah
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.800]   Yeah
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:38.160]   I don't want to spend fourth week on the careers. This is why I'm not rich. I don't I'm not spending time thinking about monetization particularly
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.400]   I'm just trying to keep my head above water
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.880]   Jeff Jarvis you have a number for us?
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880]   um
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:49.360]   So I just no not really so i'm gonna fake this one
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:55.120]   So I was going through links today and I saw that already search engine land is is gearing up
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:00.000]   Be writing about the google 20th anniversary. Oh my god. When's that kind of be?
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:04.800]   Uh, later this year, so we're gonna have the endless birthday festival
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.000]   But I didn't say you know two decades of google man. That's that's
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.960]   That's hard to believe that's amazing
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:17.280]   What but still in gutenberg time. It's only 1470. It's nothing. What would we have done?
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.640]   If there had been no google we'd still be using altevista
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:29.200]   Uh mine is not something I necessarily recommend, but I think it's kind of interesting
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:34.480]   Uh, if you if you're in cyclopedia botanica, you're really wondering
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.800]   What do we do in the 21st century?
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.160]   There's this free thing called wikipedia that in many cases actually
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:43.760]   Is is better and more up to date than in cyclopedia botanica?
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:49.120]   Yeah, botanica has for years generations been considered the you know kind of definitive
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:52.240]   uh keeper of truth
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.400]   So they've made it
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:59.600]   Then they're gonna make some big bucks on this a chrome extension called botanica insights
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.240]   and as you're in your search
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:06.560]   As you're looking around on the right you'll get a new knowledge graph
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.600]   with botanica content
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:14.240]   So the same this is I guess in addition to the google. Shall we search for something and see?
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.920]   Let's uh
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:20.160]   Let's see. Let's look for macedonia because macedonia is about to rename itself
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.720]   because of the greek
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:27.120]   There's the botanica insight above the knowledge card from google
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:34.160]   So if I want to learn more about macedonia in addition to the wikipedia entry as a good way to kind of
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:38.720]   Make their assertion you can at least compare the two it's free
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:42.080]   botanica wikipedia
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.240]   Britannica wikipedia
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:50.560]   There's a little little tip for you some nandy or chrome everything in the cause of truth
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:57.680]   Yeah, I think that they probably saw this as an opportunity to uh to jump on the truth bandwagon
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.560]   I
[02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:02.800]   Jeff Jarvis is the say it again
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:09.360]   All right, we're gonna get a big deep breath here. I am the letter of towel professor for journalistic innovation

[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:27.120]   Can we put that airs is a blog post on medium? Can we put that in is that uh lower third?
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.200]   Can we fit that?
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:34.480]   Oh, there you go
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:37.440]   constant scroll
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.800]   Maybe by the end of the show we'd get to the end of this at the end of the title
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:45.920]   He is also a blogger buzz machine.com author many a great book including and as I always point out
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:50.800]   Cohost of this week in google a very proud thing for me very important finally at the end of the show

[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.160]   No, no, no, it's all right the show's over Stacy. There's no point
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:19.040]   Uh like she's drawing the blinds

[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:53.360]   Gosh, I love it when when they mix the fruit in with the salad the sweetest savory. I love that
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:56.800]   My fate. I like a watermelon feta salad. That's so good
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.760]   It is good. Isn't that good maybe a little bit of micro greens thrown in there
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:06.480]   I'm actually i'm rereading uh, Anthony Bourdain's kitchen confidential
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.120]   And now I never want to eat out again

[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.120]   You know, I never got on the Bourdain train, but he really was a great writer
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.200]   I loved watching the show when I did the problem was was on a lot, but I just well the good news Netflix has decided
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:29.280]   It was gonna go down and it's uh, it's gonna. They're gonna keep it on indefinitely now
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:36.400]   Great tribute to okay, because it wasn't about the food was about people was about all about travel openness to to culture
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:39.120]   Yeah, which is why I can't believe that I wasn't
