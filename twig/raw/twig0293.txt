[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.000]   We're going to talk about the FTC investigation of Google from a couple of years back.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   Turns out it wasn't as cut and dried as we thought a big debate ahead of this week in Google.

[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.000]   This week in Google to show the coverage Google the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, all that jazz.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.560]   Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY. Actually, he's from his home.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   I don't like jazz. You know like jazz? I'm not jazz.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.840]   You looked like somebody would go to the West Village, the Village Mayside.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.280]   None of it. No, not in jazz. Don't tell me your duvetub step.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.640]   Let me know what it is. Good. My notional Jeff Jarvis is intact sort of.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.760]   When I ran E.W., I tried to ban jazz. What?
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.720]   Hotty. Just to be troubled too. That's fine.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.800]   Well anyway, welcome Jeff. He's the author of What Would Google Do? Public Parts? His latest
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.040]   Geeks? Bearing Geeks? I wish I have it the other way. I should bring it so I can hold it up.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.200]   Because of course Jeff doesn't have a copy. He can hold up.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.800]   I would have to go all the way. Good to have you Jeff. Also with us Mike
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.840]   Algern, our news director and Mike and I this morning got up. Well, you didn't get up.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.680]   You actually, I guess you did. I got up the usual time. The usual time, which is like three
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480]   in the morning or some ungodly hour. And I like jazz. And in fact, I have a quick.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.760]   That doesn't surprise me. Quick recommendation, a movie, there's a movie called Whiplash.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   Is that good? Of course Oscar nominated and I think he won an Oscar. Somebody won an Oscar.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.400]   It's very good and it'll give you an appreciation for jazz. They emphasize the
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.280]   sadistic qualities of sort of band leading and instruction and so on. But it's a great movie
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.080]   and this is a lot of great jazz in it. It's a high school jazz band, right? I think it's college
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.120]   level. It's like a New York Academy of some kind and yeah, it's a great movie.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.000]   And of course, JK Simmons is the star of that. We love him from his insurance company ads.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.440]   It's a little disconcerting to see a guy who I remember for insurance company ads
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   on the Oscar stage. But you can do everything these days. It's no longer a stigma to do an ad.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.640]   So I think easily the big story today is this thing that the Wall Street Journal has been reporting.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.840]   The FTC and we reported this at the time a couple of years ago, investigated Google
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:26.000]   and ended up deciding not to prosecute them. But now the details from the FTC investigation
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   have been leaking out on the Wall Street Journal. I guess the journal got it. Did they get it in
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.400]   the FOIA request? They made it for request. The FTC accidentally sent them the 160 page report.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.520]   Then said, Oops, could we have it back? And the journal said, no too late.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.160]   Freedom of Information Act. So the staff report apparently was a little bit more
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.280]   negative about Google. There are two reports as a staff report and there's an economist report.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   Okay, staff report is lawyers. Economist report worries about impact on the economy and on
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.560]   consumers and this is different. And I do you know, you can read it on the journal, but I think
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.640]   Danny Sullivan has been doing a marvelous job at marketingland.com. We actually try to get up
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.320]   in the show. He's not available parsing the report. And apparently the journal is only publishing every
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.840]   other page. Is that right? It's some weird thing where he has he has a real other page.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.080]   And then he says the footnotes are tying stuff together back to other pages.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   So there's lots of juice in it. Search engine land. There isn't.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.520]   Well, okay. This is why I thought it would be a good conversation for this show,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.200]   because the impression that you get from the Wall Street Journal article is the FTC should
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   have prosecuted and that went easy on Google and that there's plenty of smoking guns. Is that not
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.120]   your sense? Oh, from the Wall Street Journal, absolutely. And the Wall Street Journal. I mean,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.760]   let's let's keep in mind here. And I said at the end of the piece that I wrote about this,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.920]   I wish Google would f up more so I could criticize them more. I don't want to be
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.720]   in the refrigerator defending them too often. Yeah, and I'm not going to defend them fully on this.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.040]   But let's keep in mind for context that that Robert Murdoch has had an absolute attack going
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   on against Google. He had Robert Thompson, the head of News Corp, write a screed against Google.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.000]   After this report came out, they then went and got the visitor logs for the White House saying,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.600]   look how often Googlers go and visit the White House. 230 private meetings.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.440]   Yeah, well, I'm surprised at that. They're an important company. I'm sure they're not the
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.320]   only company that had many meetings in the White House. They might have brought t-shirts. You
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.720]   know, I don't know. Yeah. So the report, and this is the one by the lawyers,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.760]   yes, labeled them a monopoly and recommended litigation. Is that right?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:47.520]   Yes, some yes. Yes. Shortly after the report came out, the FTC decided to close the investigation.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.000]   But no, they said, well, they did. Some changes behavior. Yeah. But they didn't go on for
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.520]   investigation and note that it was unanimous across party lines. The Journal was trying to
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.600]   hint that there was a political game here. That's why all the meetings at the White House,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.840]   but the Washington Post wrote a very good and balanced explanation of what goes on and how
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.360]   in these investigations there are these two normals. They come together. This is normal.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.280]   Yeah. So there is a contingent often that advocates stronger action than the FTC ends up
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.360]   taking. It doesn't mean the FTC decided to lose. The lawyers like to sue you.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   Yeah. So Danny Sullivan says, it turns out, a vocal contingent inside the FTC wanted stronger,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.960]   action. The report written by the FTC's Bureau of Competition is one of several sets of
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.200]   findings and recommendations. The commissioners then take it all into account. And as you say,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:46.160]   the Post says that somebody's always going to be left out. Not everyone will be handled.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.280]   They ultimately voted against bringing legal action, although they did say that Google was
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.880]   able to mitigate some of the issues. The report concluded that Google had abused its market
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.240]   position. Google's conduct has resulted and will result in real harm to consumers and to
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.440]   innovation in the online search and advertising markets. The evidence paints a complex portrait
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.680]   of a company working toward an overall goal of maintaining its market share by providing the
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.720]   best user experience. That's not illegal. While simultaneously engaging in tactics that resulted
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.520]   in harm to many vertical competitors and likely helped to entrench Google's monopoly power of
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.800]   research and search advertising. And this is the thing I've always said was a red flag with Google
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.760]   was that they are in all of these businesses, Google, local, YouTube, Google shopping,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:47.520]   the Google flight thing, the booking stuff, where they would have a temptation to put their
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.040]   results ahead of competition's results, even if technically in the search, it shouldn't be.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.840]   If PageRank wouldn't rate them that highly. And that's essentially the fundamental complaint
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.880]   here, right? That they found evidence that Google had done that.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.560]   Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. So it's not that clear, especially if you look at Danny Sullivan's
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.840]   posts on this, exactly what it is that they found. They found a lot of tweaking.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.360]   And from what I can gather, first of all, this is from 2007. And at the time, apparently Google
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.720]   was vexed by the fact that product searches for product and service oriented results were very
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.000]   poor. The user experience was poor. So if you forget about the content, the experience was very
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.320]   poor. And they were testing these different types of results against groups of people
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.160]   and seeing whether they said, okay, I like this result. I don't like that result.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.520]   Yeah, we'll call these testers the searchers. That's what Danny is the term Danny uses.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.120]   Exactly. Sounds like a creepy movie.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.560]   But these are like focus groups.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.240]   Exactly. Focus groups, exactly. And so Google has something called a diversity algorithm. So
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.680]   if, for example, if somebody searches for Leel Report, they're going to get all this praise for
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.200]   Leel Report. But Google will go find some criticism of Leel Report and throw it in there.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.360]   Because that makes searchers happy. Well, because it gives balance.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.880]   Because you're choice. Yeah, exactly. And so that's not inappropriate, I think.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.640]   And so they were tweaking that. So my guess would be that yes, they did things that made some of
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.040]   their competitors rank worse. And they probably did things that made some of their competitors
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.520]   rank better than they would have. They're trying to tweak and fudge these numbers so that it looks
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.920]   balanced and gives users a result that makes them think, okay, this is the result that I was
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.320]   looking for. That's where the debate lies. Were they doing this to improve search results?
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.920]   Or were they doing this to defeat the competition? And now in one part that I read in the Wall Street
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   Journal, it said that Google would go to searchers. Searchers would be unhappy with their results.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.520]   And they would still go with it. Sticked it with it anyway. Yeah.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.240]   And so that gives lie to the idea that they're trying to make better search results. That
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.480]   implies, just reading that by itself, that Google is acting anti-competitively. This is what the
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.160]   journal said in a sidebar, how Google skewed search results. Google would automatically boost
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.080]   its own sites for certain specialized searches that otherwise would favor rivals. This is from the
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.720]   FTC report. If a comparison shopping site was supposed to rank highly, Google's shopping
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.800]   was placed above it. When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user search query, Google Local
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.760]   would pop up on top of the results page the staff wrote. Now Danny points out this is common
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.000]   practice. I don't know if this lets Google off the hook, but this is common practice among search
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.400]   engines. In fact, he's written many articles that talk about this. He's not in favor of this,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.120]   but he says this is how search engines work. The thing that's really important though,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.240]   in antitrust action, a monopoly action is a company that's not a monopoly can get away,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:05.200]   can legally do things that a company that is a monopoly cannot. So Microsoft bundles Internet
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.920]   Explorer as a browser because of Microsoft's dominant position in operating systems,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.800]   the Department of Justice went after them, even though if Leo's operating system bundled a browser,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.760]   that'd be fine. Or actually OS 10 bundled a browser, that'd be fine. And it's because of
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.160]   the dominant position. Antitrust law is all about not using your dominant position
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.640]   to enter other markets. And it sounds like that's exactly, but here's here's, and I have this
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.200]   argument with somebody at the Guardian on Twitter, who's to say that Google is what it started to be
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.080]   as a search engine? I would define Google as a personal services company. And I would say that
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   it's not entering other markets. It's expanding its service as one would. You know, McDonald's adds
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   breakfast. It's a restaurant. I would also argue that this is something that always pops up when
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.280]   you talk about the Google, you know, the Facebook algorithm, when they were caught doing experiments
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.240]   on users, people were talking about that for a while. We don't talk about it anymore. But this,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:11.360]   this is an example. You can be sure that Google search group is changing everything every single
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.800]   day. They are tweaking and changing and they admitted and they told in a follow-up to Danny
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.200]   part of their job. It's what they do. But they told Danny that the big, they were trying to solve a
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.640]   specific problem that existed seven years ago, which was, which was that the results for when
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.720]   you're looking for things like restaurant reviews and things like that, the results were crap. And
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.840]   they were trying to make the results be something that was more appealing to end users. My guess is
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:46.080]   that the results changed. Other companies changed and they kept tweaking it and changing it. Whether
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.040]   they tweaked it in a way that was anti-competitive in a new way or not, we have no idea. We have no
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   data on that at all. But my guess is that this is a moving target. They basically got a snapshot of
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.240]   some tests that Google were doing at some point. And that didn't sound right. It didn't feel right.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.360]   It was seen anti-competitive, especially if you assume, which I don't know that they did
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.320]   assume, that it's the search results are set it and forget it thing where you write the algorithm
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.240]   and you walk away. And then it's supposed to be fair and blind and all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   That's of course not. That's never going to be the case.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.760]   That Danny quotes his 2008 article that he wrote on how this works exactly. This is seven years
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.840]   ago, right about this timeframe. He's quoting Marissa Meyer. He's a Marissa Meyer said,
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.440]   "The first result in Google might get clicked on more than a third of the time out of all clicks."
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.080]   In other words, that first result is the result that really counts. In fact, Google's search quality
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.560]   team makes it a goal to try to make that first result as relevant as possible.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   Universal search, well, he goes on to say in contrast, the one box insertions, those are those
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.880]   boxes on the side, right? Get clicked on less despite getting prime placement on the page
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.360]   since they aren't as relevant. Or maybe the one box is the one that's in the search results
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.120]   above the first click. Anyway, Universal search, this is his articles about this technique,
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.080]   aims to fix this through something called blending. With Universal search search,
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.680]   Google will hit a range of its vertical search engines, then decide if the
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.960]   relevancy of a result from book search, for instance, is higher than a match from web page search.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:27.520]   Overall, now Danny writes today what the FTC staff seem to find so damning about Google actually
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.400]   reads like a standard practice to those who know how search engines operate and why they operate
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:40.800]   the way they do. But then he says, not this part. And this, it's not clear, but I think this is
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.760]   from his story in 2008 while Google from the, I can't, you know, Danny, the staff said, so, okay,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   this is the Wall Street Journal. Yeah, this is the journal story. While Google promoted its own
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.320]   results, it sometimes, and this is the key, demoted rivals, the FTC staff found. For example,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.000]   Google compiled a list of comparison shopping sites that compete with Google shopping,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.800]   and demoted them from the top 10 web results staff wrote. According to the report, and here's
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.680]   what we were talking about with searchers, Google users and tests didn't like those changes.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:21.120]   Only after Google tweaked its search algorithm at least four times and changed the ranking criteria
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:28.480]   that the new results get slightly positive feedback. Slightly positive. That's when Google went
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.680]   with it and said, all right, we were able to move the needle a little anyway. It's always
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.520]   worried me about Google. And we've always said on this show, there's no smoking gun.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.160]   But keep going, but keep going. That's alarming. Danny writes, Google has consistent, this is his
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.640]   modern article, this consistently said over the years in various ways at various times, it doesn't
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:54.320]   blacklist particular websites for competitive reasons. Yes, sites might get manually penalized
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.560]   or hit with algorithmic penalties for violating Google spam guidelines. Matt cuts does this all
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.360]   the time. In fact, that was a big improvement search results when Matt cuts stopped linking search
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.080]   results from the search results. And that was a big problem. Remember, you'd get it linked farms
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.480]   and stuff. But no, Danny writes, Google has said it does not try to wipe out Yelp or Bing or Expedia
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.440]   just because they compete with it in search areas. The Wall Street Journal's article about the FTC
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   staff report suggests evidence. This is not the case that Google indeed actively decided it would
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.480]   demote competing sites and did so even though its searchers didn't like it. And there's three
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.240]   post scripts here. Yeah, so we talked with the Wall Street Journal reporter first post script,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.400]   Rolf Winkler about the demotion section, a scan of the actual footnote covering this in the Wall Street
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.880]   Journal site. But I haven't been able to locate it yet. Sounds like Google may have been doing a test
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   that didn't go out to all searches at the time when I ended up approving this diversity that we
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.480]   were talking about of search results. One of the big problems at the time writes, Danny, is that it
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.600]   was common to searches that led back to pages of search results at other sites, which is, as we all
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.240]   agree, a pretty bad user experience Google even issued a guidance against it. The guideline remains
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.720]   although Google pretty much seems to ignore it. So what he's saying is this example, you do a search
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.960]   for buying a product. You click the top result, which actually leads you back to another shopping
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.320]   site, which gives you more of its search results. This is an experience Google says isn't a good
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.040]   experience. And they demoted them for that reason, not because they're competing. Am I reading that
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.920]   correctly? Yeah, and keep growing. Okay, post script post script to. I feel like we're in court.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.040]   I found Danny writes where the Wall Street Journal has posted some of the original reported
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.480]   obtained the section about demoting competing sites is covered in footnote 154, the cot text
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.840]   to what 154 is covering isn't provided. This is the case where we don't have the page, but we have
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.640]   the footnote from the page. And by the way, only Danny Sullivan bless his heart would go through
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.840]   and find footnote 155. I was watching him at five or six this morning live. Actually, it was six
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.240]   his time. I was at three a.m. this morning, California time watching him live tweet this process. It
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.560]   was amazing of going back and forth. And that's why I really wanted to get him on, but he's
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.480]   only sleeping. Although Google originally sought to the foot note, although Google originally sought
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   to demote all comparison shopping websites after Google Raiders provided negative feedback to such
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.080]   a widespread demotion, Google implemented the current iteration of its so called diversity
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.440]   algorithm. Google claimed the goal of this algorithm was to increase the diversity of Google's
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.280]   search results for product related queries. So far, I don't have a problem with that kind of
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.200]   exit. Zero problem, right? We don't want to search for a product and then get a page that's full of
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.920]   searches for a product. But there were companies that there was a company, a couple companies have
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:00.160]   sued Google saying you've ruined our business. We are a legitimate, you know, index. And Google
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:08.240]   says, no, you are a awful comparison site in just spammy. And this is where I have long, long,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.600]   long argued that Google is at its most vulnerable because it does indeed hold the power of God
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   over these companies. And what I have suggested nobody pays attention to me, but what the hell
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   is that Google should have some kind of outside jury of commercial peers, because it's in the
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.840]   interest of decent companies not to have that crap in search. And somebody though has to judge,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.840]   is this a legitimate company? Or is this just a crappy comparison site that's just trying to get
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.800]   search juice? And it's not sometimes an easy call. And that's where Google is at some vulnerability.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.560]   And this shows the vulnerability. Yeah. And it's why I've said again and again,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.200]   Google just shouldn't get any side businesses. No, no, that's where I know I'm through. I think
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.160]   you're wrong. But there's always going to be Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.040]   There's always going to be the suspicion if Google's in a competing business that it's going to favor
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.680]   its search results. Is it a competing business to give me as I'm using regularly now,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.360]   flight results directly on Google versus making me go through for Cockney Expedia,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.000]   which is a pain in the butt. Well, in that case, that case single provides a better service to me
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   through its direct flight recommendations for which it bought a company for which is having a
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.240]   competitive impact on the others. I don't know how much fun, you know, because it's a search result.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.960]   The search is a vertical search, a flight research. And in fact, when you click the link, you are then
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.680]   sent to the airline. So all it's doing is giving it's a that's a former search.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.360]   Look at any commission. I don't know. Here's where I let's use a cleaner example.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.720]   Yeah, I know. But but that's a search. That's a search function. Let's give you a cleaner example.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.560]   I search for a video. I search for Twit, a Twit V. I search for this week in Google,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.680]   and I get two results. Number one result is our show on YouTube. Number two result is our show on
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.600]   our webpage. Let's say I don't actually know if that happens. The problem is if that does happen,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.560]   there's this inevitable suspicion that Google's doing that to promote its own service over my site.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.240]   In fact, in fact, your site comes up first. The wiki entry comes up in YouTube.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.640]   No, but search for a show like I don't know what this week in Google. This week in Google
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.320]   two three four and yet putting another fly in the oven. We have personalized search. We come up
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.720]   first. We come up first. Nice listing. Yeah. YouTube is the third result. And this is one of the
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.120]   problems with with this criticism or this fear that that Google is going to favor. It's actually
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:34.720]   very difficult to to do searches and find clearly skewed results. It's yeah. That's why we search on
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.840]   search on this week in Google, the words. Yeah. But all I'm saying is that's why I think it's
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.440]   important. It shows the quality of search. Look, look, yeah, search on speaking Google. And that's
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.320]   why I've given them a pass because in these obvious examples, they've been very nice.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.920]   Yeah. But yes, these are the obvious examples. And by the way, YouTube is the number two result,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.880]   which it probably shouldn't be. But nevertheless, you're right. And that's why I've always given
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.760]   a pass. Okay, as far as I can tell, they've not been, you know, doing that. But now we have a
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.360]   smoking gun and this that they are doing it for diversity or whatever. The point is they are,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.640]   they would be above suspicion if they weren't in YouTube, if they didn't own YouTube, if they
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.600]   weren't in these businesses, that's. But I know it's a, it's a priority. I was just say, and so,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.240]   and so, so, you know, you freeze dry a company at one point and say, this is what it is.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.200]   Google, I think in the long run is not primarily a search company. Google, as I just said a few
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.400]   minutes ago, is a personal services company. I value Gmail as much as I value search.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.520]   I understand. It's an ad company. So, but this is why there's some difficulty here. And the easiest
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.440]   way to cut this problem would be just not set yourself up in competing businesses. But then,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.760]   no, but then you have frozen, you freeze dried the company and you put a fence around what it's
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.280]   allowed to do because it's in one business. And you defined it by that beginning business.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   Okay. But that's what any trust law does. What any trust law says is you cannot use your dominance
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.640]   in one sector to then give you an advantage in other sectors. I don't think, here's, I don't think
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.200]   they've done that in this case. Let's go to the next case of the FCC. Or does you want to continue
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.040]   on? No, no, no, I think that's a response. Enough said. Enough said. No, no, whoa, whoa, I want to go
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.760]   to the rest of the NPC thing, but, but, but there's a Google response in Danny's piece right there.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.240]   Post script three? Yeah. Google sent me some background information now, which I'll summarize
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.960]   as follows. It didn't provide a statement. I can actually quote just info offered to explain the
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.880]   situation from its point of view. Google said, and this is Danny writing, in 2007, aggregator,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.200]   comparison sites were dominating results for product searches. We remember those bad old days.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:50.640]   And these sites were often of low quality. I used to use a price watch a lot. In fact, starting in
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.480]   2000, I used price watch all the time. Now, if I search for an Asus motherboard on Google,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.760]   and it sends me to a price watch search page, that may actually be what I'm looking for,
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.000]   but maybe not. And I don't think it's wrong for Google to say, well, that's probably not a good
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.440]   result. You want to find that Asus. Basically, you want us to do what price watch is doing,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.240]   and give you a list of places you could buy that Asus motherboard by price.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:23.520]   But you can also see how the FTC might say, well, that's just you getting in their business.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.720]   By the way, is price watch even around anymore? You'd hate to be in that business if Google's
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.280]   doing it. Even in cases of good quality, Google again with Danny, Google still felt it was a search
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.680]   issue when people would click from its search results to ultimately land on another list of
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.480]   search results. That would be the price watch example. Google says it was a desire to improve
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.040]   these user experience issues that motivated the experimentation, not an effort to push its own
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   shopping results. The goal Google says was to come up with the right mix of shopping aggregators
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.640]   as well as actual merchant sites. Eventually, Google says it found a mix its rate is liked.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.480]   The FTC says like the little, but okay, one that retained the best aggregators as well as providing
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.280]   for overall result diversity. That's what was kept. It stressed this type of diversity,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.000]   something it aims for in other instances. Let's say you search for Birdman where people may want
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.920]   theaters and show times, a trailer, info on actors as well as news. That's what Google does do very
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.560]   well. It does give you a diverse mix of results. Google says the shopping algorithm change was
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   limited to English language searches only for those within the US, those outside the US, such as in
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.560]   the EU or those searching and languages other than English from anywhere didn't get it. I don't know
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:41.520]   why that would be. Google said that the FTC addressed the experiment with its closing statement to say
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.400]   it was part of the changes that could "reasonably be viewed as improving the overall quality
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.720]   of Google search results because the first search page now presented the user with greater diversity
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.480]   of websites." You can see where the argument is. You could see both sides have a point of view.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.600]   You could see that the FTC commissioners having weighed those decided to trust Google's state.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.280]   The Wall Street Journal's report, I think, made it seem as if they had found the smoking gun and
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.520]   said, "I ha'd Google it bad." Let's go to something where I think there is a less clear case here,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   which I wrote about, which is that Google is accused of scraping TripAdvisor and Yelp and such.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.760]   They scrape things. I have no problem with that. I went through this piece by piece of,
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.800]   "Where's my line?" Scraping is not a problem. It's the same as reading.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.080]   Holding onto it so that you can analyze it for search behind your wall, not a problem,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.000]   in my view. Some argued that was a copyright violation to hold onto a copy. I don't have a problem with that.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.640]   That's what a search engine does. Let's face it.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.840]   Exactly. I have no problem with that.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.960]   Quoting from a site in the process of linking to it, well, this is the essence of the get-ready
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.720]   folks, "Lifestyle threat" and "Spain-link tax fight," but I've already made my view on that clear.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   I have zero problem. That's fair use.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:00.080]   I agree with you. It's an extract to give you an idea of what you're going to get.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.040]   Here's where we get to the problem.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.640]   It does not replace the content.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.440]   Here's where we get to the problem.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:12.400]   Snippets are okay. It is alleged that Google whole sale copied and
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.480]   republished content from the places like Yelp. That would be, in my view, a clear violation of
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:26.720]   copyright. The second part that of this was that it is alleged in the journal that when competitors
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.880]   ask Google to stop taking their content, and I'm quoting, it threatened to remove them from the
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.520]   search engine.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.800]   There's the problem. Google wields a mighty stick.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:42.240]   Would be a terrible action, but I don't see that that's been proven conclusively in what was said
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.000]   here. The reason is because what we know is, "Yelps never disappeared from search." In fact,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.200]   that's how I get to it most days when I search on a restaurant in the way home. It's the
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.360]   Yelp link that I click on because it has a better phone link on it, and I use it all the time.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.280]   I don't know that that actually ever happened. If Google threatened it, that would be wrong.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.760]   That would be evil. That would be ungoogly. I don't know whether there's pure guilt there.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.640]   So that's one case.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:13.920]   That's I agree with you. That would be a very strong smoking gun. You have to find an email to
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.120]   Yelp. Yelp should step forward. This is an opportunity to say, "Yeah, I got the email right
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.520]   here where Google says we're going to pull you." Let's see it. Now, let's also remember this is A,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:32.160]   this was seven years ago. It is a, if it happened, it's a wrong action. There should be something
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.560]   about that. I have no problem, but is that caused to launch a gigantic investigation to break up
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:43.920]   the company? I think one stupid sin does not make. Remember the whole case about Google supposedly
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.240]   scraping people's data as they drove by, and they were caused to break them up right then.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.680]   If they did that, that would be wrong. That would be evil. They shouldn't have done that.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.080]   There should be consequences, but one of those consequences. The next thing is this question of
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.800]   Google favoring its own services. I dig into that too. Here, I'm still going to say, and I
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.960]   understand your point, Leo, that they're in other businesses, and that puts them in a position of
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.800]   conflict of interest. That's why I've always said they can't own content purely. But
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:21.200]   let's remember a couple things. Who's that? Show me the law that says that search must be impartial.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.520]   Let's remember a couple things. Number one, that's the last thing you want, because that's
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:31.440]   noisy search. I want search to be highly partial, partial toward quality, relevance, authority,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   timeliness, and other facts. Impartialities also impossible. It is impossible. We know that in
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.920]   journalism, we know that in search. It's a ridiculous, made-up standard. No such standard exists.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:51.120]   Let's start there. Then let's also remember that the idea of ads in search originally came from
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.040]   Bill Gross's go to dot com, which became overture, which was bought by Yahoo. Google eventually had
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.880]   to pay, I believe the number was $365 million in a patent settlement with overture in Yahoo,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:09.680]   because they took the idea of putting ads in search. Now, when you go to did it, the advertiser paid
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.760]   for placement. They paid for preferential treatment in search. And that was the way it was. Google
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.640]   is the one who set their standard who said, no, that'll be bad search. So Google said its own bar.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.880]   There's no law anywhere that says you couldn't have prejudicial search. If you want to, you can.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.320]   It's a product. You can make prejudicial newspapers. You can make prejudicial TV shows. You can make
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:37.280]   prejudicial search. There's no law anywhere that says that search should be impartial in that sense.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.360]   Now, at the same time, the FTC does indeed take companies to action, not for violating the law,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.640]   but for violating the company's own promise to consumers. So the question here is, did Google
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.320]   ever promise to consumers that search results would be so-called impartial? I can't find that.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.960]   Google did promise that ads should be relevant and labeled. Both of those things are true.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:08.720]   So I don't see, if it's true that Google purposefully and with competitive intent,
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.920]   downgraded competitors to push its own services, I would say that would be wrong. But I do not
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:19.440]   think we've seen a smoking gun of that happening. The only other two points in the journal that I
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:25.360]   mentioned is one is that they allegedly restricted advertisers from using data obtained during a
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   Google ad campaign in ad campaigns elsewhere. I think that's wrong. I think that goes against
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.480]   the principles of Google and open information. And Google did stop that practice. I think it was
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.400]   a wrong practice. I don't know that it was necessarily illegal. I think it was ungoogly.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.520]   And then finally, in just a graphic, Google said that the journal said that Google tried to restrict
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.040]   sites that did search deals from also dealing deals with competitors, including Bing.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:55.520]   I would say that's just stupid. That would be a red cape for anti-trust investigators.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.080]   But in the report, according to the journal, one investigator said there was insufficient
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.000]   evidence. And so that one doesn't go. So in the bottom line here is that I don't see, again,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.400]   I wish they'd have helped more so I can criticize them about the more. I have criticism for things.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.520]   But I think that we have to take the journal's worldview and Murdoch's worldview here,
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.680]   going after Google with a grain of salt. And as the journals basically is trying to accuse
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   the White House of a politically motivated dropping of the action against Google because
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.120]   of the close connections to Google, witnessed the next story that came out was
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.840]   all the people who've gone from Google to the White House. I'm a journalist. I know how these
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.040]   tricks operate. And I think we've got to judge the messenger. There's another thing that has to
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.560]   be said anytime you talk about anti-trust because there's a bit of confusion about what
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.800]   is illegal and what isn't illegal. Now, I'm not a lawyer, but I do watch the good wife.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.480]   And one thing that people need to be aware of is the fact that it's not against antitrust law
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.360]   to do things that harm competitors. This is something people don't understand. You have to harm
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.040]   competition itself, the competitive process, meaning that you have to artificially inflate
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.720]   prices. You have to artificially do something that harms consumers. And then it can be an
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.600]   antitrust issue. This is very, very difficult in search results because you don't filter anything
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.520]   in search results. You rank things. All the results are always there. They're just in slightly
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.240]   different orders and throwing a fly into the ointment. They're different for individual people
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:33.200]   because of personalization. So for example, when you got YouTube as the second result looking for
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.520]   this week at Google, this is the third result. The second result was Wikipedia.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.080]   You'd almost have to log out to find out what you're doing. You start pulling the thread out of
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.360]   the sweater from the FTC's point of view. There's no end to it. And it will be very, very difficult
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.280]   to find that prices have been raised, that consumers have been harmed or any of this stuff.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:58.080]   Even as complex as these issues are, it's very difficult to actually make a solid case that
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.280]   will hold up. Which is what the economists report. That's what they concentrate on is just that.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.640]   The lawyers are concentrating on the actions and so on. Do me a favor. Go to Google and search for
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.800]   maps and then go to Bing and search for maps and tell me who's more upstanding.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.040]   I get Google Maps Map Quest. I got to log out though to really get this to be, let me sign
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.000]   out of my Google account and search for maps. Okay, without being signed in. Oh, actually, I didn't
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.360]   have to do that. I could have just done an incognito tab. Google Maps Map Quest, Yahoo Maps, Bing Maps,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:36.080]   Weather Maps. In other news, Map Quest still exists. Let me go to Bing.com. I don't think I'm
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.360]   signed in there and search for maps. But remember, Google's not going to make a big mistake. Bing is
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.600]   number one. Map Quest, number two, Yahoo Maps, Maps. I don't see Google. How far do we have to go to
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   get to Google? Keep going. I'll go to Google Maps. Go to Google Maps. Map Quest. Rand McNally.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.120]   It's not in the first page. She now, come on. Come on, folks. Which is the more upstanding company?
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.320]   And also, which is the better map service? Well, how do you make the case that Bing is the number
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.440]   one best? I think Google Maps is better than worldatlas.com and it's below it. I don't go for
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.600]   Cudge Bing putting their maps first. That's my other point. The other point I make is that if we
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.120]   if we held if we're calling Google a publisher and hold them to the standards, the publishers
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.400]   hold themselves to, they never promote their competitors. Never, never, never, never, never.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.120]   The European publishers led by the Germans made a big video about how when you search on
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.120]   shoes on Google, running shoes, running shoes, an example, oh my God, you're going to get ads, ads,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.680]   ads. But then you also get Nike and other companies. If you go to build the largest newspaper in
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.600]   Europe owned by the company that has led the fight against Google and there's a whole shoe
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:44.000]   tab on the site, you don't get anything but their own ads. And so do we expect people to promote
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.360]   us and us people? No, we don't in any other world. So why do we have this supposed standard
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.280]   of no self promotion and objective search? Because they're monopoly. They're no, sorry,
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.800]   there's no such thing as either. Well, and that's one of the things we also learned from the Wall
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.200]   Street Journal report, which is that Google was very happy to see com score results that said
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.760]   they're not a monopoly, even though they weren't accurate, because Google knows it's a monopoly.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.840]   They just don't want anybody else to think so. It says the rules change from an op-lage,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.800]   as you say. It's the wrong standard for monopoly. The issue isn't search monopoly. And the number
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.920]   is much as 50% higher in Germany. The issue is advertising monopoly. And that's why I said that
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.520]   Google's primary weakness is in having the power of God over whether advertisers may or may not
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.600]   be in the service and how they're treated. And that, if the FTC had any brains about how
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.800]   sorry, Danny's real point here is they don't understand how search operates. And this is the
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.480]   danger of government regulation of these kinds of activities. I think that's unfair. First of all,
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.240]   the FTC just declined to prosecute. So they if they did the right thing in the head of my view,
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.840]   and they did the right thing if that's your point of view. I'm not, by the way, in that camp,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.600]   but if that's your point of view, they did the right thing. So it's ridiculous to say they don't
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   understand search. Apparently they do. Well, maybe those lawyers doing that report didn't.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.080]   That's important. Yes. But I don't think that's accurate. I think that there are different ways
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.640]   to look at this. And it depends on your point of view. And ultimately, I think it comes down to
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.840]   whether you trust Google or not. And if you give Google's statements credibility, then you'll say,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.920]   well, okay, that makes sense. But I think you can also interpret the actions in a more
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.560]   negative fashion now. And I put where my lines are. And with appropriate proof, I said these
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.920]   are lines that have Google crossed and they will be wrong. I think we don't know. I think we don't
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.280]   know. I think we don't know. It's a calm down to do you trust Google and what Google has said.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah, what they say makes sense. Whether it's true. I don't know. It's a very self-serving
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   statement. Here's the other part of Leo is that when I was here in all week, and this is just me,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.640]   is that the world, you know, all around Germans and Americans, man, oh, your German's better eat
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.320]   crow. Don't look at this. What the FTC said, well, look on the journal about a German's better
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.080]   eat crow. Google's evil. Google's run. Google's me broken up. I don't see that. But that's part of
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.640]   the problem here of where welcome to the internet, Jeff. I don't think that's what a sense of a person
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.920]   saying. Here's obvious sense of a person. There were some there were some well-known journalists
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.000]   and and media executives were saying I don't I wouldn't say Jeff Jarvis to the crow. What I would
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.560]   say is the FTC did the process worked. The FTC did a reasonable thing. Whether it's right, I don't
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.680]   know a reasonable thing based on the all the reports they received and it looks as if they got
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:29.600]   good information. I'm glad the Wall Street Journal published this report because I think it's important
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.400]   to know the full fact. I would like to I would like it all as the hundred and if
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.280]   bothers me, the other thing feels this should not be in public view because it should be all of it.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.720]   Well, I don't know what the normal process is on on on staff reports. I have no idea. But once
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   the journal has a journal, let's be why isn't the journal putting up the entire I don't know either
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.440]   about that. So I want to see it all. And I think that that's a reasonable thing because this isn't
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.120]   this is a discussion that is appropriate. Don't you feel an appropriate discussion?
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.840]   You want Danny Sullivan to lose sleep for the next week.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   The other thing I would say is we yell at Comcast because Comcast isn't just in the internet
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.800]   business. It's in the TV business. It's in the content creation business. It's in the
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.880]   telephony business. I know I don't yell at Comcast for that Leo. But I just well, I do because it
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:25.360]   muddies the waters. I understand we live in that what I want is not reasonable in the society we
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.120]   live in that businesses in this society have free reign and they have free reign and or any
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.720]   area they wish and compete and compete vigorously. That's a free market. But I do believe that we
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.280]   are in a situation where some companies are starting to dominate. I think Google is dominant. I would
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.320]   feel much better about this if Google had two or three equal competitors just as I'd feel much
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.480]   better at Comcast if they were seeing that they are getting they are starting. Yes, I think that's
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.760]   very important. Two things. One reason I would love to see and I would love to see a search engine.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:02.000]   I don't mind if they sell ad results. That's fine. They've got to monetize. But that's what
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.720]   they do. They do search and add results and they leave it at that. I would love to see that.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:16.240]   Because a search engine has a higher mission. It's so important for it to be a early,
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:23.200]   early, free market business. Here's why I disagree with that. Because then if you separate as someone
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:30.000]   what to do, if you separate search from, let's say, Maps, then the map company doesn't know my
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   searches and doesn't know that I like often looking for pizza where I am and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.400]   That connection to personal data matters. I spend all my time now arguing to the media business.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.320]   They've got to get in the relationship business. They've got to get their own first party data.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.840]   And they've got to start giving people relevance in the manner that Google does.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.600]   Well, you just chopped off the relevance engine. Well, I do. I think there's a societal cost.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.440]   What a fence around them. I think there's a societal. I understand. And I think there's a
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:03.680]   societal cost to that convenience. And I prefer, I would prefer to see many smaller, more narrowly
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:09.760]   focused businesses than giant businesses that are using the interrelationships between the
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.360]   different arms of their business in a synergistic way that is often to our disadvantage.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.560]   And yes, we'd be giving up some great stuff like Google now. I think that's a fair trade.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.800]   I think that we'd be in a better world if we had many small businesses.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.920]   Here's the other problem. I'm competing against each other.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.320]   The other argument I heard from my European friends particularly was, and I had an hour
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.520]   long conversation with our Austrian journalist about this time. And it's, well, they could do
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.440]   this. They could do that. Just because you could do something is not, unless your Tom Cruise with
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.240]   a big screen in front of you, that is not cause for legal action. It's what you actually do.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.120]   I agree. That matters. And I think that we're, there's too much going on here that says,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.440]   Google's too big. Well, again, show me the law that says too big. Show me the show,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.560]   we're the line is there. Absolutely. They're absolutely within their rights and the great
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.000]   American tradition of free enterprise. I'm not saying it's, it should be against the law.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.120]   I'm just saying it would be nice aesthetically. And I think that, I think that the thing that
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.600]   has to be mentioned is the fact that we're moving to a world of relying on virtual
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.840]   assistants for a lot of answers, and they don't give you results. They just give you answers.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.560]   And you don't know where it came from. And it's like, you know, talk to Siri and say,
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.720]   Hey, Siri, what's the deal with XYZ? And it says, here's the answer. Apple has intentionally
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.960]   where did that come from? Cut the head off of that result. They don't want it to say Google.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.760]   And so that's very important. There is competition growing. We have a story in the run down today,
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.400]   business insider, and it's typically blunt way saying that, you know, as Larry Page,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:47.520]   asleep at the switch, Google should be scared to death of Facebook. Facebook's not nearly as big
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:52.560]   as Google yet, but it is making huge inroads. And I want to remind you of the days when certain
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.080]   parties thought that Microsoft was going to take over the world. And now Microsoft is darned
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.320]   near a laughing stock, except on your show, because they're nice to them. It's just nice to them.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.240]   I don't know. I think in Windows weekly, we spent a lot of time going on. What is it? You do. You do.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:13.680]   I just got a joke. I'm sorry. You know, this is a great conversation. And I completely see your
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.800]   point of view. And I yours. We just disagree. Yeah, I don't even know if we disagree.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:28.320]   I fear a company where those synergies are so massive that we become little cogs in their data
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.720]   machine. Is it possible? But here's the question, Leo, because somebody went after me, somebody who's
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.800]   a Google hater went after me when I said that I think Google's basically a good company.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.720]   Oh, Google. Apologist. I don't know. I agree with you. I think they are a good company.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.160]   Well, but that's the quote. Yeah, well, that's part of the question. I think there are those who
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.840]   think that companies, you know, Stephen Vadonathian, who I respect greatly, just says companies must
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.480]   be companies. And basically they're going to I don't want to I'm going to I'm so merciful via
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.200]   Stephen. I don't want to do that. But that there are those who would say companies will inevitably
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.400]   go bad, be wrong, be corrupt. Can we believe in the possibility of a good company?
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.120]   And I still hold out the idea that we can, because if we don't, if we can't,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.720]   then yeah, you you reflexively regulate everything, but you then limit the upside of the world that's
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.920]   being created. And and that's I know I sound like a libertarian. I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.880]   I'm I'm a liberal. I believe there's need for government in many cases, but I don't believe in
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:32.080]   reflexive regulation. You know, I think we all agree on that. Oh, a lot don't. A lot. But I do
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.480]   feel like there's such power in nowadays in a search engine like people to be the arbiter of
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:46.720]   fact to its curation. And I think they should be a I would love to see an order, a priesthood
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:54.800]   that would would hold as its highest goal to do the best job at that as possible. And of course,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.840]   if that's their highest goal, then they wouldn't get into side businesses that, you know,
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.440]   you maximize profit by getting this. So use use use duct duct, make them a nonprofit.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:13.440]   Oh God, communist. Well, I think there are some things. Go go each. I don't want to. I think there's
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.560]   I think there are some things. The roads are a good example. The roads should be nationalized.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.360]   They shouldn't be run by private business because otherwise you get interlocking toll roads and
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:29.760]   you get all sorts of horrible things happening. There are certain things that work best if they
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:40.560]   are not held by a for profit and ever with speech. Never. That is a first amendment violation speech
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:47.440]   search is speech, dammit. And if you then do that, because hey, that's exactly what, you know,
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.360]   China wants. Yeah, we'll control the search for your own good. I don't mean government run. I mean,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:58.240]   nonprofit like nonprofits are any better. No, I'm sorry. I mean, well, I think that if you I know
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.880]   plenty of nonprofits that are that are that are greatly compromised because of where their money
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.960]   comes from. You'd also have to suppress speech in the sense that if you had, let's say, for example,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.520]   they have the right to do this. I'm not. But what I'm saying is there are market forces here and
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.240]   there there. You know, there's there's how reality works. If Google were suddenly handed over to a
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.080]   nonprofit organization, it would suddenly halt in its tracks because nonprofits are very, very slow.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.800]   And then some nimble startup would come out of Stanford and everybody would gravitate toward it
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.920]   and you'd either be back to Google again with with a private company making these decisions.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.720]   Or you'd be saying we have a law saying you can't have a search engine. I understand what I'm
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.280]   proposing is not practical. I completely understand. I know you're being provocative. I'm not even
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   being provocative. I think this would be the I think we need a society of Jesuits who are
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   positive single goal, which is to curate to provide a good search that is not tainted by
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.960]   appearance or fact of competition. It would solve also this privacy issue. You know, people are worried
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.240]   about Google. The more these synergies happen, the more Google knows about you, it scares people.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.000]   All of those would go away because Google wouldn't need to know anything about you.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.400]   You know what you're doing, Leo? You're you're erasing Gutenberg. You're going back to the scribes.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.120]   You want you want scribal search not in every respect. But in one and yeah, if you're going to give a
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:28.080]   company the right to curate, the right to arbitrate fact, it's become such a powerful thing. Yeah,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:33.120]   I feel like I know it's not going to happen. The bottom line is that number one, there's no
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:39.840]   such thing as a as valueless search results or content. You a search engine company has its
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.960]   corporate values. Those are not going to be in line with anybody else's values. Yours mind,
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   anybody's and the second horrible reality is that any sort of NSD that has a search engine,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.600]   somebody has to do it. Somebody has to. Is the government the right one? No, is it is a bunch
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.280]   of Jesuits? I don't know about that. You know, there's always a B.E.E. somebody. I understand.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.000]   There's always a point of view. So that's why the next best thing is to have true competition.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.640]   And I while you might say, Oh, yeah, well, we got Bing and we got Bing.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.480]   There's not competition. So I'll go back to Altavista.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:20.000]   There is not competition in search. And the default is Google. And I don't know where these
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.720]   market share numbers come from because no one I know uses anything but Google.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:30.560]   One good thing is that it's not universal. So for example, in Russia, Yandex is bigger search
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:36.400]   engine than Google. It's just in the US. Well, US isn't even nearly as bad as it is in Europe.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:43.840]   It's like 93% or more or something like that. US is much better. 63 or something like that.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.920]   Yeah. But there's a lot of people. Well, but it's the same reason as why is Yahoo still
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.840]   alone? Why is AOL still around? Because people have habits that go way, way back.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.760]   And that's where we're not like that. You try every darn new thing down the pike.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.720]   But that's not go a true competitor. No, it's not.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.080]   You know, being an AOL and Yahoo are together. And yeah, but but but Dr.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.680]   goes not where does that goes? Where do their results come from?
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.960]   They come from other search engines, right? Yeah, because they keep saying they're going to
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.400]   make a crawler. I don't know if that's viable. No, she another way to look at this is a whole
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:28.560]   different way to look at this is you could argue that what Google should open source is the crawl.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.840]   The crawl data. Okay. And let others build on top of that.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.000]   I like that. Let others be the curators. What I buy. So what I'm buying from Google when I'm
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.480]   with my time and my situation is their point is there is the value they are added.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.680]   I like this idea. Parchiality they're adding in. This is analogous to the idea of let
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.360]   the municipalities create the infrastructure for an internet, but let 100 companies on top of it
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:03.040]   provide the internet access. I like that idea. Again, and something that's never going to happen
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.920]   because that is the crown jewel. But if you were France and Germany when they were trying to
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.000]   create their own Google, they were trying. Well, there's a couple of things here. One,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.560]   they were trying to create the wrong thing. Two, I would argue once again, the monopolies not in
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.680]   search, the monopolies in advertising. Right. That's what nobody looks at. Except it is in
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.800]   search because the crawl data is impossible to duplicate. Yeah, but it's all known to be on that.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.600]   It's now just a marketplace because the search data doesn't really greatly affect
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.200]   double click the way it does search ads and double click is a huge part of the business.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.280]   And video ads aren't really affected in search results. So no, Google's monopoly is in digital
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.400]   advertising. Well, if that's the case, that's good news because they as you point out Facebook
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.560]   and others are giving or running for their money. So if that's the case, but I feel like it's not
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.600]   the case because I feel like they have what they have really is the index of the internet.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:05.040]   And that is so hard to duplicate. No, I don't think it's the it's not
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.520]   it's not the raw data about the internet. It's not the screen saying it's the information they
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:16.400]   have about us. It's relevance. It's the experience data. Yeah. So what? But even that, even that,
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:22.000]   again, I don't think that's the monopoly. Oh, yeah. Let's take a break. I think it's a
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.120]   great conversation. And I don't think there's an answer to it. And I actually think the FTC
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.440]   did the right thing after looking at all this analysis. But I'm also glad that I maybe don't go
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.520]   as far as you do is saying this is a hit piece by Rupert Murdoch. I think it's appropriate for
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:41.280]   the journal. I want to see well, you know, it's published at all Wall Street Journal.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.640]   I'm just saying and I don't want to be a spurge Wall Street Journal,
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.680]   Journalist, the Journalist, the Wall Street Journal. I think they're working as it works.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:56.160]   But they are affected by I think one must judge some things in the light of the ongoing
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.200]   never ending attacks on Google. I think have an impact on how we judge that.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.520]   Yeah, but you know what? Real people don't care. They just say, what's the best search engine?
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.840]   Actually, they don't even say that. Right. They don't know what they're doing. They just type it
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.520]   in the hole in the top of the browser and whatever happens, whatever comes out, that's what they use.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.240]   That's real. What is the back end? That's the power of the power of theory in terms of the search
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.280]   results. It's a variety of things, including Google, Wolfram, Alpha, Wikipedia. And they have a
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.400]   tendency to try to get rid of Google as much as possible. No, I think they use Google. What
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:38.480]   they have a tendency to do is to strip the name Google. If I were Google, I'd be a lot more
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.640]   incensed about what Apple's doing to them than when other companies are saying about a Google
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:49.280]   doing to them. March is National Business Month. So get going. It's business time.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:55.680]   We're brought to you today by LegalZoom.com. If you're thinking about starting a business,
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.320]   well, it's going to be a better time. National Start Your Business Month. And at LegalZoom.com,
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.280]   they're celebrating. It's never been easier to build your future. LegalZoom provides all the
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.160]   support you need, as it did for me 10 years ago when I started my business. In fact, that's
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.000]   about what they've been doing it for just a little bit longer than that. And they've helped a million
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:23.840]   business owners, just like me, get started with LLCs or S or C Corps, doing their trademark. We got
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:29.680]   two trademarks. It was very easy. You did not need a lawyer for that. I just need a LegalZoom. And
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.480]   that's good because LegalZoom is not a law firm. They just help you get stuff done at your direction.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.720]   However, here's a good thing. If you do need advice for your business, no problem.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.520]   They're not a law firm. You're not going to a building with 100 lawyers in it. What they've done,
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.880]   though, is build a network of independent, trusted attorneys that will provide the guidance you need
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.040]   for your specific situation. And you can choose that attorney based not only on their profile,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.480]   but on the edited reviews from LegalZoom customers. And here's the best part. During National Start
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:05.200]   Your Business Month, LegalZoom is offering an attorney consultation for $50. My attorney,
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:10.400]   as soon as he answers the phone, $50. I don't have one word. That's 100 bucks. Two words, 300 bucks.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   50 bucks. If you're unsure about the best way to start it. And by the way, I'm not knocking my
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.160]   attorney. I'm just saying it's expensive. If you're unsure about the best way to start it,
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.400]   if you already run a business and you need some advice, this offers for you. Get legal advice for
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:30.000]   your business with no further obligation for a low one-time cost. They do wills too. I highly
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.640]   recommend this. A power medical attorney, if you don't have one, you got to get one a medical
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:40.400]   directive. The wills and all that stuff on LegalZoom are far less expensive even than on better call
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.880]   Saul. And he's a bottom of the barrel attorney. And he's as cheap as you can get. I've only seen
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.360]   the two episodes that I'm loving. Go to LegalZoom.com today. Find out more attorney consultations
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.680]   are provided by independent attorneys available. Most dates get the legal help you need for your

[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:13.120]   please use the offer code TWI. Gee, Mike Elkins here. Love having you here. Appreciate
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:19.200]   your coming earlier this morning. Love the show. We were at the Facebook F8 conference.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:26.000]   That's right. It's in Zuck on stage. He killed the buffalo on stage. It was amazing. Did he eat it?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.920]   Yes, he did. He ate as much as he could. He had blood all over his face. It was horrible.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.560]   It is clear when you watch Facebook that they have ambitions far beyond that of the social network.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.640]   They want to be an alternative internet, basically. Yeah, you know, it really looked like they want
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:46.000]   to be AOL. Yes, that's right. Like you go into Facebook at the beginning of the day and everything
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.320]   is within there. When they send me a disc, I'm done. You're dumb canceling my Facebook account.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:55.520]   They did announce. Well, so last year at F8, this is their developers conference. By the way,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:01.040]   we will continue to cover it tomorrow. The second keynote, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time,
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.200]   1700 UTC, Mike and I will be here. It's going to be, we think, the Oculus Rift stuff.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:12.400]   Virtual reality. The R helmet stuff. But today, what they were talking about wasn't as revolutionary
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:19.200]   as last year. It was really kind of the same stuff. But the idea that Facebook's motto is very
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:28.080]   famously, what does it work fast and break things or something like that? Go fast and break things.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.600]   Get drunk and break things. Last year, Zuck said, well, what we really do is, our new motto is,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.560]   go fast and provide a stable infrastructure. Which is not the same thing. He's older now.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.680]   Yes, that's eight. And that's what happens when you hit 30. But for developers, that's kind of
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.200]   what they want to hear. And so it was really about a developer platform. But the one thing
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.120]   that is kind of interesting, though, this whole year has been about deconstructing Facebook,
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.720]   taking the big blue page and turning it into slices of apps like Messenger and WhatsApp and
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:06.240]   Instagram and I think more are coming all the time. This was a little bit in the opposite direction.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:11.280]   They wanted to say, Messenger is a platform. The platform was the big word they kept saying
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.160]   again and again. And they showed Messenger integration features, the ability for you as a
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:22.880]   developer to create an app that worked with Messenger. They showed jib jib and it becomes a part of
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.240]   the Messenger and extends Messenger in effect. Yeah, which who wants that? I didn't want it.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:36.080]   But it seems to me that they want to their whole multiple app strategy. And again, I've said
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:41.600]   before, I think they're going to have more than 100 apps with a year or two. They want to get
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.000]   everybody as occupied with Facebook stuff as possible. If anybody's going to do anything else,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.480]   they're going to do Snapchat or anything like they want to get in front of it. They want to get,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.560]   you know, sort of capture that behavior and get people doing it on it. Now, my guess is that
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.200]   even today, a huge number of people use Instagram, either don't know or don't care that that's a
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:06.560]   Facebook product. They just like Instagram and this fine with Facebook. It doesn't even look like
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:13.600]   a Facebook. It doesn't seem to have any connections. But here, Facebook is the one that has a monopoly
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:19.760]   on our relationships. One can argue it's the most common, right? 1.4 billion users.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.920]   Google gets crap all over about tying the relationship database it has across its applications.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.600]   Facebook doesn't. Right. And I don't know if they should, but it's interesting to me that
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:37.840]   that's what makes this powerful as a Facebook knows you across WhatsApp and messenger and Facebook.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.520]   Well, and the only thing they need to know is that it's used so they can serve you ads, right?
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.400]   And also harvest your personal data and behavior. I mean, they have something called moves. I don't
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.280]   know if you've ever used this, but basically it automatically tracks your, how much you're running
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.200]   and biking and all that kind of stuff. But also where you go. So if you look at your day,
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.400]   it says, "Oh, you were at Starbucks for 22 minutes." But Google's been doing that for years.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:04.400]   Yes, yes. But this is an interesting thing that now Facebook can take that sort of location data
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.880]   and they can apply to advertising on messenger, for example, or some other location.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.440]   So you have an ad network that's across all the platforms and you have data aggregation across
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.960]   all the platforms. That's powered by that. Which again, I'm arguing that rather than trying to kill
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.040]   all that going on, what I argue to my media confreres is, get in that game, people.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.400]   We'll talk in a few minutes probably about Facebook and news. And this has been my
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.960]   sermon on that point. But aren't you sitting on top of
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.680]   sand because really ultimately, if you build your business on Facebook,
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.720]   their interest is not you, it's them. Yes, but it depends upon the deal.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   I think that the idea that we have to continually drive people to us at our sites,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.640]   that goes away, especially in a mobile world, we're going to have to go to where people are.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.960]   So the art of this, I would argue, is what deal Facebook does. And I've talked with Facebook about
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.680]   this. And I wrote a post before all these announcements and leaks saying, here's my wish list of what
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.280]   I wish Facebook would do for news. And then when there's word from the New York Times that they
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.000]   are talking to news organizations, my message is very simple. It's not sufficient to put your
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.480]   content up on Facebook to get branding. Good. It's not sufficient to put there to get links.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.760]   It is a help to get revenue. Facebook should start sharing revenue for those cases. That would be a
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.800]   good thing. But that's not neither is that a business model. What you need to get is data.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.360]   Now, the yes, but I get from everywhere is, well, about privacy. My argument is very simple that
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.600]   when you make, if the user makes a transactional agreement saying that I want to share this data,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.560]   so I get this relevance back, then it works. So the example I give is Facebook and say,
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.400]   well, Jeff, we see that you follow the jets a lot. So you can make fun of your friend Jim Brady and
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.440]   your poor son, who is a fan of the jets. And we see you care about this topic. And we also see that
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.640]   you follow and J.com a lot in the Guardian a lot and they cover those topics. Would you like us to
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.120]   alert them to alert you when things that are relevant happen? And I can say yes or no. And if I
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   say yes, I've now given permission for that data about me, that information about me to pass across,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.800]   because I'm going to get relevance back. The same as I do on ways when it weighs,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.200]   knows where I live and where I work. And I get relevance back from that. I think it is possible
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.360]   to construct things on Facebook that will give media companies the data they don't have. Now,
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.640]   the problem is, you know, once they have it, well, they know what to do with it, probably not.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.480]   But that's what we have to fix in my business, because we're still in the mass business where
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.800]   all we do is give anonymous faceless eyeballs messages. That business is commodified. The value
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.440]   will go to zero. We have to go to the relevance. And there's various ways to do relevance.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.640]   This show your shows are one way to do relevance. You target the content extremely. Another way to
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.720]   do it is what Facebook and Google do. I don't know that Facebook's going to give any data across.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.680]   So what I say to media companies is if they do do the deal, you're building your own business,
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.600]   you're learning more about your consumers than you have learned in the last 20 years,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.440]   go for it. If they don't, yes, sand is on your feet.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.920]   But I don't see any evidence for first of all, I wouldn't lump Facebook and Google into the same
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:14.160]   cat. They are categorically in the same scenario. But what they, you know, I don't trust Facebook.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.400]   I mean, we were watching the announcement today and they flat out said,
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   oh, this is a great kind of advertisement because users can't tell the difference between
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.560]   the add the video ads and the regular videos. That's why it's so good. That's why it's so powerful.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.480]   Like the whole industry is going through that problem, native advertising.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.280]   Okay, but I agree. There's something provably shameless about Facebook. If you recall the
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.080]   advertisements that they used to have where they were clearly ads and they labeled them in a
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.400]   misleading way to make you think that they weren't ads and they called sponsored posts or
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.000]   recommended. I think they're called them. So I did. I did a test, Mike. I went to, I took
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.600]   a screenshot. This is of a medium today on if you can find it quickly. I took us a screenshot
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.200]   from Upworthy, which has a little box and it says the word promoted on it. And I went to Google
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.240]   and I paid 50 bucks for Google consumer surveys. And I asked people what does promoted mean
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.320]   in this context? Does it mean that an advertiser promoted it that the editor is promoted it that
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.560]   the reader is promoted or an algorithm? Yeah, 44% got it right, which is to say that the majority
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.280]   got it wrong. The majority didn't know it was an ad. Yeah. How about this one?
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.520]   And suggested post. Yeah. What does that mean? Right. Who suggested it?
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.080]   Who suggested that? Facebook's advertiser. Well, you know, and this is the thing that bugs me and
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:42.320]   Facebook likes to brag about how how much more videos are being played on Facebook. The reason
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:49.200]   they are is they treat their algorithm as well. They're put their censoring more stuff that is
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.040]   not videos from and keeping it from coming into your newsfeed. And they're pushing videos,
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.320]   these trivial like inane videos and they're pushing those and then they're auto playing as you point
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.360]   it out. And they're saying, look at all these people. They love video. Well, I just don't trust
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.080]   Facebook. I think they tweak these algorithms for the reasons. And we're had a long discussion about
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.040]   about whether Google was being anti competitive and how they tweak their algorithms and show product
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:21.680]   information. I just think Facebook is just shameless about how they push things in the newsfeeds.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.560]   They have total power. They've admitted they admitted last F a conference that they only push
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:34.320]   from business pages. What was it? 12% or something like every business learned that this is not a
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:41.760]   tiny number actually make it into people's newsfeeds. And so this really bugs me. And I just don't think
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.400]   it's even in the same ballpark as what Google does with their algorithms. I think it was a mistake
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.160]   for Facebook. I think it's still true on the right that you do get the raw feed of everything that
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.120]   goes into your feed, right? I think the Facebook should make that extremely accessible. So you can
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.200]   just you'll decide which is better for you. And I think most people will decide that the Facebook
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.760]   curated feed is better, except they'll never do that. They'll never do that. Yeah, even scoble,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.840]   because I did observe that in Facebook that if I go to the chronological order as opposed to
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.160]   the newsfeed that I would get everything and he said, oh, you don't want to do that.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.480]   He said, well, and you know, I think in some respects, this might be the right answer. You want
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.200]   to give Facebook enough signals so that their algorithm can give you a feed of something you really
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:30.240]   will like. So when you go to newsfeed, you can click the, you know, the selector. I don't
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.600]   I doubt anybody much knows that this and you can either do top stories or most recent. If you do
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:41.840]   most recent, yeah, you're getting everything. But no one does that. And and and scoble's point was
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.240]   just, you know, spend hours teaching Facebook, which you like and you'll love it.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:53.200]   Hundreds of hours. I cannot. I am I would and by the way, here, see, I don't really want this.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.520]   Now this is sponsored before I had another one that says, well, I like sponsored. I know
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.880]   and this video auto played. And so, you know, of course I'm watching this video. No, I'm not.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.840]   That's bogus. I'd like to know how many videos were clicked on Facebook, not how many videos were
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.880]   played. I just I can't wait to get rid of Facebook. I really can. You go so back and forth on that.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.600]   So no, I don't. I've never wanted Facebook. I only have to have it. Because how else do we have
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.200]   this conversation? Right. I have to have it. I don't want to have it. And I don't really get
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.680]   any cut anything coming in. But here's the love that now let's say let's assume Lisa is kind of
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.200]   a normal person. She's married. Maybe she's kind of a normal person. She loves it. I keep saying
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.440]   this to her. She says, no, this is like, see all my friends. I have a great time. She looks at it
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.800]   all the time loves it. Nobody likes it. She likes her friends horrible after I look at it. I don't
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:52.160]   ever feel good. The fact that Facebook is talking to big publishers, this is the ego of us big
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.280]   publishers, publishers talking or in my world. But I think that's that's a hopeful sign that
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.600]   they're looking for quality content that they've realized that crap doesn't pay.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:10.480]   Put that on your badge. And that's the problem. And then they just as Google had to learn about
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.200]   being gained, Facebook has had to learn about being gained by the up for these and then right.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.280]   But you know, they seem to learn. I don't see a lot of that anymore. Yeah. And I think that they're
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.440]   trying to go for more quality in the feed and not everybody wants to New York Times, but those who
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.000]   do, it'd be a better experience. So the analog though to what we were talking about in the last
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.360]   segment because they've now become a curation type engine. I mean, they really are telling me
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   what's real and what's they're telling you who your relationships are and which of your relationships
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.520]   are irrelevant. Yeah, you don't need to talk to that person. I don't really want them to do that.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.640]   No. But I also hope Springs eternal as soon as Mark's talk talking about how great messenger is,
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:55.120]   I reinstalled it because I take a Facebook off all of my devices. Should I reinstalk on Android?
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.080]   It was driving me. It will drive you even more berserk. For instance, one of the things they
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:08.560]   pitched to F8 was if you're a brand, you should have a push me notifications on messenger button
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:13.680]   on the checkout on the on the cart so that you can interact because it was all you have to all
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.040]   the user has to do is click that probably even logged in through Facebook. So easy peasy and then
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.800]   all of a sudden the brand's going to be messaging you with like your shoes are on the way. Oh,
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.760]   those shoes are great. They look good on you. You want to buy another pair of shoes? Hey,
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.920]   you bought shoes last week. You want more shoes? Would you like some shoes? I don't want that.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.680]   That's just stupidity. That makes messenger less useful, not more useful to me.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.120]   Right. But what's the fix to that? I mean, I always go to Amazon. I'm not going to click that button.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.040]   The story I always tell is that is that when I buy my daughter Taylor Swift album, the next day
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.920]   I'm a dirty old man on Amazon, what does Amazon do? It gives me visibility to that data and the
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:54.640]   chance to change it. And that's what Google, well, Google does it somewhat often in its
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.440]   dashboard. Amazon probably knows enough about me that to be bugging me all the time and has the
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:08.320]   good sense. Thank you, Amazon. I do get emails from and you can opt out of this from Amazon saying,
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:16.080]   hey, you bought the Xcopter. Somebody is wondering if that Xcopter uses batteries. Would you like to
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.240]   answer that? Really? That's very annoying. Yeah, that's annoying. That's really annoying. But
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:29.760]   I turned that off. Yeah, no, Amazon, I think Amazon pays attention to signals. The difference is
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.160]   Amazon is not in the business selling advertising. Right. And they're better at it. I've never really
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   seen a lot of accurate contextual advertising on Facebook. Whereas on Amazon, it's really good.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.480]   That was the other lie on the F8 stage. Deborah Liu comes out and says, you know,
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:52.400]   not only do customers like native advertising in their content, but they love it that we only
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:58.320]   show them ads they like. That's right. What? Not in my feed. I'm still getting ads for barbed
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:07.440]   wire fences and 60 year old men in Petaluma. Here I see I'm looking at an ad men suits at Nordstrom.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.240]   Leo, have you ever seen me wear a suit? Never. But Facebook thinks you do.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.760]   Facebook knows you should. Mike. Yeah. I see actually the day Mark Zuckerberg looks pretty
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.400]   good in the suit, don't you? Mike is a whole theoretical nanny. That he never gonna happen.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.520]   American Express gold car. Yeah. Yeah. Got that. But see, we both have. We're big spenders.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.440]   This is just TV advertising. It's time because they should know I have that.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.280]   But it's like it's TV advertising. We're both getting the same ad. There's what's contextual
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.000]   about that, Leo. Right. There's showing everybody the American Express gold. They no longer say
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.320]   58 year old men in Petaluma are very interested in these toasters because that was annoying.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.960]   All right. There's lots more to talk about than this dumb stuff. Let's let's talk about
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.600]   cool stuff. Eric Schmidt says Google's not giving up on glass. You're a glass hole.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.840]   I'm a glass hole. Yes. And the fact that the fact.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.240]   Or glass hole reformed glass hole. This is a perfect example of the of the
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.680]   tech journalist echo chamber creating a lie in the public consciousness. The idea that they
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.640]   were retiring it was pure wishful thinking. And here's the proof. I do wish. Basically what Google
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.720]   said was that they were going to take glass and they're going to take it out of the experimental
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.160]   phase out of Google X and they're going to create a product division and develop it into a consumer
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:31.200]   product. And everybody said it's dead. Now that is the biggest leap you can imagine. They did exactly
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.600]   the same thing with their project that maps indoor location. Right. Exactly the same thing.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.400]   They could and everybody said, Oh, look, it's the future. They're going to do this thing. They're
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.600]   going to make a real product. So this whole thing that Google Glass was dead and they were killing
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.240]   it off was a fabrication by the tech media. Okay.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.560]   Pure and simple. But really they should kill it off. No, no, you know what they should do. I said
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.760]   this before, but say it again. They should offer every poor glass hole. The opportunity for a refund.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.880]   Your money back. Well, what the how many people how many glass buyers would ask for Jason? You'd
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.560]   ask for your money back. I believe I'd be asking for your money back and I wish you would. Jeff,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.840]   you'd be asking for your money back. But I guess this guy over here, Mike, you wouldn't want your
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.680]   money back? No, I wouldn't. And here's what they should do to make Google Glass. The whole problem
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.840]   was caused by the camera because the idea of holding up a phone is something nobody ever does.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.520]   Oh, wait, no, everybody does it every day. Miracat. But what they should do is that the
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.320]   camera on Google Glass should be removable so that we can get the notifications. We can get
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.800]   the information as we're walking around and not be pointing a camera. I think nobody would object
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.560]   to it. I think it's the opposite. It should just be a camera. On my watch now, I'm getting the
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.920]   notifications and the instructions. I don't need it here. Yes. Well, I do want a point of view camera,
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.560]   but it should very simple red light on it. Yeah. All it needs is a red light to what it's like.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.360]   Really? Do you guys were you satisfied with the camera? Because you have to aim like it's like
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.920]   looking at what your eye is looking at. But they thought it was okay. It was very wide angle lens.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.120]   So you didn't otherwise you would see if you're if you're in the men's room and you're trying to
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.920]   take pictures of people in the men's room, it's really easy to do. Just kidding. But but but but
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.480]   the the wearable jump is so small. The wearable can be well it's only because it's a wide
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:21.760]   angle. It's so far away. It's wide angle. But but the wearable computing revolution is coming and
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.640]   we're going to be able to just know things and Google Glass is a great way to just know things.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.960]   Really? You found it useful because I feel like that screen of over my eyebrow was too small and
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.320]   too difficult to look at to be really useful. I think there's other ways to do that. I think
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.800]   there are other ways and that may not be the best way to do it. But I do think that I like augmented
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.800]   reality. Yeah. I mean, well, that's what Google Glass theoretically could be. No, not at all. I mean,
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.840]   really all it is is a monitor over your eyebrow. No, but if it's contextual and you the initial
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.640]   remember the initial initial fake video of Google Glass. Yeah. You got walked around and you got
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.520]   key information. Oh, your friend wants to do this. Well, that was for wait a minute reality. You know
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.560]   what? You know what FTC was go after him for fraud on Google Glass. Yeah, that had that video.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.640]   Yeah, do that. Yep. Okay. Quartz says Google's driverless car. This probably is another
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:18.000]   journalist getting something wrong might come with airbags on the outside to protect pedestrians.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.360]   I think it should come with springs that push the pedestrians further away.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:31.600]   This can't be possibly be true. It can't be. It can't possibly be true out of my way,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.280]   pedestrian. This comes from a patent application that's meaningless. Sorry, quartz.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.800]   A people patent everything. We enjoyed it. It's a good it's a good laugh. I do like this. Now,
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.760]   I am the only person in the world who likes Google's inbox app. But I think if you start to
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.040]   think about it as a new platform for Google to integrate mail into other things, this makes a
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.800]   lot of sense. They're working on a project to let you receive bills in Gmail and pay them.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.840]   It's called Pony Express. That's a strange name, but it is. And maybe this is going to kill the
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:20.080]   USPS. I love this idea. Yeah. So they use a third party company to verify your identity. And this
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:25.040]   is another thing that I think is being underplayed in the report on this. Yes. Google essentially
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.800]   gave up on Google Pluses and Identity Platform. They got rid of their real names policy and all
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.320]   the rest. And now it's not your identity. Now they're talking about a third party company
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.760]   that will really verify your identity. Not Google. Not Google. It's a third party company.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.920]   Do we know the company? No, no. It's a theoretical company at this point.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.480]   But this is how it would work. Right. So they would really know who you are in the way that
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.720]   financial companies and people who you pay your bills to would be able to identify you as. But
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.480]   once they know who you are, once the Google system, the Google password is associated with a really
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.840]   solid identity, there you go. They've got identity. That's a really, really good point, Mike.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.680]   Yeah. They always say about how Apple has all those credit cards. Yeah. This would be better than
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.280]   that. Yep. And imagine if they tied in a wallet, they already have. It might be something as simple
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.880]   as linking to your wallet account. But yeah. So this is a document that the recode
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:32.800]   got that says it'll come in the fourth quarter. May or may not be called Pony Express in the
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:39.840]   real world. That could just be a code name. But boy, I love, you know, this is an example of,
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.800]   I love my Google overlords. Yeah. Because man, the data they get, everything.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.000]   Yeah. And of course, they're speculating. I think that was Kurt Wagner who wrote that,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.480]   they would use the data for contextual advertising. They could use the data for additional financial
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:03.440]   services, including getting loans and things like that. So you get your visa bill,
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.520]   that visa bill is itemized. Yeah. It's Google going to analyze the itemization. Yeah. Why not?
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.960]   Ooh, fine. You know, I mean, they're already companies like our advertiser personal capital
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:21.760]   that do that until it's mint does that. Yeah. And again, this is if you look at how they do ads
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.440]   right now on Gmail, it's basically they read the content of your, of your messages and say,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.920]   oh, you're talking about scuba diving. You need this regulator or whatever. I mean,
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.040]   theoretical, better yet, you just bought a wetsuit. But do you have the tanks or better yet? We're
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.680]   looking at your bank account. You got a lot of money. You want to be considered a
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.840]   a driving car with airbags on the outside.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:52.320]   From the Washington Post, a story that came out this morning, the nation's top technology firms
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.200]   and a coalition of privacy groups will be sending a letter to the Obama administration and senior
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:05.840]   lawmakers suggesting that Congress place curbs on government surveillance, apparently the deadline
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:12.480]   for Patriot Act expiration June 1st is rapidly approaching. But the effective date really is
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.040]   the day Congress goes home for Memorial Day recess, which is sooner in May 21st.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   The letter says, quote, the status quo is untenable and it is urgent that Congress move forward
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:31.520]   with reform. The Reform Government Surveillance Industry Coalition includes Apple, Microsoft,
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:37.280]   Twitter, Facebook, and of course, Google. We know that there are some in Congress. This is policy
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   director of the New America Foundations Open Technology Institute. We know there are some in
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:46.480]   Congress who think they can get away with reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act without
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.080]   any reforms at all. This letter draws a line in the sand. It makes it clear the privacy community.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.520]   It's funny that Google considers itself part of the privacy. Yeah. Oh, no, that's another part.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.400]   And the internet industry do not intend to let that happen without a fight. Good. Good on you.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:11.840]   We'll see what happens. Remember that they may 21st Congress recesses. If they're going to
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.160]   reauthorize the Patriot Act, it will have to be before then. And that's the kind of thing you do
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.720]   in a late night session. Yeah. Right. On Christmas Eve, Christmas Eve on a holiday or something.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.640]   Let's see. We did the FTC stuff. Google fibers expanding once again, salt lake city, the next
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:36.080]   candidate, Google fiber plans and experiment. This is an interesting one with targeted ads.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:44.000]   Very TV. They want to make TV ads more like internet ads. You were just saying that American
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.600]   Express had was effectively TV ad you and I got the same ad. Exactly. And so but that's Facebook.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.480]   Of course, Google isn't always all that contextually savvy either. But basically what they're talking
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:00.960]   about is having the ad like there's a moment in the programming where you can put very local
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.680]   advertising. Like literally the store at the end of the street could actually put advertising.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.600]   Came from a visitor are already Comcast does this for instance. Yeah, there's visible world
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.720]   NBC Universal and cable vision and direct TV are doing similar things. This would probably be
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:20.080]   more Google-ish as they'd probably be a little bit better in terms. No, because what happens,
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.800]   you watch an ad block and a TV show something I don't do as I do as little as possible.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.960]   But you watch an ad block and a TV show and starts with the really glitzy high
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.680]   gloss ads from major national companies. And by the end, you're it's better called Saul.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.040]   Yeah, exactly. It's more more local. Exactly. Now, here's the cool part. Even if you DVR it,
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.600]   it'll put a different ad while you're watching the DVR than when you're watching the live. No kidding.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.160]   So it doesn't care if it's recording or live a memory X or whatever. It will always put the
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:56.000]   contextually relevant ad in there. So I don't you know, people hate this idea because they feel
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.040]   like it's an invasion of privacy. It's essentially what we do on Twitter is contextual ads in the
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:09.520]   sense that we're a very targeted service. So the ads we do are targeted at people who would watch
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:15.200]   the kind of crap that we do. So we have ads that are for the most part, I think, of interest to
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.120]   the audience. It's always better, isn't it? To have an ad that's of interest in the audience than an
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.360]   ad for something you don't want. The alternative is an irrelevant ad. You're trying to get an ad.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.800]   I'd rather have an ad I care about. Yeah, I think it's actually argued too that the media
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.680]   companies should have some kind of reward for you. I'll give you if I knew that I were more
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.560]   valuable to the New York Times by giving them 10 demographic points. You might do it. I do it.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.480]   I make more valuable to them. Maybe I get a discount on my subscription as a result. They make
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.440]   more money as a result. And by the way, I get more relevant ads.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.240]   That's why we ask our viewers to help support Twit by going to twit.tv/survey.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.160]   Great.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.040]   SEGWIM. Did you say twit.tv/survey?
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:03.760]   Twit.tv/survey. We do this every year. We do a little survey. Actually, it's not that little.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.080]   How long do you think it takes? Half an hour. Less than that.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.600]   No, five minutes.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.320]   Not even that long. Some of it is for us to understand better what you watch, what you like,
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.920]   how many of you watch video, how many of you watch audio, which shows you watch.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.480]   One of the stats we got from last year, which was very valuable, is how many different shows
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:25.040]   the typical person watches, how many watch just one, how many watch two, how many watch every show
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.520]   we do, you know who you are. But then we also have some demographic information. Please don't
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.800]   be affronted by it. We're not collecting personal information about you at all.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.880]   That will not in any way be linked to you. But what we do want to be able to do is some
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:43.360]   advertisers want to know, well, how many men? Listen, how many women? How many college educated?
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.240]   What's their income, that kind of thing? And we do want to be able to provide that. That gives us,
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:52.720]   I think, better ads to better target what you're interested in. If you don't want to do it,
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:58.240]   you do not have to. But if you do, we thank you. It's just like you given the New York Times some
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:05.120]   extra points, Jeff. Twit.tv/survey. Jeff, please don't take this. You'll skew the results all.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.360]   Only if all of you twig readers take it and all of you check off that you watch twig,
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.040]   all of you say that you love twig. Please, please, please, please, please.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:22.320]   Do we ask your shirt size? Dr. Momm, really? You don't have to pee in the cup. That's the
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:28.800]   optional thing. That's optional. HP. Now, see, this is not the story I want to do, but you saw
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:35.280]   Ponda own CanSecWest. This is the big security conference in Vancouver last week, shortly after
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:42.800]   the show, actually, on Thursday. They had the Ponda own contest where teams of hackers compete to see
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.560]   if they can crack modern versions of operating systems and browsers. Nobody was uncracked.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.400]   Google Chrome was cracked. Everybody was cracked. Almost all of them by a single Korean hacker
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:02.000]   named Lee who won $255,000 and a couple of laptops. And will never be unemployed.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.480]   Yeah. What job security? Steve Gibson said this guy must be really good. One of his
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:15.760]   exploits chained multiple different vulnerabilities together to slowly escalate himself. The key is
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:23.200]   to be able to run a program, arbitrarily run a program on that owned computer. And he wrote 2,000
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.400]   lines of code to hack one of them. I love Ponda own. And I just love the name.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:39.120]   The good news is, the thing I don't like about it is that these hackers keep their information,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   find exploits, and then keep it to themselves for as long as they can. But after the event,
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.680]   they do release the exploits to the companies so that they can patch them.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:57.440]   All four major web browsers were hacked. I wonder though, Jeff, if they did a Chromebook.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:04.800]   Because man, that feels like I feel like when I'm on my Chromebook, I am safe. You're in the Google
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:11.760]   I am safe. Lee's hack, the Chrome hack was the one that took 2,000 lines of code. He took down both
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.600]   stable and beta versions of Chrome by exploiting a buffer overflow race condition in the browser,
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.960]   then used an info leak at race condition into Windows kernel drivers to secure system access.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:32.160]   The standalone Chromebook fetched $75,000, the privilege escalation bug $25,000. And to finish
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.960]   it off, Google's project zero, as it usually does when Chrome is hacked at the event, said,
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:44.400]   here's an extra $10,000 for your efforts. Lee went home with $255,000. He did say the Chrome
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:50.480]   exploit was the toughest. And not only was it his first time writing native client comb,
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.080]   his first time dealing with a kernel exploit. And also he did it by himself and was competing
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.560]   on his team. Not a team. Isn't that nice? Yeah. Oh, so credit to
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:11.120]   I want to get his his full name, Jung Hun Lee, a Korean researcher. His name was Loki Hart.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.520]   Vikings reference from the history channel series, the Vikings could be could be
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:28.080]   Thor had a hammer with a Loki hat Loki has a lot of mascara and a ability to build boats
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.640]   are changed log new on body detection smart log mode and Android seems to be hitting some devices.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.520]   So this is cool. I don't know if you've used this Jeff with your Nexus six in your Chromebook,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.320]   you can unlock your Chromebook just by proximity with your Nexus six. Yep, it has to have lollipop.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.840]   Now, I love it. Now they're extending that.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:53.040]   Smart lock mode is called on body detection. Use your accelerometer to figure out when
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:00.240]   your device is in your hand or pocket. If it's not, lock it. Do you have it? I just saw I have it.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.480]   If you leave your phone sitting on a table or forget it locks. Otherwise, whenever you're using
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.040]   it, it's unlocked. That's how it should happen. After you actually actively unlock it the first
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.880]   time with your code course. It's not like, Oh, you picked it up. All right.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:27.040]   So this is Android 5.01 or later. I think we're up to 502, aren't we? It's not necessarily 5.1.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:34.640]   Yeah, I'm not on 5.1 yet and I have it. So yeah, nobody very few are on 5.1.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.440]   Well, this is great. Trusted devices trusted places trusted face on body detection. Yeah.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.880]   So this is started with the Motorola X, which was cool, which was it new when you were
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.760]   tied to a trusted device via Bluetooth. It would unlock that would and then they had the skip
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.800]   that would unlock it, which was NFC. Now they've added places. So if you're at home,
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.400]   it just stays unlocked. I have that already. Face is facial scan, but I love this on body
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.880]   detection. Keep your device unlocked while it's on you. Just unlock once and your device stays
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.400]   unlocked as long as you keep holding your device. I want fingerprint, by the way, you don't need
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.440]   any of this if you don't have to type a password. If it's just fingerprint lock it all the time,
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.840]   I don't care. That's one of the great things about the iPhone. I don't care if it's locked.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:25.200]   It's so easy to unlock it. We're doing a mini change log. Android auto now available on Android
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:32.000]   5.0 plus and pioneer head head ends and units. Android device manager now lets you find your
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.920]   lost phone using your Android Wear watch. That's cool. You could be the phone from the watch.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.000]   You could always do the watch from the phone, right? Now you can go the other way around.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   Motorola adds a new gesture for the Moto X. It's an Android 5.1.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.280]   Chop twice for flashlight.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.760]   Jeff, do you have to go?
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:16.160]   Chop twice for flashlight. See, I don't like that. I don't want the flashlight to be too easy to
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:22.400]   turn on. I hate it when that happens. Remember when we had the one plus one, Jason Allen,
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.440]   we just turn on your pocket. Yep, suddenly my pocket's getting really warm.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:35.200]   Like what's going on? Yeah, exactly. And now Canary is using the successor to Speedy.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:42.000]   Should be called Speedy-er, but it's called HTTP2. I thought Speedy was a better acronym.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.560]   So if you are on the Canary channel of your Chrome, and if you're not, you can easily do that going
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:54.640]   into your Chrome settings, you'll get support for the final draft of HTTP2. I don't know how many
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:00.240]   sites yet support that, but apparently Steve's talked a lot about it on security now,
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.000]   how or if you want to know how it works and so forth, but apparently makes a difference.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:16.640]   No, I don't know. I don't think we're Speedy. We're Sluggo. We're Sluggo. Sluggo
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:24.720]   Adaption. Cyanogen. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Turned out Microsoft. Remember, a few months ago on this
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.480]   show, I said I'm not crazy about how Cyanogen is going after Google. Why are they going after
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.720]   Google? Yeah, they're got a gift from Google and they raised money from Microsoft. Are they
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:40.400]   getting money from Rupert Murdoch? Well, turns out they didn't get money from Microsoft. That
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:48.400]   was a mistake, but they did in their series, C-Round get 80 million dollars from Twitter Ventures,
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.840]   Qualcomm, of course these Qualcomm chips are work with, telephonica, smart friend, those are both
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.540]   international telecom companies and Rupert Murdoch.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.480]   Rupert Murdoch.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.480]   C-previous discussion. Values them at half a billion dollars. It is, of course, a version of
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:09.440]   Android. Stripped of Google services. I don't know if that's really accurate. Without Google
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.200]   services, I don't think you'd really want to use any version of Android and Cyanogen,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.440]   at least on the OnePlus One has Google services. Well, when you, okay, now actually, if they think
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:23.360]   about it, when you download the ROM, if you've put a custom recovery on your Android device
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.800]   and you download the ROM, the ROM, Cyanogen does not include Google services, but there's always a
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.080]   checkbox. It says, oh, by the way, you're going to probably want Google services.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.840]   Rupert Murdoch. Yeah, you have to install at least the last time I had to do it. Yeah, it was
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.920]   separately. The Google Apps kind of package services, all separately.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:48.560]   Yeah. G apps. The G other gaps. That's why if you've ever wondered why, because it's an open source
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:56.400]   AOSP version of, but nobody wants it. Ten cent holdings is another investor.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.640]   That's Chinese. That's Chinese. Yeah.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:04.160]   Well, get Google. Go get them. Now, I think you're right, Jeff Jarvis. Maybe that's what they're
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:09.760]   up to. Yeah, Cyanogen is becoming the anti-Google, but which, you know, fine, fine. Competition is
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.040]   good. I wouldn't mind it a whole other operating system, but the funny thing is they're building
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.960]   the anti-Google on top of Google. Yeah. It just seems, it just seems weird. It's weird. Worked for Amazon.
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:26.640]   Yeah. Yeah, I didn't. Amazon unlocked. We'll give away paid apps for free. Well, they're already
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.720]   giving away paid apps, but this is more than one of the subscription service. Oh, something similar to
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.920]   like Amazon Prime or something like that, where you have a Kindle service.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:42.720]   Like all you can eat, you know? The Amazon's delivery drones, the one they famously showed
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:50.800]   on 60 minutes, they just got FAA approval to test them. Except the drone that they got approval to
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:58.560]   test has been retired. And Amazon, once you wanted the FAA to move fast, it's what they said. They
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.680]   did one of their top executives told a congressional committee yesterday that it's like, yeah, you
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.920]   guys move way too slow. We already like we're done with that drone. Now we have a new drone,
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.760]   which is not approved. And we wish you guys would approve these things faster. So the FAA did
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.120]   actually come out with a new ruling so that under 200 feet during daylight hours within visual range,
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.600]   you can now, if you have an exception pre-standing, you can just go and test it. But Amazon's saying
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.240]   that's not good enough. We're going to test in the UK because our whole point is we need to be able
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.440]   to fly drones. I could see where it's going. I could just bring you this thing. Exactly. The
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:40.400]   whole point of what we're testing is all of our algorithms and software that need to fly without
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.480]   line of sight. So anyway, so the FAA is still a dinosaur of a, and they're still holding back
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.320]   US on a day. You come down on that. Do you want the sky filled with Google drones? Yes.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:55.840]   The US has a very large sky. What Amazon is proposing is to tell you know, they don't want
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:01.760]   to crash their expensive test drones either. And what they're proposing is to test drones on a
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.000]   giant piece of private property in a remote wilds of Washington state. I don't care if they test
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.880]   them, but when they roll them out, are they going to be on giant swaths of property on Washington
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.880]   state? Or are they going to be downtown Petaluma? Well, first of all, I don't think that they're
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.720]   going to be a mainstream way to deliver things. But I do think that they'll be useful for delivering
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.520]   emergency supplies. In other words, they will save lives. I love that. Right. I just think
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.680]   they have drones have been used that way. I think if a problem emerges, we should deal with that
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:35.600]   problem. But so far, we ban the commercial use of drones and we allow the private use. And it's
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.920]   the private use. It's the private citizens who are crashing drones into the White House and all
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.440]   this mayhem. And so we're ignoring the actual part of the problem while banning something that has
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.400]   never happened as a problem. It just seems irrational to me. And you know, if it becomes a problem,
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.880]   we can just shoot them out of the sky. Shoot them out of the sky. Get a free drone.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.200]   By the way, people are perfecting new forms of drone, destructing like a beanbags that you can
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.920]   shoot. So it doesn't hurt the drone. It just takes it down. Then you got a new drone and whatever
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:14.160]   they were delivering, maybe a net like a Spider-Man net. NFL will be broadcasting one game this season
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:21.040]   on the internet instead of on DirecTV and everywhere else. It is the game. The only reason they're
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:28.080]   doing this is because it's a game that takes place at 6 AM West Coast time, 9 AM East Coast time.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.960]   It's the Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo's Bills game in week seven that is in London.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:40.800]   9 30 in the morning in the East Coast, which is of course where the bills in the Jaguars play. But
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:47.520]   yeah, I'm not, you know, not exactly the Super Bowl. Yeah, and I feel like it's not,
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   I'm not sure what they're doing here with this. It's a publicity stunt. It's a publicity stunt.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.600]   Nobody's going to watch this game anyway, so they might as well. This is one they can throw away.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:10.000]   Oh, this really pieved me a bit. Radio Shack has gone belly up. They're selling off the assets.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.520]   The stores are going to sprint and some are going to go to Amazon. But you know, and this is what
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.840]   people always talk about when they talk about privacy policies. Yeah, sure, you can trust
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.400]   company A, the current company. But what if something goes wrong and they sell their assets?
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:33.200]   Radio Shack wants to sell tens of millions of email and home addresses. These are the ones they
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:38.960]   gathered when you joined the battery club or they always ask for your phone number. Remember that
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:45.360]   at Radio Shack? Well, you thought maybe you could trust Radio Shack. Well, 13 million email
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:50.240]   addresses, 65 million customer names and physical addresses. And by the way, the company that irritated
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.280]   me every damn time asking me for my phone number when I wanted to buy a battery. Right, and given
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.360]   me hell when I didn't. Well, it turns out that was an asset. Yep. AT&T is trying to stop the data
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.560]   sale in Texas. It's a violation of state law to sell identifying information. If the company's
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.800]   privacy statement says it won't do it. So the attorney general's of attorneys general for Texas
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:18.320]   and Tennessee plan to challenge the repurchase. Part of the legal rationale behind this,
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:23.120]   because I've been through this with companies with with takeovers and stuff. Let's say that,
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.600]   oh, I don't know, Amazon about Radio Shack, then the privacy policy is written such that you could
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.320]   pass over the data to a third party such as an acquirer. In this case, it's an acquirer, right?
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:40.400]   It's out of bankruptcy. And but it's not clearly what was intended by a decent privacy policy.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.640]   I also love the fact that AT&T is trying to stop the Radio Shack sale.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:49.840]   That's ours. That's not yours. That's it's no. Yeah, I should make it clear.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:53.200]   They're not doing it to defend you. Exactly. They're just afraid that sprint will get the
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:00.000]   information. They don't want anybody else to get it. That's our data. And I think this is actually a
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:08.320]   good, might be a good tip. Thanks to is it Gary judge? Oh, yeah, that one. Yes. Yes.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.760]   His headspace a blog. He showed Jeff how to put Skype on his Chromebook.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:20.240]   It's no easy. Even I could do it. Yeah. And I think that the trick is that it's possible,
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.440]   you know, it's not that Skype suddenly runs in the browser. We're not using crouton and installing
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:32.480]   Skype on Linux, but it's impossible using an extension called twerk to run Android apps.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.760]   Twerk's an Android emulator. I'm going to put it on my Chromebook.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.040]   I haven't tried it yet. I was going to actually call you with it today.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.720]   Well, let me do it. So this is crazy because you first have to install Evernote. I don't know
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:51.200]   why it's really easy. It's easy. Twerk is dependent upon the app runtime for Chrome that Evernote installs.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:57.040]   Then you install twerk. Then you get the Skype APK because you're going to sideload this,
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.640]   drag the APK. I don't I guess you could get that from the Skype side. I don't know where you go.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.280]   The link's right there. You included the link. Yeah. Okay. But let me just see where that link
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.560]   comes from. It comes from his website. So just a word of warning when you get APKs from a third
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.120]   party site, you don't know what the hell you're getting. I'm not saying this, you know,
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:19.360]   that this guy is not completely on the up and up, but that's kind of the issue. Remember that check
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:25.440]   box you check that says, yeah, do not. I want to download apps from third parties.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.920]   Let's face with the worst case scenario. So you'll get Skype.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:34.160]   That's a good point. That's a good point. Twerk though is available in the Chrome store. So
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.600]   that's presumably okay. You'll install the APK into twerk. You'll do some settings.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:46.960]   You save it as an unpacked extension, which you then install as an extension into Chrome.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.520]   Jeez, Jeff. Never time you open it. You have to go over to your favorite.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.000]   Yeah, just keep using the back.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.600]   When I'm out of town now, when I'm out of town now, we can try this.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.840]   I bet you there are a lot of people who would really like to play Clash of Clans or whatever
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:11.360]   on their pixel. So you take this, slows it down. No, it's going through an emulator. No, no.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:18.000]   It's a Chrome, your Chromebook especially the pixel is so much faster than anything. You're fine.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.880]   In fact, it probably run better. Well, the good news is you can do this. The nice thing about a
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.160]   Chromebook is you could power wash it after you do it if you feel at all uncomfortable.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:36.160]   Yeah. But that's just a word of warning, sideloading APK is a little tricky.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.760]   All right, let me give you a final word from our sponsor and then we'll get our tip tool
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:46.240]   and number and we'll let you all hit the road. I've used Bluestacks, which is an emulator and
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:51.760]   I didn't find it was very good. So I don't know if this is better or not. Our show today brought
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.720]   to you by, but I'll tell you because I'm going to do it when I get home tonight.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:02.240]   Brought to you by HipChat. We use HipChat now. We started using it with our developers in Austin,
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.480]   Texas, the web developers. It was a great way to stay in touch with them if they have a question,
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.040]   if there's something stopping them. I'm always on HipChat because it runs on everything Android,
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:18.720]   iOS, Windows, Macintosh, everywhere. In fact, if you run it on a pixel, for instance,
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.480]   or running on a Chromebook, they have a web interface that works beautifully.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.680]   So suddenly now you're communicating. Now you may say, "Well, this looks like an instant messenger."
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:35.760]   No, no, no. It's so much more. It integrates 57 services like Jira and GitHub and Zendesk,
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:43.200]   MailChimp, Heroku, which is great for developers, but it's also great for people who wouldn't
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:50.000]   need product management services. Email is asynchronous and slow. If a team's working over email,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.280]   I think that's not ideal. Instant messenger alone is just not designed for this.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:01.040]   You're getting video chat, you're getting document sharing, screen sharing, code sharing.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:09.040]   This is great. The web developers in Four Kitchens are there in Agile House.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.880]   The whole, we have meetings every day. They really want to be able to iterate very rapidly.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.960]   So being in constant communication is great. We're using HipChat now with our engineering team,
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.560]   our sales team. And on tech news today, I see you have one for every show.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.160]   Every show because we have a different co-anchor every single day.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.400]   Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. So we have a Monday, one, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.520]   that we have one for TM2. We have one for the department in general.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.040]   There is a way to share HipChat chat with somebody outside your organization and restrict what
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:45.360]   they can see. It's really great. It's SSL. It's completely locked down, completely secure.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.040]   And if you want to even trust no one encryption, you can actually run the HipChat server
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.400]   in your enterprise. So now you really, I just think this is so great.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.800]   Just fabulous. Now there is a freemium version you can use forever.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.160]   But for the next 30 days, I want to get you the full version of HipChat. That includes all the
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:07.120]   videos sharing the screen sharing. So that's free. You don't need to give us a credit card.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:14.320]   Just go to hipchat, hipchat.com/twig. Sign up, click Start Chatting, invite some team members,
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.160]   and you're in. You've got 30 days to enjoy it. And I'll tell you a little secret. If you're one of
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.840]   the first 100 people to respond to this particular ad, right now, you got to, I don't know how long
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.800]   it takes to get those first 100 signups, but I would do it right now. You'll get 90 days, three
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:39.600]   months free. Run, don't walk to hipchat.com/twig. 90 days free for the first 100. It's really good.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:53.840]   It's really, really useful. I don't have a tool, actually I do have a few tools because now I'm a
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:45:00.080]   big Chromebook user, Jeff. I'll go for that. I'm loving. Give me some Chromebook loving.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.960]   Well, a lot of the stuff that I do on Chromebook is probably not something you would necessarily
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:12.080]   need. Although you're a writer. So one of the things that's really great about the Chromebook is
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:18.560]   it's basically Chrome. So when you install an extension on the Chromebook, it installs it globally
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:28.560]   on Chrome, which is really handy. And Chrome has its little app. I don't know, Leo. I don't know.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:32.640]   Google should be a search company. You're starting to win me over. No, hey, you shouldn't have this
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:37.680]   computer. I don't know. You're right. It shouldn't. But since it does, I'm going to use it.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:45.840]   I wish somebody else were doing this. Where's my app tour? I don't see it. Am I running some
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.480]   weird, what machine are you on? I'm on the Macintosh. Where's my? It's it's it's it's
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.560]   a no. What's weird? Where'd it go? Where'd the upper left usually? Yeah, usually is.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.960]   I want to show you this. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There's
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.760]   apps left up top left. I'm pointing to the screen. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's on the bookmark bar. Thank you.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:09.760]   There it is. So this on a Chromebook shows up as a like your star menu, which is really nice.
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.280]   And you can see I'm starting to load it up. I've used C-I-R-C for our chat room. I use secure
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:22.240]   shell to log into my my Linux server and use Emacs because I'm just that kind of guy. I use
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:28.160]   Authy for the authentication. Authy's great because it sinks across all of your devices. You should use
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:35.760]   floating Twitch. It's one of my favorite floating Twitch. It gives you a Twitch window of live.tuit.tv.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.440]   You can expand it to any size. Wow, whatever. Now this is a programmer's tool that a lot of,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.360]   well, we're going to go, hey, come back here. A lot of programmers will like. It's called
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.240]   Kerat. It's free. Some viewers send it to me. But I think Jeff, even you might use it. It's kind of
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:55.440]   the ultimate text editor. The reason programmers like it because it does syntax, it's based on the
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.360]   sublime text editor. So if you've used sublime as a programmer, you'll know it immediately.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:04.240]   It gives you access to the file structure on the Chromebook. So suddenly you're kind of using
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:13.680]   the Chromebook like a real computer. So I've been very happy with this. And as always, when you
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:19.120]   install something on your Chromebook, it appears in Chrome everywhere, which I really like.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.320]   I now have a set of tools on all the computers I use if I can only find the bar.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:30.560]   And that's just really handy. So this is somebody sent me a note because I talked about one of the
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:38.240]   few things I can't really do very well on the pixel, which is computer programming. And Kerat is
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:46.320]   very cool. There's also a site, and I'll add this to as a bonus called code anywhere. It's kind of
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.200]   the same idea. It's designed for people who are on a Chromebook. Actually, let me go to the front
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:58.480]   page, just the login page code anywhere is a cloud based programming environment. So it allows
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.120]   you to do collaboration and it'll work just great in any HTML5 browser. And of course, that means
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:09.440]   a chronic Chromebook. You have cloud storage of your software. You can work with others,
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.120]   which is great for team programming or pair programming. And they have dev box stacks,
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.360]   which is nice. So you could pick the language you want. And it's suddenly on a Chromebook,
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.040]   you're actually, it looks like you're really programming. Very affordable. I thought this was
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.160]   very cool. And there is a free trial. Most of you probably want to spend seven bucks a month if
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:35.760]   you're going to use this. So Kerat's free and it's local. But if you want to do cloud programming on
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:44.080]   Python, Angular, Node, Ruby, that kind of thing, sports, GitHub, code anywhere.com.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.800]   What do you what do you lose with that? What what? Oh, a lot.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:55.440]   Chief Lee, what you lose is REPL, which is I something I like. It's a great way to learn
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:03.040]   professionals don't care. But the idea that you can do a what does REPL stand for?
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:11.040]   I can't remember. Parson, parse and list are the last to a print list.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.720]   Anyway, it allows you to it's an interpreter. So you can you can work in the language, whether
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.080]   it's Python or Ruby or a list, you can work in the language in interactive box. And that's
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:26.080]   something you can do on desktop. You can't really do it on Pixel. You can do it remotely. I actually
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:31.280]   can. It's one of the reasons I've been using emacs on SSH is because I can there's a racket
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.080]   REPL and emacs. That's enough of that. Jeff, your number.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.120]   Well, first, I want to give a shout out. So because somebody shouted be out this
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.960]   street, I was walking down the street. Hey, Jeff Jarvis, Pete LaSanti. Hey, hey, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.760]   And it's just it's my favorite. Jesus, it was on the rotten day and it makes it a great day.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:57.840]   And so thank you, Pete. You know, thank you, twig fans. I was in Atlanta at the Atlanta
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.000]   airport after I see somebody somebody says, Oh, just I just see Jeff Jarvis, the airport,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.200]   come up and say, Oh, I love it. Two seconds. It's great. I think it's the greatest thing on earth.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.800]   Thank you. There's no one has ever asked for an autograph. They must ask you.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:18.160]   No, occasionally. Yeah. And so of course now it's not autograph autographs are dead, right?
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:24.160]   Pictures. Everybody wants to selfie. Do you get that? Oh, yeah. Now I bet you do. But you do. Not a lot.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:30.240]   I get as much as you do. No, no, I don't get it at all. That's fine. They don't want to selfie.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.600]   Would somebody on the street? No, it'd be embarrassing. Repo stands for read, evaluate,
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:46.240]   read a valve print loop. Thank you. Oh, I guess I go with this one. MIT Data Stores
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.760]   researcher wins the Allen Turin Award, which is $1 million from Google. My wife's don't break her.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:51:00.000]   So Google Google funded the Turin Award as a kind of no bell or Pulitzer of technology.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.520]   And you remember that Yuri Milner also has an award for
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:10.000]   physicists and theoretical scientists. And so is efforts to work because some of these people,
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.320]   you know, you look at the the Timbarger's leaves of the world who changed the entire world and
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.120]   didn't get rich from it per se. I mean, I hope he's good gig since, including MIT.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:26.160]   So Stormbreaker did foundational research and database management systems. An industry now worth
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:32.960]   billions. And so here's a here's a million dollar that is a shackle for you. And I think it's I think
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:38.720]   it's very cool that Google does that. He was at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:47.280]   And he founded multiple successful database companies. Wow, millions smackers. Yeah, used to
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:52.320]   be in telling Google do together was a $250,000 prize. But then Google took it over and made it
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:58.400]   around. They rounded up. He founded nine separate companies.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:05.680]   Nine. That's a busy boy. Volt DB Tammer paradigm for Vertica.
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:11.120]   Or the big names. Nice million dollars, your number of the week.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:18.400]   That's that's one. Pretty good. Now, did you have anything, Mr. Mike Elgin? You'd like to pass
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:25.280]   along to our fine twig? I do. Today at during the F8 conference, you and I were lamenting the fact
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.240]   that Facebook has a tendency to come along with a copycat, something or other. Right. Long after
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:33.840]   it's been discredited or long after it's been a long time. Can't even remember the name of most
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.760]   of them. Yeah, exactly. Well, yesterday they announced a new feature called On This Day. And
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.240]   the way that works is if you can, if you have it already and they're rolling it out over the next
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:50.240]   week. But if you have it, it's at facebook.com/OnThisDay. And what it does is it shows you things that
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:56.800]   either you posted on this day in a previous year or that when it's time to be tech. Exactly.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:06.000]   And so on this day is for Facebook only. So my pick of the week is to remember Time Hop.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.240]   I love Time Hop. Time Hop pulls from not just Facebook, but also Twitter, Instagram,
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:15.040]   Four Square, Flickr, Dropbox, Google, iPhoto and even your camera roll. And it will show you
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:21.120]   things that were posted on this anniversary in from previous years. It's a lot of fun.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:27.440]   And it's everything that On This Day is and much, much more because it pulls from so many different
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:33.360]   things. This was originally a Four Square app from a Four Square contest.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.400]   Let me know that. Yeah, I was called, I think the original name was something like
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.600]   Four Square and Seven Days ago or something like that. That was the name of the app.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:45.440]   But but nowadays Time Hop is available for both Android and iOS. You just download it. You're
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.720]   connected to your different social networks. And it will just remind you of how quickly life is
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.400]   passed new by. I mean, it'll show you stuff that happened a year ago or two years ago and you're
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:59.520]   like, really, really, it seemed like it was two months ago. Anyway, it's a lot of fun. It's very
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:07.360]   enjoyable to use. And you know, forget about that Facebook copy on This Day and just use Time Hop.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:12.080]   Yeah, I agree. It's great for Throwback Thursday. Yes. Because you've always got some images you
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:19.760]   can throw. And if you're like me and you go to Facebook.com/OnThisDay, it says, "Leo, thank you
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.480]   for coming to check out your memories. Currently, this feature isn't available." You have no memories.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:29.600]   No memories. Because you've canceled your Facebook account for 10 times. I've been in the castle
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.480]   at now. Let me tell you. Thank you, Mike. Yeah, again, it's always great to have you. He's our
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.040]   news director. Guy in charge of our news coverage. That's such a great job every Monday through Friday.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:45.600]   10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern Time, 1700 UTC on Tech News today. That's right. And you can also
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.040]   catch them tomorrow a little earlier at 9 a.m. Right? You're going to start now. That's right now,
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.440]   really again. Yes. And of course, you can always subscribe to Tech News today on the app. The
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.520]   podcast app of your choice. So. Yeah. And then following it tomorrow, we're going to do F8.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:00.400]   That's right. For sure. Reality tomorrow. Tomorrow's going to be the fun one, I think.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:04.880]   That's what that's what we're hoping. Couldn't be less fun. Did anything today make you say, "Ooh?"
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:14.320]   Made me say, "Ew." Oh, does that count? Well played. Well played, my friend. Yeah, I can't think of a
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:21.040]   one thing that Facebook announced yesterday that made me go like, "I want that." And I tried. Because,
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000]   in fact, I even apologize during our special, and that's a Twit Live special if you want to watch it.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.080]   I didn't mean to be snarky and negative, but I couldn't find anything to say, "Oh, that's great.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:36.800]   I can't wait to get that." Everything was been there done at the spherical video, all of it.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:43.040]   Yeah. They don't. Yeah. Yeah. They don't seem to be good at inventing new things. And yet they did,
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:48.320]   and they are, and they're smart, and Apple's done fine not inventing new things, just refining
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:55.520]   existing things. But Facebook, everybody just goes, "That's nice. Show me pictures of my cat."
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:02.560]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York. CUNY, they call it. He's also on Google+,
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.320]   as is Mike. Both of these guys are big Google+ers. Are you at all in any way feeling like I should
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:15.440]   put less on Google+. It's a public page. If you post a public, it's like having your own website,
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:18.320]   even if you don't have engagement. If you do have engagement, it's all that's good. It's just like Google's
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.600]   really into it anymore. It's really frustrating. This whole mirror-cat thing,
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.640]   which I know you're fed up with. Why didn't they do this three and a half years ago and just make
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:29.600]   hangouts on air, something you could do from a mobile device? They were so close, weren't they?
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:36.480]   But it is frustrating, and I wish they would do a lot more. But it's still a bazillion-bradley.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.840]   Bradley's in charge. Now, let's see what he does. Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.840]   Love Bradley. Yep. He's cool. Love Bradley.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:47.920]   Jeff also has authored many great books. He blogs at Buzzmachine.com. Get that geek-sparing gift.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.000]   That's about the news industry. It's wonky. It's for newswalks.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.560]   It's if we can reinvent news in the internet world. But I think a lot of what you talk about
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:07.280]   is happening, which is good. And we do this show every... It's kind of my last show of the week,
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.240]   so I'm always a little glazed by this time of the day. Every Wednesday, 1PM Pacific, 4PM
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:18.720]   Eastern Time 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv. If you want to watch live, we love that. You can be in our
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:26.000]   Jettroom IRC.twit.tv. But you can also get on-demand audio and video at twit.tv/twig or iTunes or
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.840]   any of your podcatchers overcast or pocketcast or dogcatcher, whatever it is that you like to use.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.000]   We also have great apps thanks to our independent third-party developers. We don't do any
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.120]   ourselves, but they've done a great job. And you should find those apps on iOS, Android, Windows,
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:46.960]   Phone, Roku. Somebody received a number of emails that we are no longer listed on Tivo. Tivo,
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:53.840]   which is a relatively small platform, has its own podcast section. And I guess not never were
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.960]   all our shows listed there, but a few were. And apparently, Tivo has pulled them down. You can
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:04.480]   manually enter RSS into that, although I don't know who would want to do that. And I apologize to
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.960]   those of you who watch us on Tivo. I have no idea. We never... Tivo never asked us ahead of time. They
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.120]   never told us they were pulling us down. We didn't even... We don't even really know anybody at Tivo.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:20.880]   Tom Rogers. Well, Patrick Delahandy in our programming department, in our engineering department,
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.920]   says he is in touch with Tivo about getting it back. It's a weird thing. I don't know what
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.280]   happens. If you have problems, let me know. You know somebody over there? I know the CEO.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.840]   Do you think they would help? You tried first, and if you have a problem,
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:38.720]   I complain on Twitter once about a broken Tivo box in Bingo. Tom was there fixing it.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:46.080]   He came to your house? Well, yeah. With a screwdriver. Yeah. A butt crack. That's a service. I am a Tivo
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:54.960]   Romeo Pro user. I love my Tivo. I've sold the world on Tivo's, so I'm somewhat mortified that
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:00.160]   Tivo doesn't like me back. All right, well, we'll keep that in mind. And if Patrick doesn't have
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.920]   any success, we'll let you know. Let me know. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time.
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:13.920]   On Twitter.
