[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   verse the Twitter the Facebook and all that jazz Gina trip Annie as you know has the month
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   of December off as she relocates to the East Coast.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.040]   I guess she's going on a conistoga wagon.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   I don't know why it takes four weeks, but that's the way it is.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   We miss her.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.240]   We will have her back January.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.560]   But meanwhile still got Jeff Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.000]   You can't get rid of me like a bad cold better not get rid of you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.720]   You can around I know Jeff.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   In fact, I welcome this opportunity to spend a little time with Jeff because he's one of
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.040]   the smartest guys I know and and Gina just slows us down with like facts.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   So Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism city university of New York.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   He's the author of public parts a great book about living in public and privacy.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.120]   Also many other things, including Gutenberg the geek the single from Amazon, which is
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   now an audio book read by Jeffrey.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.840]   And many people don't know, but you for many years were a television critic.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.360]   Indeed, I was TV critic and people, a TV guy than people.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.680]   And you worked for the examiner, right?
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   Yes.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   San Francisco.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   I had a column way back in the day called take five.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.640]   That's what I read religiously.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.240]   And I was I've been a Jeff Jarvis fan since then since take five.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.600]   You're always too kind.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   No, I loved it.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.160]   Exameter now is I don't know what it's like a free the free weekly or something.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.520]   It's not what his paper isn't a poor, thin, miserable shell of itself.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.760]   But the Hearst Corporation, which ran it was really great.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.240]   We had it was like many towns, a two paper town.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.360]   They had a morning paper in your afternoon paper.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.160]   The Hearst Corporation ran the examiner.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760]   It was William Randolph Hearst's first newspaper, I think, or one of his first.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.320]   And then the the young family ran the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.560]   And then what happened was, you know, like most cities, you couldn't support two newspapers.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120]   So the Hearst bought the Chronicle, the young family retired.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.320]   And and they said, well, we can't we'll just give up the examiner and we'll run the
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   Chronicle.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.520]   So in a way, the examiner continues name just changes name.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.920]   Yeah, that's all think of it that way.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.080]   Freebie.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.960]   So Jeff, lots of stories, but one that we do that is really applicable to the to media
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.320]   coverage and and frankly, makes me every time these things happen, wipe my brow there, but
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.280]   for the grace of God, a Google shuttle in San Francisco, blocked by protests.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   There's a lot of pastors, mostly because San Francisco's gotten very expensive and there
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.200]   are a lot of people who feel that it's the fault of all these dot com millionaires, Google
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   and Apple and everybody else living there.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.000]   And these companies, all the big companies, Yahoo Google and Apple have their special buses.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.400]   And these buses use public bus stops.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.760]   So protesters blocked this private shuttle saying it's not right.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.160]   You shouldn't be able to use the public bus stops without paying fees.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.620]   The San Francisco displacement and neighborhood impact agency, they call themselves.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.000]   And a guy gets I guess gets off or is in any way, they're surrounded by television cameras
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.280]   and a guy claiming to be a a Google employee starts shouting at them saying, Hey, you know,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.680]   get a job.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   And all the things you'd expect an insensitive rich guy to do.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.940]   You want to show we watch the little bit of the, this is from the San Francisco Bay
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.940]   Guardian.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.940]   Here is the, you can't hear me.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.440]   I look, I've been here for six months.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.440]   Hey, look, I live around the corner.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   I don't need anything.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.280]   I'm looking, I can pay my rent.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   Can you pay your rent?
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   Can you pay your rent?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Well, then you know what?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.000]   Why don't you go to a city where you can't afford it?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   Why don't you go to a city where you can afford it?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.560]   Turns out it's all staged.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.320]   This guy's a labor pro to a labor leader.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.880]   The whole thing is staged.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   The whole thing is fake.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.440]   And of course, a lot of news organizations got bit by it.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.200]   And I always when I look at something like this, I go, Oh God, there, but for the grace
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.800]   of God go I, how do you avoid getting bit by something that's so blatantly a fake?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.960]   I mean, also, I think you try to cover the story the way it is.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.400]   What I tweeted about this whole incident was this is, I'm sorry, but this is the reason
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.760]   why I'm glad I am not in San Francisco anymore.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.480]   It's the obvious proto liberal and I mind you, I'm a Democrat, I'm a liberal, but I got sick
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.200]   of fellow liberals because they can really be pains in the butt.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   And what do you expect these people to do?
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Right?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   So, okay, that's fine.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.800]   Kill all the buses.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   Every employee is going to drive a Mercedes from San Francisco to Mountain View.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   Oh, that's good.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.360]   And they're all going to have to park on the street.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.320]   You're going to fight with them for parking spots.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.520]   And but that, but you know what the heck, you know what the buses, you don't like the
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   buses.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   That's fine.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.720]   Or suddenly they're all going to leave.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.440]   Google's going to pick up and go to another city and you're going to watch the real estate
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   places drop.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.000]   Okay, maybe that's what you want, but that's not good for the economy.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   They're going to take the jobs away with them.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   You want that?
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   What is it you really want?
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   Why is he just complaining?
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   Somebody's making money.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   Now, there are issues to the new tech 1% that I think we have to deal with.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.240]   There is a new creation of wealth in the tech industry that they've got to deal with
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.240]   responsibly.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.480]   But in this case, it's your neighbors who have a job somewhere else.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.520]   They'd rather live in San Francisco than Mountain View.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.200]   And they are using a form of public transportation to get there and not clogging up the streets
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.360]   and not clogging up the roadways on the way to the peninsula.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.160]   And I don't say anything wrong with that.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.680]   And so it's just one of these stupid things that tries to make nothing into a cause and
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   that piss me off.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.760]   So from that level right there, you say, we TV news cameras are getting gamed at that
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   level.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.520]   If you even go out and cover this crap.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.680]   And then you play along with the next level of being gamed, which is this guy making the
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   stuff up.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   Beware.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.800]   Within an hour of the original post, the Guardian learned that the guy was not an actual
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.480]   Google employee, even though they ran the story at first as if he was.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   But Max Bell Alper is a union organizer with Unite here, local 2850.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.840]   They asked him, why did you do that?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.680]   And he said, this is a political theater.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.920]   He's going to demonstrate what's happening in the city.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's more than just the bus.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.760]   These are enormous corporations that are investing in this community.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.280]   These companies like Google should be proud of where they're from and invest in their
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.280]   communities.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   I'm confused.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.640]   I think what they're saying, you don't invest in Mountain View, invest in San Francisco.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.800]   I guess Google has an office in San Francisco.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.360]   Pay for the bus shelters.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.680]   Ah, well, they do because the taxes that they pay taxes.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.320]   All of yeah, just as much as Max Alper paid for the best shelter.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   He didn't pay for the city of San Francisco money to use the best shelter.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.760]   When asked if he intentionally intended to deceive media, he said, people are talking
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.600]   all over the country about what's happening in San Francisco.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.840]   That's the debate we need to have here.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.320]   The more we talk about it, the more we think about it, the more we're going to see tech
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.640]   companies need to contribute.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.520]   He didn't respond.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.840]   In other words, whether intentionally deceived the media, he did say he didn't intend to
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.440]   engage in theater before going to the protest.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.000]   But when he was there, he made the decision spontaneously to stage the argument.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.560]   I got to point out the protesters were wearing, as you saw in that video, were wearing, you
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.080]   know, reflective vests.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   He wouldn't.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.920]   I don't think it was that spontaneous.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.640]   He did not when asked repeatedly by media who he was, and then they asked to talk him
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   he did not.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   I mean, it was pretty obvious.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   It's a lie.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   It's a lie.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   It's a lie.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   Plain out and simple.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   But it plays to the weakness of TV news.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.760]   You know, I want to start writing about that topic.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.040]   And I was going to talk to you, Leo, about this is we need to reinvent television news.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.240]   We're assuming that it has to operate in its old stupid orthodoxies.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   And we know what they are.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.640]   We know what all they are covering fires, being taken in by PR events like this.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.840]   What's wrong with TV news and how do we reinvent it?
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.800]   And if I look at new models, when I speak to a company, I've spoken to video, you know,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.040]   TV news companies around the world, they come in and say, oh, what's hot in New York?
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.520]   And I always bring you up, Leo.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.680]   I always, always show them twig.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   And I and I, and I, and I show them the, you know, this magnificent absurdity you've
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   created.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   It is absurd.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   I'll give you that.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   It is.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.320]   But a hundred or two hundred and fifty thousand people will sit here for an hour and a half.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.400]   You know, I just loved it on, on, on the, on the chat room beforehand.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.040]   Steve went on, Steve, Steve got blessed with him, talked security 24 hours, said, uh,
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.000]   Leo, it's already been a hundred minutes.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.080]   You know, this a little long while turning over a new leaf.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.960]   I want to be clear about this, Jeff, two hour security now's, or were the norm until recently.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.920]   So then somebody in the chat room complained and said, uh, no, no, screen now should be
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640]   two and a half to three hours.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   We should be all day.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.200]   So they'll just take as much of you as they can get versus, you know, vine.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.320]   So you gotta leave them six minutes to 600 minutes.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   Six seconds.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   And, and, and, or six seconds.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   Thank you.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.800]   And, and everything in between and TV can be rethought.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.880]   But this is just silly story is an example of TV news, assignment, desk, taking up, you
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.280]   know, whatever flakery is sent their way, sent in cameras, as if it's real news when
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.640]   it's just made up BS.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.880]   Well, and, and by the way, I think that they, uh, by doing that, do a disservice to the
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   story.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.040]   So, um, I mean, there are all sorts of things that media does wrong.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.680]   The he said, she said kind of coverage that CNN has, is espousing, but also, you know,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.200]   if it bleeds, it leads and news has always done this.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.880]   The more yelling there is, the more controversy, the more visceral and emotional.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   And everybody knows this.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.840]   That's why YouTube, I remember talking to Tim Street, who's a great video maker.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.400]   He did a lecture on how to become a viral video.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.800]   He said, the more emotions you can engage in a shorter amount of time, the more likely
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.900]   you are to get viral.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.760]   If you can bring people make people laugh and cry and be scared and jump for joy, you're
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.400]   going to be huge.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.120]   And that's, and local television news has known that for years.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.480]   But unfortunately, I think anathema to television is the idea of abstract ideas you can't illustrate
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.920]   with, with pictures.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.400]   It's so hard to do because people have to sit there and watch people like us talk and
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   think.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.480]   And I think there's legitimate, I don't know what the answer is.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.640]   I mean, the city of San Francisco is becoming gentrified.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.800]   That means, uh, it's been gentrified for years and years and years and years.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   But I was there.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   You couldn't, I couldn't afford an apartment.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.680]   There are people in the mission district, which is a beautiful district, uh, where a
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.400]   lot of low income people live.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   And they're being evicted and forced out now because it's also happens to be a very popular
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   place for, uh, the yuppies.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.400]   Do we still call them yuppies for the yuppies to move in?
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.440]   They're called the Googlers now.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.840]   They're Googlers.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.200]   Dinks, dueling, no kids.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   The same point, right?
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.600]   The center of San Francisco, the center of, you know, the center of the universe, uh,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.680]   you go through the tenderloin and it's still the tenderloin.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.000]   Hey, you could still shoot up in the, the tenderloin on the street and nobody will bug
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   you.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.280]   So there are places to stay.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.560]   I, I feel, I do feel a little bit bad for, uh, for people who have been living in San
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   Francisco.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.400]   And one of the, one of the points these guys make is that San Francisco has been, uh, always
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.480]   been a very diverse and interesting culturally.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.920]   And now it's getting more uniform.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.280]   It's just a bunch of, uh, of nerds, um, guys invest guys have hipsters.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.000]   Wow.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   That's okay.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.440]   Eat your heart out, Chipotle.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.960]   Uh, Lisa, Lisa just brought me lunch.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.640]   Is that what the hell is that?
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.040]   Is that a macho burrito?
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.920]   That's the medium Jesus, it's got an overhead shot of that.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.200]   Uh, well, you know, what's nice is it kind of looks like the, uh, Mexican flag.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.800]   Remember, where's the, where's the microphone?
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.600]   Where's the camera?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.000]   It could be, it could be the, uh, the Mexican flag.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.720]   I'm going to eat the Mexican flag and this, my friends is why you can't get an apartment
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   in San Francisco.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.640]   You can't fit.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.880]   Actually, the same things happened in a Petaluma.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.440]   The San Francisco, the, uh, Petaluma hotel, which is across the street here was a residence
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   hotel.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.560]   That means low income poor people, uh, older people were living there cheaply and somebody
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.720]   bought it and it's turning into an actual hotel and kicking them out.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.080]   So I mean, I think that's terrible.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.480]   So I do think that there's an issue as societal issue.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.760]   I don't know what the answer is because we live in a free market economy.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.280]   You can't, you can only go.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.680]   Getting mad at the workers who are going to their job, you know, all mass rather than
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.040]   individual cars and bring money to your economy.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040]   That's the wrong way to go.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   They're not the enemy.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.080]   Your neighbor is not the enemy in this case.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.840]   Um, now more news from Glenn Greenwald.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.400]   As we continue to leak out more and more about the NSA, the latest is the NSA uses Google,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.560]   this comes from the Washington Post, uh, uses Google cookies to pinpoint targets for hacking.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.360]   They're secretly, uh, riding on top of cookies.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.920]   Uh, they're, they're, usually they're, they're anonymized.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.840]   They're not people, but I guess it helps them string together, uh, communications into one
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.840]   person.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   Exactly.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.880]   And then what they're going to do then with these apparently according to this slide is
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.600]   offensive hacking.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.040]   They're going to go out and spearfish them.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.760]   They're going to try to get malware on their computer where we were learning now that the
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   FBI, uh, has used malware, uh, to investigate, uh, crimes.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.560]   They literally put key loggers and stuff on your system using spearfishing attacks.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.280]   I wonder whether this has anything to do with Google, uh, trying to create new advertising
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.520]   targeting mechanisms and giving up cookies.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.880]   It's got to kill Google because of course this is the fear everybody has about all of
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   this.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   Oh, you're tracking this.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   You're tracking this.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.760]   No, we're not says Google, but the government is and, and, and using Google, I mean, using
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Google cookies.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.880]   Apparently the GCHQ and Britain and the NSA have found particular use for a part of a
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.640]   Google specific tracking mechanism known as the PrEPF cookie.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.680]   No personal information, but that, but a numeric code that is a unique identifier.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   So you got the unique identifier.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.520]   You know, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.360]   Um, and then you can continue to see that code as the person travels around, uh, knowing
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   where they go.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.960]   So, uh, according to these slides, the cookies are used to quote, enable remote exploitation.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.400]   The slides don't say exactly, uh, how this is done.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.320]   But I guess if you know where people are going, you could then hack a site, for instance,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.760]   uh, that the person, uh, frequent waiting for them.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.600]   Once it sees the cookie, it can literally just attack them.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.480]   Uh, I mean, it's not, it's not too hard to figure out this.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.800]   They could, I presume use anybody's cookie to do this.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.000]   That just Google's the most ubiquitous.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.360]   Anytime a browser makes a connection to any Google property at all, a preff cookie is
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.040]   created giving a, so that it's a unique identifier.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.400]   So I have a unique identifier.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.600]   You have a unique identifier maps Google search, of course, Google plus YouTube.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   Um, and even if there is a like button, so a lot of sites are not Google sites, but
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.440]   they have a like button or they use Google connect.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.720]   Uh, if there's a Google plus widget, uh, and even, you know, think about it.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.920]   Google ads and sense ads are everywhere.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   Right.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:01.120]   And also it says that there was a program called happy foot, which uses, um, mobile
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   IDs.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:09.120]   I love, I love that the NSA's hackers are so inventive in their naming.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.520]   That, that's how you know they're really hackers.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.440]   Code name, happy foot.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440]   True.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.840]   As far as they didn't name it, but for footstone characters.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.720]   Um, so this is even better than internet geo location services, happy foot.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.560]   Uh, even when GPS is not able to contract you down.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.560]   What are you going to do?
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.480]   So did you, did you, what did you think of the, uh, the Google letter, the Google at
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.080]   all the eight tech companies letter to the president and Congress on Monday makes for
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   a great full page ad in the New York Times.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Mm hmm.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   And which it was.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   Yes.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.360]   Um, and of course, uh, you know, there's two things going on.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.680]   One is, um, of course these companies are pissed off because it hurts their business.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.920]   So inter overseas and it makes their users suspicious of them regardless of the fact
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.160]   that some or all of these companies probably have cooperated with the feds for years.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.520]   I mean, particularly Microsoft, when I see Microsoft going, Oh, no, this is terrible.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.280]   Am I, am I the only one?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.000]   Maybe it's just, maybe it's my bias who feels like, come on, Microsoft, you've been helping
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.800]   them out for years.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.840]   Now, oh, no, no, we don't want.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.480]   Um, but on the other hand, I think that there is real economic damage that's being done to,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.920]   to the industry and these companies.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.640]   I mean, I wrote a piece for the Guardian called me, uh, was this, this come out Monday?
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.000]   Monday, December, noon, I got, I got, I got an all the rest of the community and said,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.160]   you know, I'll write a commentary was embargoed till midnight.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.760]   And, uh, so, uh, as I thought this through, yeah, my first point is this is in there
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.680]   economic, albeit, uh, enlightened self interest, right?
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.560]   And what's, what's bad for spying is bad for the internet.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.720]   Uh, what's bad for the internet is bad for Silicon Valley.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.120]   What's bad for Silicon Valley is bad for America to rewrite the old GM saw.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.800]   So there's definitely an economic factor.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   That's a good way to question about it.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.880]   But I also was delighted to see, you know, I want to see this discussion raised to the
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.480]   level of principles and the eight companies put forward proposed principles that for instance,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.360]   the government should not be hoovering everything up.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.960]   They should be doing what we, the law had expected before, which is they go after specific
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.760]   targets for specific reasons and have some specificity to what they're, they're seeking,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.600]   which nobody's going to argue with, um, that there needs to be some level of transparency.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.960]   There needs to be oversight, uh, and, and also that, that, uh, an oversight clearly has
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.240]   failed.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.480]   And finally that, um, we need to avoid the move toward a Balkanized web, which is occurring
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   here.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.320]   Sorry, it wasn't a better picture there, Chad, uh, that I took downstairs here.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.240]   Uh, but the principles also say that the, this idea for instance from Brazil, that Brazil
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.160]  ians data should be stored in Brazil, where by the way, the Brazilian government could
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.720]   get to it more easily.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.480]   We, the data shouldn't have to respect national boundaries.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.800]   Uh, so these principles are reform, government surveillance.com.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.520]   And, and I'm glad that's where they're trying to push the discussion.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.600]   I think that part is good.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.880]   And I argue that there are things that are missing here.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   Oh, sorry.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   My light thinks I'm dead.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   Now I got to stand up.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   Oh, wait.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   It's got your bank.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Cheese.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.360]   I got to get all the way over there.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.520]   So this is something the university implemented to save power.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.600]   And I noticed you also, you're also freezing your ass off.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.280]   So they must have turned off the heat safe.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.800]   It's a government employees.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.120]   Um, I'm wearing a safety vest.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   Bulletproof.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.560]   Um, so, so what's going on?
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560]   What's missing from this?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.200]   Well, what's missing is a letter to David Cameron on the GCHQ.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.000]   This is an American companies thinking this is an American problem, which to some extent
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.800]   it is, but it's a worldwide problem.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.880]   What's also missing are various other companies and parts and industries.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.720]   Where's Amazon?
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.800]   Amazon runs a lot of the cloud.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.960]   Amazon, uh, also has big contracts for the CIA as Jeff Bezos mentioned on, um, uh, 60
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.320]   minutes last week.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.520]   Uh, so where's it?
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   Amazon.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.120]   It's a company like Salesforce that depend upon the cloud and itself where certainly
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.840]   are the telcos, where are is Verizon and where's AT&T and where is level three, uh, which
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.880]   allegedly are in a position to handle our metadata and enable taps straight into the
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   internet.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.200]   Where is Cisco and other hardware companies whose hardware is used to turn off and also
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.720]   turn off the net?
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.120]   Um, there's a lot that comes next.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.880]   And then finally I argued, where are the technologists as a tribe?
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.480]   You know, that we have the two Google engineers who when they found out about the direct taps
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.760]   and lines between Google servers, uh, issued a big FU to the NSA and that's fine, but anger
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.280]   is not a principle.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.600]   It's just a reaction after the fact.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.680]   And I keep on hoping for a larger discussion among technologists, uh, mathematicians,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.600]   programmers, developers, statisticians, to, uh, look at the limits of, of, of what, of
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   their power.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   They have great power.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.760]   They are the nuclear scientists of our age.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.040]   They have technology that can be used for good or bad.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.960]   And they as individuals, I argue, and as a, as a, as a society need to get together
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.280]   and need to discuss what their limits are and what's going too far.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.960]   And so that when a spy or government or an employer asked them to do something, uh, what,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.720]   what standards do they call upon?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.920]   The NSA once again is the largest employer or mathematicians in the United States.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.520]   Uh, what are the standards?
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.400]   So, so I finally just argued that, that, that it starts with, um, a Hippocratic oath
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.440]   for technologists, which is first harm, no user, a little obvious and a little, a little
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   oversimplified.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.560]   I will grant, but we have to have a discussion of what harms the people who make your tools
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.000]   and your platforms and the internet work.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.520]   And just because government has done it, even if it's legal, uh, that's no excuse.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.600]   And so we need a bigger discussion nonetheless with all those caveats, with the economic
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.480]   self interest, with all that, I was delighted to see the eight companies send the letter
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.800]   to the White House because they do have clout.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   And they are fight for us.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.000]   And I think that we're, we now have to have the real debate.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.160]   AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo are the, uh, eight companies
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   and look who's here.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   Matthew Ingram joining us.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   That's you.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   Go home.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.320]   Hey, Matthew, thanks for a dialing in.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   We appreciate it.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.320]   No problem.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.720]   I feel a little underdressed.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.960]   Well, Jeff's wearing a vest.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.680]   I'm wearing a, a, a, a, you guys have a unit.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.520]   Cloe in San Francisco.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   I've, I've heard of it.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   Yeah, we do.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   I think it is the greatest.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   It is the Ikea of clothes.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   Is it?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   So it's not a brand.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   It's a store.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   Chad's going.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   Yes, I know.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   It's both.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   It's both.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.120]   Um, and they have a very sort of, it's, it's very much like the Ikea of, of clothing.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   They have a very, that stylized brand.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.120]   You have to, you have to sew it yourself.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.520]   And that you get it home.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520]   Cloe.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.720]   No, um, but they have like silly things like they have like a wake up app, you know, that's
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   just an alarm clock app that's from Uniqlo.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.560]   And it's just, it's interesting to your clothes.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   You know, it's just weird.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   They're right phone.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   Are they an American company?
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   Who aren't they?
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   Japanese company.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.840]   Oh, well, this is, is a, is a, a, a, a, a, a, um, fake down vest.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   It's the lightest thing.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   It weighs nearly nothing.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.520]   I have a whole coat that is this down that weighs like two ounces.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   It's incredible.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.200]   And you can roll it up into a little ball and I can put it in my briefcase.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.760]   A winter coat.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.320]   Um, this is, is uniqlo.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.260]   The first, the first Uniqlo.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.260]   $49.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.880]   Was opened in 1984 in Hiroshima or her Shiroshima, Japan.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.640]   It was a chain of roadside stores to an international leader in style, quality and fun.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.320]   They're a leader in fun.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   Fun.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.680]   Anyway, we were talking before we started talking about clothing about this, the, uh,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:58.440]   the big eight, uh, talk, asking the president and the government to adhere to these principles.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.500]   On living, limiting governments authority to collect users information.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.580]   And they say that this is, it's time for the world's government.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.540]   So they did address this to the U S, but they say it's time for the world's governments
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.660]   to address the practices and laws regulating surveillance of individuals and access to
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.580]   their information.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.780]   So it isn't just president Obama.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:24.060]   It's everybody oversight and accountability, transparency about government demands.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:30.840]   These are the companies, by the way, uh, well, at least, uh, Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter,
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.520]   Yahoo and Microsoft who have been publishing those transparency reports, taking Google's
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   lead.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.280]   Um, but they can't say much because the government, but the Patriot Act prohibits them from saying
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.920]   anything too specific.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.080]   Res, res, respecting the free flow of information and avoiding conflicts among governments.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.040]   You know, you got to start with that.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.240]   If there's no more war, if there's no more conflicts between governments, who needs all
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.840]   this spying.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.560]   What we really need is a global world government run by corporations.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   That's what we need.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   Larry Page for emperor.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.960]   Well, that's how you become, and then you become the president of the internet.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.520]   Leo and that's the president, um, the world.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.400]   We need the league of justice.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   That's what we need.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   That's right.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   That's shield.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.960]   So you can read it all at, as Jeff said, reform government surveillance.com.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.980]   I guess you mentioned the term motherhood at all.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   No apple pie or motherhood.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.500]   I mean, you know, I'm in favor of all those things too.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.660]   And it would be great if we could make them happen, but, but how are they going to help
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.660]   that happen?
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.580]   Or is it just a statement of, wouldn't it be great if we were all free?
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.740]   I'm not so cynical about this.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.660]   I think, I think that, you know, there, there, there is now a discussion, you know, the discussion
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.740]   had to wait until I'm disappointed, remain disappointed.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.700]   I've said it on the show that Google and company, all those eight companies and more who aren't
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.220]   there didn't do this six months ago in this seven month long story.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.220]   They tried to hide.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:02.460]   I talked with executives at other companies who said, no, no, I, no, we don't want to
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.460]   get anywhere near this.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   We just don't talk about it.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   It kind of goes away.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.020]   And I said, BS, not going away.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.340]   And so when it finally affected them so directly with, with taps in, in their own lines among
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.860]   their servers, they got mad enough to do something the same as Diane Feinstein, your
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.860]   Senator Leo.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.860]   I know.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:25.180]   It was the, was the love girl of the NSA until they went after Angela Merkel.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.100]   Oh, that's what I'm on.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.420]   Um, can't do that.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.180]   Uh, and, and, and, you know, God helps their, their tapping Diane's phone.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.260]   Uh, so yeah, this took too long, but I still think it's important that it's happening.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.780]   There is now a discussion.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.300]   There is going to be review and reform in this country of some form.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.820]   So it's time that we start getting into specifics.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:52.940]   So I think proposing principles, uh, like these is a very constructive act and, and the
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:58.940]   first principle of trying to limit what you do to what's needed to do, to define a need
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.860]   rather than saying just because we can gather it all, we will gather it all.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.820]   That is the crux of the argument.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:11.180]   And certainly in the U S, I doubt the GCHQ cares one with, but certainly in the U S, these
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.540]   eight are important for camp.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.620]   I mean, this is when, when, when President Obama was running for president, he came to
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.460]   Silicon Valley and talk to these people.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.220]   These are, these are important thought leaders in the United States.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.420]   It's a very important part of the U S economy.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.860]   And I guess we could take it.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.380]   I don't want to say at face value, but I guess we could take them as being sincere and saying
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.180]   they'd like to solve this with, with, with the given of, of their economic interest.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.060]   I mean, they're, they do have something to work.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060]   Simply.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.060]   Yes, they're company.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.060]   That's all required.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   I mean, I think it's a very important part of the U S and my, my putative sometimes boss
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.660]   Alan Russperger, the editor of the Guardian was called before a parliament, a select
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.500]   committee a week ago.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:57.260]   And it was a shameful horrid performance from some of the MPs there who questioned his patriotism
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.300]   for revealing government's actions to government citizens.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:08.060]   And, and the attitude in the UK is oddly very different from what it is here.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.380]   I understand to their, hmm?
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.980]   What is the attitude there?
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:18.220]   The attitude there is a, it's said that Brits like spies over simplification, but there's
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.220]   less hostility to a spy structure.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:28.060]   You know, James Bond and all that, John LeCarré, more substantively, you also have a war going
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.340]   on among the newspapers.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.580]   And because the Guardian reported on the bad activities, the spying and the phone hacking
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.300]   of news Corp, that's leading to new talk of regulating all newspapers.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.980]   And I'm not actually in favor of that, but be that as it may.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.180]   And so all the newspapers hate the Guardian.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.900]   And so nobody's standing up with the Guardian, even as this shameful performance occurs in
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   parliament.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.060]   I don't think it's just that though.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:56.100]   I think there's a, and this is just my based on, you know, no scholarly research whatsoever,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:03.140]   but there seems to be an attitude in the UK and, and in Canada as well that freedom of
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:09.180]   information is not a sort of absolute and that when push comes to shove, it's society,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.220]   those societies are much more likely to say, well, the government would be, wouldn't be
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.340]   doing it if there wasn't something important behind it.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340]   Therefore, we should.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.340]   Right.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   You're right back here.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   There's a reflection regulation there that reflects to trust.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.940]   When I, when I talked about public parts in Germany at the Republican Conference before
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.820]   I wrote it, and I talked about what I called the German paradox of, of, of about privacy,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.020]   and the audience said, well, what about the American paradox?
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.020]   And I said, well, what's that?
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.500]   And they said, the American paradox is that you Americans have probably the best government
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.700]   of anyone in the world for the last 200 years, but you have the least, sometimes the least
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   trust in government.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.220]   You have some of the worst companies, but you trust companies more than we do in Europe.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.420]   And so in Europe, it's the opposite.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.220]   There's, there's much less trust of companies, much more trust of government.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.380]   There's a libertarian streak here, even if you're not, you're simply right.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.580]   I think that that's the difference too.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.300]   And I think you're absolutely right, Matthew, that Canada is certainly not only because
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.600]   it was part of the empire, but Robertson Davies used to say that Canada is more like
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.100]   Scandinavia than like the US.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.220]   Well, and the principle is the principles, peace, order and good government, right?
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.220]   Right.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.500]   Not life, liberty and the pursuit of, you know, a big gulp or whatever.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.700]   It's, it's, it's order and good government.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   Sorry.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.260]   I want to take a break because we have to, but I'm really glad Matthew is here.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.020]   Matthew talked a little bit, wrote about hoaxes on giga home.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.380]   We were talking before you got here about the Google, uh, protester hoax.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.420]   Uh, and, and what this means for a new media, I want to talk about that.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.900]   Um, it, according to the financial times, YouTube could be a stand to make as much as
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.700]   five point six billion dollars this year in advertising.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.140]   Whoa.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.940]   And, and the up worthy problem.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.980]   I think you'll, I think you and Matthew and Jeff will know what I mean when I say that,
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.500]   um, Facebook and up worthy.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.300]   We'll talk about, uh, lots more.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.020]   This is a good panel for this kind of thing.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:05.980]   Uh, and just a bit, as I mentioned, Gina is off this month, but contrary to rumors,
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.420]   she is not off the show.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.060]   She will be back in January.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.620]   We're doing a special show actually, um, for a Christmas day, we're going to do a best
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   of, is it too late now to contribute to the best of chat?
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.620]   Have you already edited it?
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   All right.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.620]   Nope.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.620]   Nope.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.820]   If there are memories you have of the year 2013 that you think should be an a best of,
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.740]   go to twit.tv/bestof, twit.tv/bestof.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.620]   And it says things like, what's the time code?
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.740]   Don't please don't, what's the frequency, Kenneth?
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.060]   That don't be, don't be put off by that.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   Do it.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.220]   Give us whatever you know.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.580]   If you happen to know the time code, okay, but I doubt you do.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.580]   I don't.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.020]   We're looking for stuff like conversations and big topics, not like Jeff sneezed a whole
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.020]   bunch in this video.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.260]   Well, that's a good, that's filler.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   Conversation conversation.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:33:03.980]   I want to see a chart of my skin colors through the year pink, pink or pinkest.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.740]   Twit.tv/bestof to contribute.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.340]   And by the way, don't forget that then two weeks, the week after Christmas, so next week
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.100]   we'll be here Christmas day, we will be doing the best of the week after that New Year's
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:25.820]   day. I will actually, I will have been broadcasting all day before because of New Year's Eve.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.220]   We're doing the 24 hours of New Year's.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.500]   So I, do I have to come in Chad and do this week in Google the next day?
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.340]   I don't think we've thought about this.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.540]   I don't think we have a contingency plan for that yet.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.540]   I may be in jammies.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.540]   Of course you do.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.540]   You may, of course I do says Matthew.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.540]   Of course you do.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.180]   Yeah, I noticed that Om gets to go to Paris.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.180]   What about you Matthew?
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.460]   They leave you the keys of the blog and said that I'll see you later.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.820]   I'm in the web.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.300]   Leo, you'll be, you'll get to go to sleep at 4 a.m.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   That's true.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.940]   I'll have plenty of rest of the time.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.580]   You'll have at least, yeah.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.860]   Well, we are doing security now the day before, so maybe we, I could just come in at noon
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   or one.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.900]   Maybe we should move all your shows on Tuesday to that day because we have 24 hours to fill.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   We'll figure it out.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.900]   We will.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.300]   I'm going to be drinking champagne 27 times in that 24 hours.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.140]   There are 27 New Year's countdowns and we're going to do each one.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.380]   Many of them we hope will be Skypes to that region.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.860]   So we'll welcome 2014, 27.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.340]   You're going to be hammered.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.340]   You could say that.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.540]   You're going to be unintelligible.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.980]   I don't know what I'm going to be, but it's part of the amusement of all this is watching
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.020]   me dissolve.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.140]   Bit by bit by bit.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.140]   You know what?
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.140]   Somebody's got a good idea.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.500]   I'll Skype in for the shows via my Xbox one.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   I have a nice recliner.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.380]   I'll be lying there like this.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.580]   What do you think?
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:58.380]   It's like what Howard Stern has callers who fall asleep while they're on hold.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.500]   They leaves the one snoring.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.820]   I think he's had one on for an hour.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.820]   Just really?
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.820]   Oh yeah.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.820]   It's a good joke.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820]   It's a great joke.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.140]   Are you going to go to sleep?
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   It's brilliant.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:16.140]   You had us go running across town to bang on the door and wake them up.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.140]   I have no idea.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.260]   I mean, I've done these before.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.340]   We did a 24 hours of iPhone when the iPhone came out.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.100]   That was in 2008.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.820]   We did it on tech TV.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.260]   We did the call for help with thons.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:31.660]   So I've done this before, but I was a lot younger.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.460]   All I could say, one word, catheter.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:42.660]   Our show today brought to you by hover.com.

[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.660]   Not lots of clicks to get a domain name.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.860]   And of course, they know when you want a domain, you're going to want privacy.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.060]   So that's included in the price.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.940]   Like who is privacy subdomains URL forwarding hover.com.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.980]   They are the best.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.820]   They only offer services that enhance the domain name experience.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.860]   The only partner with companies, they believe, offer customers their best value.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.580]   Just like us.

[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.060]   you know, changing addresses in the future.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.060]   Hover's honest.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.300]   Hover is the way to do it.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:35.060]   I want you to go to hover.com, h-o-v-e-r.com/twig.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.260]   And take a look at what Hover has to offer, including Google Apps for business.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.300]   You don't have to be a big business to do this.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.620]   A family could do it.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.220]   A club, a group.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.660]   You get everything you love about the full suite of Google productivity, apps, Gmail,
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.940]   Calendar, Drive, Docs, the whole package.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.860]   25 gigs of storage.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.780]   And support from Hover, which is really nice.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.860]   I mean, this is a great...
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.100]   If you're not sure if this is right for you, there is a 30-day trial to see what you think.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.100]   I think this is a great idea, a great way to use Google Apps.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.180]   Hover offers all the big top-level domains.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.100]   Of course.com, a lot of the dot coms are gone, but they have a full range of dot nets.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.700]   And I think that is really probably the next best choice.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.940]   .org.tv.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.380]   That's what we use.pro.moby.biz.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:25.340]   And now.io, they also have country designations.ca.us.asia.uk.

[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.220]   We encourage you to do the same.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.420]   Matthew Ingram is here from Gig Aum.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.020]   Jeff Jarvis, to the University of New York.
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.060]   Gina has the week off.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.140]   Nice to have you both.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.260]   It's the upworthy problem.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.460]   All of a sudden, I don't know about you, but all of a sudden I'm seeing all these
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.740]   upworthy posts in my Facebook feed.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.020]   And now, upworthy's not new.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.660]   I thought maybe upworthy's doing something really good.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:24.820]   They do, you know, they have these great headlines that make you feel good about life.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:30.860]   And then when you go to watch that silly kitty video at Upworthy, they make sure that
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:40.140]   you have a big button that says, "Pass it on," and they have a big Facebook button.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:46.820]   But there is another reason why Upworthy's showing up all the time in your Facebook feed.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.980]   Matthew, you wrote about this.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.020]   I mean, the biggest reason is Facebook.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:01.220]   So the same time that Twitter's IPO happened.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.860]   What did Facebook do?
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.780]   They are fiddling with the algorithms that run their news feed.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:12.460]   And so they're, interestingly enough, it sounds to me at least as though they actually
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:18.660]   want to downplay things like Upworthy and Buzzfeed.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.020]   What gets on the top of the feed now?
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:26.220]   For some reason, Dan Lyons, fake Steve Jobs, lives at the top of my news feed now.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.220]   I've seen a bunch too.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.540]   And I think it was Buzzfeed wrote about, "Some sites are seeing huge increases in the
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.540]   amount of traffic that Facebook is sending them."
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.380]   So they're clearly fiddling with the gears that determine what gets displayed and what
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.780]   doesn't.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.820]   And Upworthy's incredibly viral content.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.420]   I see it dozens of times in my Twitter stream and my Facebook feed.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.420]   I don't want to.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.300]   Have you seen the UpworthyGenerator.com?
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   It's become a cliche.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.700]   It's just as Buzzfeed has become its own cliche.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.180]   Upworthy has become its own cliche.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.580]   And all it is is the old scummy guy.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   I was a tabloid guy.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.580]   I wrote those headlines.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.100]   I know what it's like to do that.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   And it's tabloid.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   That's all it is.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   Upworthy generator.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.300]   Here's an Upworthy Generated headline.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:22.060]   Try not to let your jaw hit the floor when you hear these two words and then a video
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.660]   of one crying.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.140]   And how can you not click on that?
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.500]   Let's create another.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.980]   This is so awesome.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:35.180]   Watch a legendary high schooler become a role model with one question.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.380]   Their favorite is this guy did something and you'll never believe what happened next.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.180]   Here's what happens when a director stands up for people who can't.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.020]   And a teary woman.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.260]   Here's what happens when an NBA coach gets real about the biggest problem in America.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.140]   You sound like real headlines.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.420]   You need to drop everything.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.260]   And here the tear jerking two words this trailblazing author found.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.020]   And then a woman in tears.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.020]   It's it's.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   You know what?
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.020]   People click on them.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:14.820]   Like in a way it reminds me of of spam the early days of spam.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.620]   The reason why they did those things was because people clicked on them and up here
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.620]   he works because people click on them.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.900]   Well, you know what it's interesting.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:29.300]   I talked to Tony Hale, the founder and CEO of Chartbeat, a wonderful company that does
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.500]   great analytics on on pages.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.380]   And and we need to have Tony on some time.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.500]   But he said that what they're finding in part is that a lot of people share things before
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.740]   they read them.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   And so the belief that oh it's shared it got it got read.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.420]   It's really just really engaged people, not necessarily.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.540]   You just kind of see that little reflexive moment and you send it off to somebody else.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.900]   And you're and that's how this crap rises.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.100]   Well, and people see a headline like, you know, this coach did something amazing to stop
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.260]   racism or something.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.740]   Well, you want to be seen as someone who doesn't like racism.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.740]   So you're going to share it.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.740]   It doesn't matter what it says.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.740]   And you don't read it.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.740]   No, of course not.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.740]   You don't watch the video.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.980]   Who has time for that?
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.540]   I only have time to share.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.260]   And in fact, Twitter, I was just noticing today the the mobile version, you know, they've
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.580]   added retweet buttons right below the content.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.860]   So you don't have to click on the tweet.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.700]   And so you can retweet it literally without even reading it.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.740]   It's much more convenient that way.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.580]   Don't you see this too, Matthew, is all the time I'll put up a post and I'll tweet it.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.300]   And before anyone could possibly have read the post, I start getting reaction.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   And retweets.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:46.220]   And I know some of it is bots, like some in particular Mashable stuff gets retweeted 500
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.860]   times before even a robot could read the text because everyone's trying to sort of draft
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   off of their social.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.060]   But and the comparison for me to upworthy is SEO.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.060]   So SEO headlines.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.300]   Remember when we were all upset about those?
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.060]   This is sort of a similar thing.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.060]   It's emotional SEO.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:12.380]   You know, so these headlines are sort of being being sort of calculated to tuck at your heart
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.180]   strings and human heart string optimization.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:20.300]   Yeah, except it's going to fail for the same reason SEO did.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   People will get used to it.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   That cuts.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.020]   So now all the time, right?
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.140]   They're all like Matt cuts.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:32.060]   So and you know, Google and Facebook are both going to right particularly Facebook is tweaking
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.260]   its algorithm to try and drive that stuff down.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.980]   I think what is Facebook trying to accomplish?
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.780]   What's a bit about Facebook wanting to be a new news front page?
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.740]   What do you what do you take on that?
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.580]   So well, that's what I wrote about today because I you know, the queue for you, Matthew.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:55.980]   Yes, Mike, Mike Isaac, talk to some anonymous sources at Facebook about what Chris Cox,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.620]   the VP of product thinks about and what Mark Zuckerberg thinks about when they when they
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.540]   think about what they want the newsfeed to do.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.940]   And what they wanted to be is like a newspaper, a place where you get all the stuff that's
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.940]   important to you.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:13.540]   And so the tension there is obviously lots of people just want to share cat gifts and
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:19.340]   photos of their child or whatever stupid things like up worthy posts.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.820]   So but Facebook doesn't want them to do that.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:27.820]   Facebook wants it to be high quality and sort of important in a way.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.180]   Well, is there algorithm looking at what I what what is there algorithm look at what
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.940]   I consider high quality or what is generally considered high quality?
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.460]   I think it's looking at what's generally considered high quality.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.820]   That's where it fails.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.140]   There were some other sort of clues.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.340]   You know, a lot of this is sort of trying to it's smoke and mirrors in a way.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.300]   So it's all suggestions.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.380]   And so Peter Kafka talked to someone about the newsfeed and they said, you know, we
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:45:00.180]   want fewer internet memes and more kind of thousand word serious analytical pieces.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:06.140]   But I'm not clear on whether that's because people seem to like a thousand word analytical
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:11.220]   pieces or because Facebook wants them to like long analytical pieces.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.220]   And you know, what are they?
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.260]   They see internet memes or be are getting tired.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.500]   I don't know.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.380]   Well, I think they want to feed.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.900]   Let's put it to me at least.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.380]   I think they want the feed to be more serious because they're hoping that it will attract
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   advertisers.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   That's my own sense.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.180]   Obviously, you know, that's funny.
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.620]   Newspapers don't attract advertisers.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:39.100]   And you know, my point was newspapers as sort of gatekeepers, the problem comes when
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.580]   editors decide that they know what you should read and you don't.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.420]   And so, and I think that's part of the tension between newspapers and other ways of consuming
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.420]   information.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.220]   If Facebook just wants to take over that role and say, we're going to show you a bunch of
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.420]   stuff that you're not actually interested in, we think we got people to do that.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.420]   We don't need to.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.420]   We have people do that.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   There's not a lot of future in that.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   Don't we know, Matthew?
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.420]   Right.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:08.340]   You say in your article on gigahome.com that Facebook, actually you're quoting a Mac
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:14.260]   Isaac, but Facebook is delaying support for animated gifts for this reason, fearing that
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.660]   the stream will fill with memes.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.860]   And they specifically, like Chris Cox, the VP of product has apparently specifically
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.020]   mentioned that he doesn't like Buzzfeed.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.420]   And so, you know, if I was Buzzfeed, that would certainly make me a little nervous because
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   Facebook is a huge platform.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   And a lot of the-
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.940]   Yeah, how much of their referrals come from Facebook?
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.940]   Right.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.180]   So a lot of that sort of brings up the same issues around building your business based
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.820]   on, you know, sharing through another platform.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.100]   If Facebook suddenly decides like they did with social readers, remember when the Guardian
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.180]   in Washington Post had social readers and their content was shared millions and millions
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.180]   of times.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.780]   And Facebook made a tiny change in the algorithm.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   Boom.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.780]   Dead.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.780]   Well, you know, especially in their manner, too, it goes back to your analogy about SEO.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.260]   Twitter puts your feed in whatever you asked for.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.220]   There's no algorithm in the way.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   Facebook has an algorithm in the way.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.540]   Google Plus has an algorithm in the way.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.620]   SEO is an algorithm in the way.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.980]   Those are the new gatekeepers.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.740]   And so they can adjust for these things.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:22.180]   And so yeah, BuzzFeed figured out how to game Facebook.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.100]   And Facebook is evidently going to fight back, whether they have the right formula for what
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.100]   people want.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   But if they don't, they're going to see the numbers around the back.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.100]   They're going to stop.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.100]   They care about engagement.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.220]   And in a way, it's like, so you figured out a trick, you know, that involves card counting
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220]   or something.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   You're at the tables in Vegas.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.580]   Well, the house always wins, right?
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.300]   Facebook is the house.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:49.420]   So, and you say, your headline kind of says it, Matthew, the new, meet the new boss just
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.860]   like the old boss.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:57.940]   And if you have any question as to what Facebook's motivation is, note that while they haven't
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:04.700]   turned on animated GIFs or GIFs, they have turned on videos that auto play in the stream.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   Right.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   Exact.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.500]   Extremely annoying, but something advertisers would obviously won't.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   Incredibly annoying.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.340]   And a big part of this is it's obscure, right?
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.900]   The same way newspapers were obscure.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.660]   You didn't know why the editors were choosing those stories that were on the front page.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.260]   You don't know why Facebook is showing you certain things in your stream and not other
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.260]   things.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.660]   You don't know whether it's because of the advertising to pay them to or because their
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.460]   algorithm says certain things about you, you just have no clue.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.420]   And I feel like we can see it now.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.660]   I mean, I can, I noticed this algorithmic because it's not, it's weird.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.580]   And I'm seeing Dan Lyons like every other post that's, can't be right.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.740]   And the same thing with Google plus.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.500]   So do you think Jeff, this means Twitter wins because it is on there's no intermediary?
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.420]   Well, or does it lose because it can be junked up with.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   It's mimefied.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.100]   And even it has started changing.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.420]   It's no longer just the sort of chronological, for example, conversations.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   I don't know what you think about that, but where, where tweets are connected by a blue
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.260]   line.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.300]   Those actually alter the flow of Twitter.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.260]   So you will see old tweets show up.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.940]   In fact, I see multiple conversations multiple times.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.060]   Sometimes that's interesting because it might be a conversation I didn't see.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.940]   Sometimes it's hugely irritating.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.340]   By the way, I love you, Dan Lyons.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.460]   I'm not, I don't want you to think as I follow him.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.460]   And I think he's great.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.620]   And I think he's hysterical.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:32.260]   And we're going to have him on our show soon, but it's just an example.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.820]   But I look through my Facebook feed.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.820]   Okay.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.220]   So the number one post from a guy I follow is from I can't believe it.org.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.300]   Strange and improbable animal friendships, 30 pictures.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.820]   I'm going to click on all of these.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.540]   Then there's an ad for free meals from Plated.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.780]   I don't know what that is and I'll care.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   Boy, I got that ad too.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.100]   And by the way, go, put me a favor, go back up and look at the label on that label on
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.820]   top of that ad says, I think it's like recommended post or something.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.820]   Oh, it doesn't.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.820]   Yes.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.820]   Suggested post.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.820]   It doesn't say ad.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.940]   It does down below say sponsored.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:03.940]   It is.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:08.020]   But Bob suggested by who suggested by the advertiser who paid us good money.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.460]   That's just it.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.100]   Then this is very annoying.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:18.220]   And I think maybe it also has to do with the new call out, the way these articles are called
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   out.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.500]   They really feel like, you know, here's college humor.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.540]   Here's HubSpot, which is Dan's company.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.660]   Here's your chance to write a happy ending for the most heartwarming Christmas story ever.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.340]   Obviously HubSpot has figured this out.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.580]   That's an upwardly headline.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:36.420]   That's very upwardly and it's got a picture of a guy and you want to know more and what
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.300]   is the most heartwarming Christmas story ever.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.540]   I've got to find out.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:46.860]   You know, I mean, my feet is full of this crap and it doesn't really endear me to it.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.780]   It's become very obvious that it's algorithmic, right?
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.380]   And you have no control over it, right?
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.620]   And you don't know what's happening or why.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.420]   You can use the pull down and say hide this post and then maybe it will or maybe it won't.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:03.220]   You can use the pull down to say, you know, block this user, but you don't have a lot of
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.260]   fine grained control over what you see and what you don't see.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.780]   And then there's this poor Trey Radcliffe, great photographer, love him, got a capital
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.620]   one ad because Trey Radcliffe likes capital one.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.820]   And I bet you anything, Trey Radcliffe couldn't care less about capital.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.820]   You know what?
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:23.580]   I've been seeing those a lot too and I've been making a point of asking the people who supposedly
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.140]   liked that thing, whether they liked it.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.900]   And over 50% of them said no, they never did.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.540]   Well, that's really bad.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   That's really bad.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.820]   Yeah, I don't know how that even happened.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:36.940]   Trey lives in New Zealand, I doubt very much he has a capital one credit card.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.580]   I'd be shocked if he does.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.740]   So how did that get in there?
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:40.740]   So how did that get in there?
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.740]   Algorithm liking things on their behalf?
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.060]   Well, I could tell you the upshot.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.860]   I visit Facebook much less than I used to a lot.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.620]   I hardly ever go there now.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:56.180]   And I think they're actually shooting themselves in the foot if what they want to become is
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:01.820]   a newspaper that chooses things for you to see based on what they think is quote unquote
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.900]   high quality or serious or or whatever they want to call it.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.180]   Yeah, it's about the content.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.980]   It's about your friends.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:09.980]   Facebook is a connection.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.460]   I want to see my friends and family and what they're up to.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.580]   And if they're sharing some stupid, upworthy or buzzfeed thing, that's fine.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:18.820]   That's what they're up to.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.100]   That's what they're doing.
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.900]   And I'm getting a lot of people who I follow.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.940]   I mean, obviously these are all people you have to be people you follow right in your
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:30.260]   newsfeed, except for the advertisers.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:37.300]   But I remember I mentioned in the post, I remember in 2011, Larry Page was talking to, I'm trying
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.540]   to remember who it was now at an event about Google News.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:46.580]   And this person was complaining that Google News was just full of frivolous stories and
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.340]   there wasn't enough important kind of journalism surfaced in Google News.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.180]   And Larry Page said, yeah, you know what, you're right.
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.180]   We should fix that.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.660]   We should make more important stories show up.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.140]   And my alarm bells went off.
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.020]   And I started thinking, well, I don't want Larry Page to decide what the important stories
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.020]   are in my Google News.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.020]   Well, but they do already.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.020]   Matthew, they do already.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.020]   There's already the shoes.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.020]   I know they do.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.020]   I know they do.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.020]   The shoes.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.020]   And based on various things and some odd things get up.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.580]   So they're already in control of that.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.500]   But that was what appealed to me about Google News.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.420]   I love the idea of a machine doing it, unbiased machine doing it.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:23.260]   And they pick some, they pick authoritative sources and then let a machine.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.900]   But it's not that obviously it's tweaked, highly tweaked.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.300]   And it's obviously based on what the accumulation of media are doing.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.940]   So right now the top story is how to vote Thursday on budget deal.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.220]   The signal that the algorithm gets is my God, everybody's right about a budget deal must
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.220]   be important.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.260]   So so it's already the the agglomeration of the media.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.540]   Facebook's playing a dangerous game here, I think.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.860]   A lot of the problem is the black box issue, right?
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.180]   You don't know what Google's algorithm is doing.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.540]   You don't know what Facebook's algorithm is doing.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.460]   There's no option to say, I want to see more of these things, less of those things.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.460]   So there's no obvious way to do that.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:02.940]   And so I think that's important to you, Matthew, is that I think, and I guess there's some
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.780]   new editing possible on the Google News Android app, which I haven't, I haven't gotten yet
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   and played with.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.620]   But I've always been surprised at Google News, which is moving toward relevance and personalization
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:16.740]   elsewhere away from the one size fits all search result, for example, that Google News
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.260]   being one size fits all is rather absurd to me.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.100]   Yeah, I could pick certain categories, but that's not that's not learning enough.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:27.140]   I know and I keep saying it over and over and over if for the last probably three, four
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:32.620]   years, I don't understand why Google, they've got to have reams of information that would
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.020]   allow them to help you customize Google News.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.260]   And yet they seem to have no interest in doing that whatsoever.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:47.380]   I just don't understand it.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.380]   Let's take a break and come back.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.500]   I want to get our timing right on this one.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.140]   We got Matthew Ingram, Gigo, here.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.140]   It's great to have him.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:58.500]   Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York, public parts, Buzz machine.com.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.500]   It's such a rare opportunity to get you two guys together.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.220]   I mean, this is really a good time to talk a little bit about media and stuff like that.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.180]   But there's some other stuff to talk about to.
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.220]   We'll get to get to all of it.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.780]   Well, not all of it, much of it, just a little bit.
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.740]   Holy cow, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.100]   And first a word from Atlassian, the creators of Jira.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.100]   Atlassian Jira.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:31.060]   Now, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com/Twig is the place to go to find out about Jira, the project
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:37.420]   management solution, completely customizable, completely powerful, that will capture and
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.740]   organize your workflow so you can prioritize it and take action on what's important without
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.940]   giving up the tools you love.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.420]   It keeps you up to date on the activity going on around you.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:53.940]   You can easily capture your teams, issues, tasks, features, bugs, prioritize them as
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.940]   you go.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:00.340]   Easy to use, interface it, integrates all your documents, including your Google Apps, your
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:05.020]   backlog, your issues, your code repository works with all the big code repositories.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:12.100]   Of course, that's why Jira is used now by 20,000 companies, 70% of the Fortune 100.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.620]   NASA uses it.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.220]   That's a project management, right?
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.300]   You go into Mars, use Jira.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:23.660]   You can even build on to Jira yourself with the REST APIs Atlassian offers flexible and
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.780]   simple, enough for a five-person startup, powerful and reliable enough for a 100,000-person
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   enterprise.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.380]   You can go infinitely, really, in any direction with hundreds of Jira add-ons, test management,
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.300]   time tracking, project management.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:41.420]   If you've got code, you can do it from the initial planning doc right through the files
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.180]   and changes in your code repository all the way to deployment.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:50.540]   Contract work smarter and faster, very affordable.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:55.740]   And I think you're going to see why so many big companies like Twitter and NASA and eBay
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:59.540]   and Cisco and Adobe and Hulu and everybody else uses it.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:04.940]   J-I-R-A, that's from Gojira.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.620]   And it's an Atlassian product.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:12.100]   You can find out more at Atlassian.com/tweig.
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:19.220]   By the way, monthly plans start at $10 a month for up to 10 users and it's free for 30 days
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.500]   when you go to Atlassian.com/tweig.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.780]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:31.340]   Apple TV is getting live news from Bloomberg TV today.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:35.740]   I keep wishing we could get our live stuff on Apple TV, but Apple is really the ultimate
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.740]   gatekeeper, right?
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.460]   How big is Apple TV?
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.260]   Do we have any sense of the metrics for that?
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.740]   Yeah, 31 million units.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.740]   It's not huge.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.980]   It's the biggest set top box Roku.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:52.700]   Last time I checked, this is a few months ago, Roku I think was at 13 million.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.920]   And then it trails off rapidly after that.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:00.680]   But you know, Time Magazine said the Chromecast is the gadget of the year 2013 and Google's
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.500]   Chromecast added I think 10 new channels.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:10.460]   I guess what it seems to be now is that Google has become is the gatekeeper.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.020]   And what they want to do is do kind of big rollouts.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.420]   So they want to do it in clumps.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.220]   So HBO Go, which I was watching the other day on my Chromecast, that's awesome.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:24.340]   Vivo, the music service beyond pod, which is a podcasting client.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:28.260]   Unfortunately, paid a podcasting client and you have to have the paid version to get the
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.140]   Chromecast working.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:37.700]   Some oddball stuff, Vicky, which is, I don't know what it is, Korean and anime and...
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.380]   Yeah, it's an odd list.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.140]   It's not a very exciting list.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.940]   Hulu Plus, though, that's exciting.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.180]   Pandora's been out for a while.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:51.140]   So I don't know how well these are selling, but I think Chromecast is getting more and
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.740]   more interesting, isn't it?
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.740]   And that was the idea.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.260]   And it's so easy to use and it's so cheap.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:03.940]   So then the new stuff includes Red Bull TV, inspirational programming from Red Bull.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.940]   Songs is great.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.940]   It's a music service.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.940]   I love that.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:10.100]   It means you can, and this is important, play local content.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.580]   Yeah, Plex is great.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   Through your Chromecast.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:17.780]   So if you've got a Plex server, you have to pay for the paid version of it for this right
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.260]   now, although I bet it'll go free.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:26.580]   Post from the Washington Post, Post TV, Vicky, and the real player cloud.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.380]   I didn't even know real player was still in this.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:33.180]   But yeah, I was going to say, oh, real player, oh, no, no, stay away.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.180]   It's not like that anymore.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.180]   I know it was the most hated.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:37.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.180]   Service.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.420]   They announced this real player cloud a few months ago, and I'm not sure exactly what
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.420]   it does, but.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.660]   Can you get friends around there?
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.660]   My space?
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.780]   Ah, those were such a good times.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.580]   Real player cloud enables you to move, watch, and share your videos.
[00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:01.940]   The idea is that you can watch your own content and including some, you know, Divx and MKV
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.940]   and XVID and some of the oddball formats.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.900]   So I don't think you have to install a real player on your Chromecast.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:15.700]   I think it's just you installing on your iPhone, your Android phone, and the real player cloud
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.380]   is what you need to install.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.300]   I like the idea that you can play your own local videos, finally, without the tabcast.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.900]   That was kind of always a little funky.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.540]   So now you got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.700]   thirteen, fourteen services.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.660]   And now we are not a revision threes in there.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.540]   We are not.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:40.780]   I think that's because revision three, first of all, is Discovery Channel's company and
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.900]   that helps.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.380]   But I think they also have their own app.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.780]   I know Houdini seven, we have, our apps are not done in house, they're done by third
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.660]   parties who decide to, they're volunteers.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.100]   And I know Houdini seven said he was going to add Chromecast capability to his Twit app
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.540]   for iOS and Android.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.380]   The problem is I think that Google has to approve you.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.100]   And so you have to be in some sort of.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.980]   And I presume that this is what we're going to start seeing is every week or so leading
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.820]   up to the holiday.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   I guess you get two more weeks before Christmas.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.220]   They'll announce another chunk of stuff.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.100]   You can stream us from a Chrome tab.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   That does work.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.500]   Houdini seven says, yeah, I'm just waiting on Google.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.860]   Houdini is Craig Molani of Shift Key Software.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.020]   He says he's waiting on Google approval.
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.220]   So Craig, we're going to be in touch because I think what we want to do is see if we can
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.260]   hello Google, Pawnee Strings.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   Hello Google.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   Are you there?
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.260]   Is there anyone there for Google?
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.900]   Anybody at Google are you out there?
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.820]   Please, please let us do our Chromecast.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.820]   Please.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.420]   It's all we ask.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.940]   Please let us Chromecast.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.580]   I would like that.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580]   I would too.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:01.860]   But right now I was watching HBO Go, watching Deadwood on Chromecast this morning.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.460]   And it was great.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.460]   Looks good.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.460]   It works well.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.460]   They have the new interface.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.460]   It's nice.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.300]   It's a slideshow every 10 seconds.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   Beautiful pictures.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.180]   I noticed one of them was by Peter Norvig.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:18.420]   So I wonder if the pictures on the backgrounds of the Chromecast now are all Google employees
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.340]   or where they're getting them.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.660]   They give credit to everybody and they rotate through them, which is neat.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.540]   So yeah, good way to start the morning.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.540]   Deadwood.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.940]   I like to start the morning with prostitutes.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.820]   I'm almost caught up with Walking Dead.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.900]   I've been catching up with the entirety of it.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   See, I can't watch that in the morning.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.900]   Yeah, me neither actually.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.740]   Too squeamish.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.740]   But I do watch True Blood sometimes in the morning, so who knows?
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740]   Boy, what's up?
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.140]   Sorry, we're going to go off topic here badly.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.980]   I started watching the tape of the Sound of Music with--
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.660]   That was the worst thing I ever saw.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.660]   Holy cow.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:06.100]   And the guy from True Blood had this great reputation as a sexy smart star.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.100]   Vampire Bill.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.100]   Oh.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.100]   And his whistle.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.100]   He was terrible.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.660]   It was mind-boggling.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.700]   It wasn't bad enough to be entertaining.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.180]   That was the only thing that disappointed me.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:22.500]   I was so hoping it would be so bad that I would laugh my way through it instead.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.580]   It was right in that valley where it's just bad but not so bad that it's enjoyable.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:32.220]   Now, if I had at the time been playing the Sound of Music drinking game--
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.220]   Oh, not one.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.580]   So you know how these work.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.980]   You watch a show and then you take a sip if--
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   I don't know.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.060]   --every time somebody yodels.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:48.740]   Every time the captain blows his whistle, every time you see a Nazi or every time something
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.180]   unintentionally funny happens.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.940]   Now, you take two sips every time someone's accent falters in the first 10 minutes, like
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940]   18 sips.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]   You be handling that.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.180]   Carry on, would keep slipping in the country twang.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.700]   How do you solve a problem like Mariah?
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:08.180]   Every time a song sounds twangier than you remember every time a kid messes up, the kids
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.180]   were good.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.820]   They were, actually.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.100]   Those were good kids.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.940]   It was the grown-ups who sucked.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.660]   Take three sips every time an adult messes up.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.500]   Every time Carrie Unward is a little too sexy to be a nun, didn't have any of those.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:30.060]   And every time vampire Bill looks like he might eat one of the Von Trapp kids.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.060]   It was pretty funny.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.860]   I don't know.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.660]   TV critic Jeff Jarvis.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.660]   Well, they're going to do a huge ratings.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660]   Did it?
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.660]   18 million audience.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.340]   They said they're going to do another musical live event.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.340]   I love live.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.660]   I think that's great.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.820]   I think the only mistake they made was casting.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   You know what's great?
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.820]   Audra Sagan.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.820]   So the direction.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.780]   Well, oh, I know what the real mistake they made.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.780]   And I hope they don't do this again.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.740]   They had no live audience.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.620]   It was just a bunch of people on a sound stage.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:11.740]   And you, I mean, I'm telling you, the whole point of something like this is the feedback
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.940]   loop between the audience and the cast members.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.260]   And let them play through some odd staging where they could go back, you know, they could
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.820]   open up and they're in their back in the Abbey immediately and yeah, and that kind of
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:21.820]   stuff.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:23.900]   Audra McDonald was amazing in it though.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.900]   She can sing.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.900]   She was the.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.980]   Seeking actually saying that the head sister, whatever they call that she really can't.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.980]   But was she good.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.420]   And it was so interesting to see somebody who can actually act and sing.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.780]   Carrie's got a great voice.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.100]   She's wonderful, you know, but she can't act.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.580]   And so it was really interesting to see the two of them paired off.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.580]   Carrie.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.580]   That was also interesting.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   It was the.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580]   Sorry.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:53.140]   It was, I noticed that Twitter in particular, you know, one of their big sort of selling
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:58.140]   points is that it makes live events like that more enjoyable.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:03.700]   And I, since I was watching it anyway, because my daughters and wife were watching it.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   Oh, sure.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.700]   You sure.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.260]   We know you wanted to watch it.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.060]   You know, just fast up, fella, you're Canadian.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.060]   You're literally.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:15.260]   Twitter made it more enjoyable because it, you know, there was live snark sort of while
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:19.220]   it was going on and basically live reviews of the show as was going on.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.220]   So mad that I didn't launch Twitter.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.860]   But see, we're in the Western time zone.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.060]   So it's kind of screwed up.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.060]   Right.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060]   All the Twitter people.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.620]   I see the, you know, first three hours earlier, all of the tweets.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.740]   A lot of them going, Nazis, Nazis, that seemed to be a big one.
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.460]   Someone should offer a feature where you can watch something you, you recorded or you're
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:44.660]   in the wrong time zone and you can, you can time code the tweets.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.860]   So the stream.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.500]   Sun Jake was going to, was going to build that app years ago.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   Didn't.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.340]   What a great idea.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.740]   You should be able to watch something socially, whatever you want to watch it.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.740]   And just pull all that.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.740]   I already have Twitter as it adds the necessity of live.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.780]   We got away from live and everything except sports.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.180]   And now an event like that, you're right.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.700]   It's, it's so much worse if you don't have Twitter.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.220]   So I paused like a commercial or something or I paused, someone came to the door.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:17.500]   I think it wasn't sound of music, but it was the Oscars or something.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.220]   And it was all at a sink with the people.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.220]   I know.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   Right.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:28.780]   So according to the times, a network is buoyed by the sound of music ratings.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.540]   NBC says we're going to do it all again.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.140]   18.6 million viewers, which isn't a huge number.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.140]   Is it?
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.140]   Now these days though.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.140]   These days.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.140]   That's pretty big.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.140]   And is that watched?
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:48.180]   That's, anybody watched five seconds of accounts in that number, of course.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:51.580]   And that's the question is how many of those 18.6 million were still watching in the second
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:08:03.460]   hour and the third and the fourth and the fifth.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.260]   So they're going to do, what's, what are they going to do next?
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]   It doesn't say here.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.260]   They say they're going to do another one though.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.460]   I was surprised there wasn't a hashtag popping up with suggestions.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:14.860]   What would be the crowd pleaser?
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.180]   You mean a musical or?
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   Life musical.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.180]   Story.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.180]   Oh, I saw story.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.180]   Of course.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.180]   Stick with the same one.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180]   Who are they cast?
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.020]   Mmm.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.860]   I don't know the young people today.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.180]   Miley as Maria.
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.180]   Miley.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.780]   Kim Kardashian could be in there.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.340]   I want to be in America.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.020]   I like to stay in America.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.180]   Russell Crow for sure.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.180]   Russell Crow.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.860]   He's in everything.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.100]   He should be in everything.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.700]   Even though he can't say he's saying it.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:53.060]   Let me say, I believe didn't he?
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.580]   The miserable as he did.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.180]   It was more of a shout than a saying.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.180]   It was.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   Gruff kind of.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.180]   Oh, I don't want to be.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.180]   John, John.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.700]   He's a young out at her hockey game.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:13.340]   That's the worst call since they cast Russell Crow and then withdraw.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:21.740]   Google says 91.4% to be precise of non spam email sent to Gmail users are now authenticated
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.460]   using anti fishing standards.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.980]   Have you explained that to me?
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.140]   You know what's so funny?
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.660]   I was going to ask you.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.140]   There's two systems that are used.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.740]   And it's up to your ISP or your email provider to do this.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.540]   The domain key identified email or sender policy framework.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.580]   The reason there's two is because Microsoft wanted one.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.460]   Everybody else wanted another.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.140]   How does that guarantee you're not a fisher?
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:52.060]   It authenticates you that this is coming from your domain that this is you sending it.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.060]   Right.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:57.820]   So it's in effect, it's like without your knowledge, it's in the background signing it.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.820]   It stops spoofing.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:04.100]   And if you're going to fish or spam, you don't want to you're going to spoof.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.140]   You don't want your real email on there.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.140]   Right.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   Right.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.140]   Okay.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   Now I understand.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.140]   Thank you.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.020]   Interestingly, a lot of ISPs hedged their bet and did both 74%.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:21.940]   Almost 75 are both D Kim and SPF over half a million domains are using DKIM.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:28.060]   SPF, which I think is the Microsoft standard is only three and a half million domains.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.260]   Anyway, that's good.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.660]   It is the way to end spam and certainly is effective in fishing too is to have authenticated
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.660]   email.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.420]   The problem is users don't want to do anything.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.580]   So this is all done kind of behind their backs.
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:44.580]   SPF is also the sunscreen.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:55.820]   It has an SPF of 30 for no spam passing through.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.820]   I made my memory and this is pretty.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:09.180]   This is old stuff, but yeah, it was Microsoft's sender ID framework SPF.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.180]   Sender policy framework.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.860]   So that's good news anyway.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:19.260]   So the time has come for us to go to the store to buy presents.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:22.580]   We can't afford for people who won't like them.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:25.220]   We call it Christmas.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.100]   I haven't bought something my wife that she likes it.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.900]   I don't know how many years I try the kids laugh.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.580]   Now, does she OK this is good because I have the same problem.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.620]   Does she covertly bring it back?
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.980]   No, no, God, no, not not my family.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.820]   Does her face fall when she opens the bar?
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:40.820]   You get a snarl.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.820]   Immediately a snarl.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.980]   Oh, yeah, I know it's it's there.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.900]   Her family and my family kind of like in trouble, but her family and my family were raised differently,
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.900]   right?
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.580]   In her family, they would just say straight up.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   Why did you get this?
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:53.580]   Is she Italian?
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.580]   No, German.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.580]   German.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.140]   My family, we would always and it's reflex.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.900]   I can't stop it this day before somebody opens the present.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.900]   You say we can return it.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.900]   That's me.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   I get the sort of falls.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   I get the oh, that's great.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   Don't worry.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   You can.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   Oh, that's even worse.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   The passive aggressive.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   Oh, that's so nice.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.540]   But you know, it's not.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.500]   You know, it's not.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.580]   So all the women in my life always resort to the same thing.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.300]   They tell me what to get them.
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.300]   I'm good.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.300]   I'm in.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   I would love that.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.300]   I would love that.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.300]   She or your wife won't do that.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.380]   No, because she wants to be surprised by something she doesn't want.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.140]   No, no, it's just that we kind of don't need anything.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.740]   Well, no, nobody needs anything.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.940]   So that is the problem.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:40.940]   That is the problem.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.940]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.980]   At a time if you're over 15, you don't need it.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.980]   It's only plus it's only.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.980]   It's only.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:46.980]   It's only.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.380]   I have to have a sentence by your 2434.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.380]   Right.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.380]   Right.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.380]   That's not the things that I really want.
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.820]   You know, I want my Nexus 5.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.500]   I'm not waiting for somebody to buy it for me.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.820]   I'm going to buy myself the Nexus 5.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.820]   I'm grown up.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.820]   I get it.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.820]   Well, don't.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.460]   Yeah, we get geek shouldn't nobody ever should buy a gadget for a geek.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.740]   No, that's just going to.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   That's a doomed.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   Yes.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.900]   But that's what, but okay.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.420]   So this is like buying jewelry or clothes.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.780]   I see this guy's on sexist for our spouse.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.700]   We're going down a rabbit hole here.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.700]   I know is little about jewelry and clothes.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.340]   Yes.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.580]   As we might imagine.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.900]   You're right.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900]   There's no winning this.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.740]   I can't finish this sentence without Saturday.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.220]   I have daughters.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.980]   And so now my oldest is old enough.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.140]   I just get hurt by everything.
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:41.140]   Because A, she knows what's good and what's good.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:44.620]   And B, she knows what her mother wants and what she doesn't want.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.660]   And so like I just outsource all my shopping to her.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   That's smart.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.180]   You see my, you see what kids buy you something you hate.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.180]   That's cute.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.900]   Like my son last year, he's 18.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:02.100]   Last year, and I hope he's not listening right now, he bought me a novel.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.540]   He buys me books, which is great by Michael Savage.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.660]   And he said, it looked really good.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.340]   And I just, oh, that's great.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.340]   Thank you so much.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.340]   I didn't tell him.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.820]   Yeah, I used to work with him at KSOF and San Francisco.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.220]   The man is a nutcase.
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:17.900]   What did you do with it?
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.300]   Like you go, can you do it on my bookshelf?
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.300]   Okay.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.820]   I know the other great thing is my, well, let's just prove this way.
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.180]   Grandparents can also buy magnificently ridiculous gifts.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:36.700]   And there's that moment when you sit around and say, oh, let's open those now so we can
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.700]   have a good laugh.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.700]   Right.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.900]   We open those on Christmas Eve.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:44.260]   The aunt gift, the grandparent gift.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:49.420]   My mother bought, I think it was last Christmas or the Christmas before, I'm not kidding.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.060]   A pound of coffee.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:15:03.060]   And a pound of coffee and a hat, like a baseball cap with the ear muff things.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.060]   So that was very fun.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.220]   A baseball cap with ear muffins.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.220]   That's very Canadian.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.220]   That's very Canadian.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.220]   I bought one of those together.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.220]   Yeah, it's very, very Canadian.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.220]   In fact, I think it was with you, Matthew and Brian Cooper.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.220]   But I bought it.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.260]   It's a brisk, brisk commerce and ear muff baseball caps.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.340]   And in Victoria, I mean, they're actually, they're very comfortable.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.740]   Anyway, it was a lovely song.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:25.220]   The reason I bring it up, of course, is because this year more than ever, and it always is
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.860]   true every year now, people are going to be doing this stuff online.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.740]   You know, somebody suggested an Amazon wish list.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:34.420]   That would be one way to let people know what you wanted.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.460]   According to a Danny Sullivan writing into search engine land, two recent surveys suggest
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:44.340]   Google's shopping, Google's paid shopping site isn't leading searches to the best prices
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.500]   on products.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.060]   And that's no surprise because it is a paid ever.
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.060]   It's advertising.
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.900]   Advertising, which Danny's always been very mad at Google for switching this.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.420]   And I don't blame him, actually.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   But he's been outraged.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:00.180]   This is this to him and I think is the lowest thing Google's done is get rid of its legitimate
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.980]   shopping engine and put it in an advertising mechanism.
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.860]   Well, I'm not disagreeing with him necessarily.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:10.660]   Microsoft actually, that's part, big part of their scruggled is you think shopper is an
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.660]   independent search engine.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:13.300]   It's not its ads.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.500]   And I think part of what Danny's problem is that they said they wouldn't do that.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.500]   Right.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.220]   So they're specifically doing things that they used to say they would never do.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:31.540]   When you do a Google search and he shows, and by the way, according to some surveys,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.700]   the consumer watchdog said there was a $20 price gap between what was listed on Google's
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.420]   shopper and what was listed as the lowest price for the same item on price grabber or
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:46.380]   shopzilla or next tag, which are actually shopping comparison engines.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.460]   So I think Google should not have gotten out of the, I think they should have been
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.980]   an opportunity friendly thing for consumers to give real prices.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.940]   I don't think the revenue was that much on that shopping stuff.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:59.300]   Yeah, I think it was wrong to drop it.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.300]   So do a search.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.700]   He does a search here for Hamlet and Beach two slice metal toaster.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.380]   The kind of search somebody who knows what they're going to get, but wants to find the
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.700]   best price would do.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.780]   He gets, of course, the yellow box with ads in it.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.140]   Everybody knows to ignore that, although it does go quite a way down the page.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:18.420]   Then he gets this sponsored box from Google shopper.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.940]   And these are all paid ads.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:26.420]   Only people who pay Sears, Kmart, Jay Zpenny, Walmart, only the people who pay are going
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.420]   to get on there.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.380]   So if you're going to get a new price, you might, because you've seen the dollar amount,
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.420]   you might reasonably say, we've seen boxes like this on Amazon and elsewhere, that these
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.620]   are the best prices.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.940]   Google does not show the prices in the regular search.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:48.220]   So I think it's not unreasonable to think that these are the best prices.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.580]   It is what you would expect.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.260]   So I think there is an opportunity, right?
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.260]   And of course, if you click it, you get pulled to the Google shopper site, which again is
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.740]   just advertising.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:09.820]   Yeah, maybe go to Amazon or price, you know, next tag or one of these other price grabber,
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.860]   one of these other sites.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.700]   I saw a story today, I think in the times where I see it, Keith Kelly has come out with
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:22.020]   his new tools piece, basically a print blog.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.020]   Kevin Kelly.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.020]   Kevin Kelly.
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.020]   Sorry, Kevin Kelly.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   The tools is so good.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.020]   Cool.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.020]   Cool.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.020]   So now he has a print product.
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.100]   He's a print product based on that.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.100]   I have it.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.100]   It's awesome.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.780]   And the QR code takes you straight to Amazon.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:39.060]   And I presume he's getting a spiff on every sale made that way.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060]   I would.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   I don't know.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.060]   I hope he does.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.060]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.060]   That book.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.740]   We're going to have Kevin on a, let's talk about it.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.500]   Mark Fronfelder, I think helped him on it.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.300]   It is the, it is the whole catalog.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.500]   That's exactly the point.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   It was the back.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500]   It was the top from it.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.500]   Really?
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.900]   Yeah, but I, you know, they have QR codes in there, but you know, I did probably what
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:04.340]   most normal people are going to do, which is a main a note, oh, Wirly Pop went to Amazon,
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.700]   got the price and bought it.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.860]   Although I have to say I do not do price comparison.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:11.020]   I just figure Amazon is going to be the best price.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.940]   And it does have free shipping.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940]   And free shipping.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.940]   Mm.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.580]   And soon it'll be a drone coming to your door and then happy.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.460]   He resist that.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:21.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.460]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.820]   So the chat room is telling me that according to TechCrunch confirming it from multiple sources,
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.340]   Instagram, which is having a bit of a show tomorrow, we thought it was going to be all
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.660]   about printing, will be surprising people.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:39.140]   It isn't just about printing.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.540]   Instagram is launching a messaging service this year.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.780]   Actually, Om wrote about that, had a bit of a scoop saying that that was coming.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   He knew.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.780]   A couple days ago, right?
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.100]   Messaging is huge.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:58.580]   You look at what was the amount of traffic WhatsApp handles.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.340]   And this isn't a very competitive field too.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.140]   I mean, there's dozens of these guys.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:05.140]   So it's a very powerful stuff.
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:12.540]   And of course, Google Hangouts and Apple's messages are doing this using SMS on your
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.620]   phone in addition to the internet one.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:21.740]   In fact, I just got prompted by Google to swap out my messaging app for Hangout.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:25.460]   I've done that on my phones and I don't know if I hate it.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.460]   I don't like it.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.460]   Why?
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:31.660]   It's a heavy weight and SMS was lightweight.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.700]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.460]   There's just too much.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.380]   You UI, it's hard to get back to the messages.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.460]   It's just it's not cramming too much in together.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.460]   Listen, I like Hangouts.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.980]   I use Hangouts to Leo's consternation.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:47.260]   I use Hangouts, but they're trying to throw in too many kitchen sinks into it.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.260]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   There's too much in one.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.220]   SMS was so simple.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.220]   Yep.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.100]   I'm really, you know, I have the hang, you know, in the dock on my Android phone, I have
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.940]   phone and then used to have messages, you know, SMS and now I have Hangouts.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.260]   But I think I'm going to go back to messages.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:06.300]   They actually kind of screwed up the phone thing too.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.300]   I don't know about you, but on my Nexus, the whole display of the phone.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.260]   I know it's the same thing.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:15.260]   When you pull it up, it's now so confusing.
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.340]   I can't tell.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   So I tap on people and accidentally call them, but I really just wanted to look at their
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.340]   information.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.340]   Yes.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.340]   So they need to do some work there.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.980]   They made a big deal about, oh, the new phone UI and KitKat.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:28.980]   It's so great.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   It's so great.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.740]   No, they're putting too much stuff in there.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.740]   This is we need just we want to simplicity.
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.740]   Simplicity.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.380]   Well, and of course that used to be Google's big thing, right?
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.940]   We just have a bar, a box, right?
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.500]   Simplicity was the whole deal.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.460]   And now I wish they could get a little bit of that back.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.220]   This is the entropy of technology.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:50.500]   The entropy of technology is complexity.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.340]   It's feature creep.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.780]   And there's nothing anybody can do about it.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.780]   It's a law of nature.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:59.980]   Well, and the only people who can prevent that are guys like Steve Jobs who basically
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:05.580]   has people killed when they have new features.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.820]   Because designers and developers would just add this little thing because five people
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.620]   might think it's cool or because we think it's cool.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.620]   It's not just technology.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:17.180]   When I started at a weekly, they were basically done with the design six weeks before.
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.300]   And then the designers kept futzing and I didn't know enough to stop them.
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.620]   They futzed and futzed and made it awful.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:25.780]   Look at car designs.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   They get over futzed.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.940]   futzines are real danger in design.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.940]   Yeah, futz.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.700]   No more futzing.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:32.700]   Stop futzing.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.860]   That's why you need a Steve Jobs who really wasn't a designer.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.860]   He was a...
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.860]   Nobody...
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.580]   He knew the most important principle, which is it's what you take out.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   Right.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.980]   What you don't include that has a huge impact on the usability.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   Yes.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.820]   Yes, we need another Steve.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:53.380]   So Om Alex scooped him November 22nd on Gigalom.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.700]   He said, "What's Instagram's next big thing?
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.780]   Messaging perhaps TechCrunch is saying now more sources confirming that."
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:01.500]   That's an example of feature creams.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.100]   Instagram did the same damn thing.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.660]   They started with a very simple clean, you post pictures and then it became videos.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.900]   Now it's going to be messaging.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.900]   This is not good.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.300]   Well, and that's, you know, it's Facebook.
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300]   Right.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]   Right.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.300]   That's the Facebook.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.300]   The king of futzing.
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.580]   They bought it was because it was part of this huge wave that they want to be part of.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.340]   And so they're trying to write it.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.340]   You know, they've tried their own messaging.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:32.500]   How many times now they've tried to do that kind of WhatsApp or to get their messenger
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:38.940]   app to be used by more people and people just won't do it.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.260]   Gene Munster.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.260]   Who depending on who...
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.780]   Who's the on that show?
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:52.980]   Yeah, Ed Munster, Herman Munster, Gene Munster of Piper Jeffrais, an analyst and Apple
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:53.980]   Guys.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.580]   He does a lot of Apple stuff and Apple Guys just, you know, mock him, frankly.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.300]   But he does do something which I think is quite good.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.260]   And I think he's attempting to be very objective and serious.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:10.340]   He does a annual comparison of Google now versus Siri, Google Voice Search versus Siri.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.060]   And they do this pretty rigorously.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:18.860]   800 queries under a variety of controlled and uncontrolled conditions.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:23.300]   He gave Google a C plus which is better than the D minus it got a year ago.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:28.180]   And Siri, a C plus up slightly from the C last year.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:35.380]   And it's based on, you know, ability to answer questions to correct when correctly heard,
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:39.180]   whether it was correct or incorrect when correctly heard, heard correctly, heard incorrectly,
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.300]   in a variety of environments.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.500]   And you know, really if you look at the numbers, they are very similar.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500]   I get so frustrated.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.420]   I mean, you know, this is, this is, I should complain.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.780]   You can talk to your phone and it does things for you.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.860]   If it's right half the time, that's pretty amazing.
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.540]   But when it's wrong, there's no way for me to correct it, no way for a word.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.300]   That's what, you know, can I just spell the word for you, you idiot?
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:11.020]   Well, and in normal as a speech to text like drag and dictate, you do have that capability.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.020]   Right.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:15.140]   So I don't know why they put it here because it's, you know, I have a restaurant, I go
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:19.940]   to often go to urban table and it'll get, you know, 25 variations on it.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:21.460]   And I, you know, shot it.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.460]   It's in my phone book.
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460]   Words are there.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.460]   Right.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.380]   There are just certain things that you know you can't dictate.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:34.780]   That's one of my, that's one of my sort of series about speech recognition and actually
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:42.140]   other things that are computer aided, even if they're 98% accurate, that 2% is so irritating
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:47.940]   that that's all you think about is the irritating part, not the 98% where exactly right.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:52.580]   That's exactly how I measure the quality of those old style text to speech.
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:58.780]   I'm sorry, speech to text systems like drag and dictate is how, what percentage is correct.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:03.580]   And it usually is, you know, 95, 98% and more importantly, how easy it is to fix it if it's
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.580]   wrong.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.980]   Because you're going to spend, if you spend 2% of the time fixing it, it's got to be easy
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.380]   so it doesn't get in your way.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.580]   But was that you can't be quickly realistic telemarketing robots?
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.940]   This is, this is related.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.940]   This is crazy.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.580]   Let me just play it.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.780]   There's, there's two and you almost have to have to listen to both of these.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.780]   These are from telemarketing.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.780]   So this is over the phone.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.780]   Hello.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.780]   How are you today?
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.780]   Okay.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.780]   How are you?
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.780]   Good.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.780]   Well, I'm calling about an online.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.780]   She's, she's the robot.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.780]   I wasn't sure.
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:40.780]   We were all major companies and compare all the rates for you.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.180]   I can get you a quote in about five minutes.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.180]   Okay.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.380]   Are you a robot?
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.880]   I am a real person.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.880]   Can you hear me?
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   Okay.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.380]   I can hear you just fine, but you sound like a robot.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.180]   I understand.
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.580]   So, so that one's interesting.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.380]   A lot of pause is kind of a giveaway.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.380]   I do it.
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.380]   How are you?
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.380]   Here's the second one.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.180]   I'm calling about an online request you once made about health insurance coverage.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.180]   Okay.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.980]   With all major companies and compare.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.780]   Hey, are you a robot?
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.780]   What?
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:16.540]   No, I am a real person.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:17.540]   I am a real person.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.300]   I'm sorry about that.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.300]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.380]   So you just sound so much like a robot.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.940]   I am a real person.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940]   Maybe we have a bad story.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.660]   I'm sorry about that.
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.180]   Will you tell me you're not a robot?
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.180]   Just say I'm not a robot, please.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.780]   I am a real person.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.380]   I mean, I believe you, but will you just say I'm not a robot?
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:42.300]   It'll make me feel better to hear you say it.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.340]   There is a live person here.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:47.340]   But I know there is.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:52.300]   It will just make me feel so much better to hear you say I am not a robot.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.300]   So, right.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:28:00.020]   If you could say the words I'm not a robot, it would really mean a lot to me.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.500]   I am a real person.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.500]   Can you hear me okay?
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.500]   Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500]   So that we've heard now all the candidates.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500]   You guys are not a robot.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.500]   They're repeating it.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.500]   Yes, I'm a real person.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.940]   Right, but when you say I'm not a robot?
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:16.100]   Why do I feel like this is in our future?
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.860]   This is going to be in 10 years my life.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:24.940]   This is like the great Howard Stern shtick where Richard and Sal will take ridiculous
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.580]   pieces of audio and call somebody with them.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:32.460]   They'll have a name.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.020]   And they're still on its way.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.020]   They use the soundboard.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.220]   They can keep going for five minutes.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:42.740]   They used to do it with a clip from True Lies of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740]   I'm not a machine.
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:47.740]   Who is your daddy?
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.740]   Who's your daddy?
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   Exactly.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740]   I am not a robot.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740]   I wonder what that's going to be.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   I'm not a robot.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.740]   I wonder what that's going to be.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.740]   I can imagine Sal and Richard are just typing away things and calling it 100 numbers.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.740]   Well, I think that's a human voice recorded.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:08.740]   There is a significant amount of recognition going on because obviously recognize the word
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.740]   robot.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.740]   How they also got her to do the laugh and the laugh.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:12.740]   Yeah, the laugh.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:13.740]   Charmin laugh.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.740]   Yeah, well, they have a script.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.740]   She comes in.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.740]   She's a real person.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   She reads the script.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:18.740]   But I often say no.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:19.740]   It says laugh and say no.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.740]   No.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.740]   I'm not a real person.
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.980]   I'm a robot.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.740]   Not like most of the robot voices where the pitch changes.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.740]   Right.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.740]   One, two, three, four, five.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:35.740]   You have not.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.940]   That's because we've gotten better at this.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.740]   It's not that hard.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:43.740]   Well, and it's getting, I mean, that's pretty close.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.300]   Who's your daddy?
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.460]   What does he do?
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:50.460]   Exactly.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.100]   Now, wouldn't it be interesting if we learned that the Amazon made a gal is a robot?
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:56.940]   I was just thinking of that.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:57.940]   Mm.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.940]   Mm.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.980]   No wonder she didn't mind when the guy hit on her.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   What was her little.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   the Nexus TV.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:17.180]   This comes from the information Jessica lessons do pay wall blog, which I paid for.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:21.660]   Although now that I think about it, isn't such a deal, it costs about the same as a Wall
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.260]   Street Journal and gives you maybe an article or two a day.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.040]   Nevertheless, they've got really good people.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:30.780]   She brought Amir and Friday, who has excellent contacts at Google over from the Journal.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:35.300]   Of course, Jessica lessons has been a really good astute reporter on the Apple folk.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.620]   To me, it's worth it.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:42.380]   But because I bought it, I can now show you the whole article, which I probably shouldn't
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.380]   do.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.380]   Actually asked Jessica, she was on Twitter.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380]   She said, no, no, that's fine.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.380]   We expect people to do that.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.260]   When somebody, a business insider, somebody say, we're going to publish every single article.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.780]   Yeah, a business insider said, if they got anything good, it was fascinating.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.500]   Nick Carlson said, I think Jessica and the information are going to work out pretty well.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:03.100]   And he said, if she gets this many subscribers, she can turn it into a pretty good business.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.260]   But if she gets anything good, we're going to tell you all about it.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.820]   So don't bother subscribing.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.980]   She actually interviewed her and wrote a post about it.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.060]   And she said the same thing.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:17.220]   She actually expects and she's hoping that sites will do that because that's going to
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.220]   help market the site.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.540]   And presumably, if you're a subscriber, you'll get it quicker and sooner.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:26.420]   And she's smart enough to say, I'm going to target people, just as the Wall Street Journal
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:29.180]   does, for whom this information is money.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.180]   Right.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.340]   That's the only person who's going to pay 400 bucks for it.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:36.460]   And so for those people, having it right away instead of waiting for Nick Carlson to
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:40.500]   just synopsize it or determine what's important will make a difference.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.700]   And she does have very good people.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.700]   It's interesting.
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.860]   I'm not a fan of the paywall.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:49.740]   But I do think that the journal has succeeded and she may very well succeed because of the
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.740]   audience.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:55.900]   Yeah, I think there's a high end possibility, but it puts the requirement on her to work
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:01.020]   really hard because in the tech blog world, so much of the junk is just repeated over
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.660]   and over and over again.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:08.140]   And we can along the way, it's over covered.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:11.540]   But isn't that, I mean, wouldn't she say that's the opportunity for her?
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.820]   She's going to have unique stuff.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.820]   She'll be the first.
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:20.620]   Yes, that'll be repeated again and again in, you know, telephone fashion.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.700]   Let's be honest.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.580]   At some point, it's about leaks, right?
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.580]   Michael, there are resources.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:26.580]   It's about sources.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.220]   Yeah, and sources of leaks.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.980]   And what's the interest of the leaker, which is often a official company person putting
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.380]   a trial balloon up.
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:37.060]   What's their interest in putting it on the information versus putting it on?
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.060]   Get going.
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.060]   That's interesting.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.060]   That's a good point.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:45.500]   If they want specific readers, then the information might be worthwhile.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.940]   But if they want broad sort of readership, that might not be.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:50.940]   Right.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:57.580]   And, you know, I'm sure Amir and Jessica have the context because they were at the journal.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:03.420]   The question is whether those people will continue to feed them information at the information.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.260]   We want to do that.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:10.780]   I'm really tired of this network being just an echo chamber for I want to have.
[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:12.140]   I want to read what the Verge said.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.700]   I want the Verge to read what we said.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:18.300]   And that requires spending some money hiring people with connections.
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.300]   It's that's it's challenging.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:23.060]   Is that is that some of your plan for the new numbers?
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.060]   It is.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:25.140]   I think that that's what we need to do.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.300]   We need to be.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.340]   We need to have people working for us who have contacts who can get the story.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:37.860]   And it's I don't know if we're going to be able to do it, but I think that's the way that's
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.860]   what we need.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860]   That's what we need to do.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   We you know, we've got the analysis side down.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.860]   Great.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:46.980]   I mean, I think we have really smart people Matthew and Jeff and Steve and Paul and Mary
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:52.300]   Joe and all we got great people, authoritative voices, John C. to work who analyze great.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.780]   We just now we need for some reporters to be quoted.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.860]   How does that work out in the timing of video?
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.180]   So if if something breaks, well, I've got a stupid law.
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:03.580]   We'll do it at 11 o'clock.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.580]   We'll do it at 11 o'clock.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:07.380]   We'll break in and then put it up as a video that gets quoted.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.460]   That's why I've hired a full-time news director.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:13.420]   Well, there's lots of journalists being laid off from lots of news.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.740]   Yeah, they are cheaper than they used to be.
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:19.540]   They are market pool.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.780]   And that's like, you know, it's still challenging because I mean, you know, this is we're making
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.500]   the transition from being a podcast, little podcasts to being a information network.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:33.540]   That's expensive, you know, to do it, especially without venture funding.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:38.940]   So one of the stories Jessica had in the information, Google's latest takeover attempt for TV,
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:43.580]   Nexus TV, Google's tried, of course, with Google TV and they've got the Chromecast, but
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:48.660]   the Nexus TV would be a set top box.
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:52.460]   Amira Friday actually writing the story in the information.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.380]   What's the difference between that and Chromecast?
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:56.580]   Well, that's not a set top box.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:03.100]   It's more like a Google TV, which is a set top box.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:06.300]   It's powered by Android.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:11.340]   It has been designed to both be a television, you know, thing and a video game console for
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:12.780]   playing Android apps.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.260]   So think, we are.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.900]   Might come with a separate touchpad remote control.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.900]   The box, which doesn't carry live TV like a cable box does, maybe controlled through a
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.180]   smartphone or tablet.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:29.660]   This does sound a little bit like a like a high end Chromecast and will be aggressively
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:30.660]   priced.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:35.540]   This is a tough business.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.780]   I mentioned the numbers.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:43.660]   The number one product, the Apple TV, I'm sorry, I said 31 million, 13 million.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:44.660]   I pull this.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:45.660]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.500]   I reversed the numbers, 8 million for the Roku.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:53.180]   The total for all of them is well under 30.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:56.420]   So no wonder Apple calls that a hobby.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:57.420]   Mm hmm.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:59.580]   Yeah, I got the numbers reversed.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.580]   I apologize.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:05.620]   Yeah, 13 million is not like anything to go right home about.
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.780]   Did you guys read the Vanity Fair article about Merci Meyer?
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:09.780]   I didn't.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.620]   No, I skimmed it.
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620]   Is it a hit piece?
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.940]   That's what some said.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:18.300]   I don't think it's a well, I wouldn't say it's a hit piece.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.460]   I mean, it's not a sort of fawning.
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:25.340]   You know, she's the best thing that ever happened to a company piece.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:31.300]   That's critical in some spots, particularly of her sort of personality.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.700]   They call her arrogant and furious.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:35.700]   Cold.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.700]   Cold.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:37.700]   Mm hmm.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.860]   And yes, others say best CEO I've ever worked for.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:46.380]   And a lot of that is, and the argument's made before, I think it's true with sexist, that
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:49.220]   there are things said about her that wouldn't be said about men.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:56.540]   You know, if a CEO, a male CEO is tough, cold and furious.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.260]   She has to be tougher.
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.260]   Right.
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.260]   She has to be.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.460]   But if a man was as tough as she was, nobody would say they would say he's good.
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:05.460]   He's aggressive.
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:06.460]   He's a tough CEO.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:07.460]   That'd be good.
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:13.900]   It's all about how she she makes people wait, you know, outside her office for appointment.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.700]   Well, okay.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:16.700]   Yes, why?
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:17.700]   Who's that boss?
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.700]   I mean, you think Andy Grove didn't do that.
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.020]   Paul Avilini didn't do that.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:22.420]   Larry Page doesn't do that.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:28.540]   There's no cookies and milk and she doesn't give you a happy face on your, you know,
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:30.980]   and your performance report.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.160]   Could she just please put a circle above her eyes?
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   Just a little circle dot.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.980]   Maybe a heart once in a while.
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.980]   She interrupts people.
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.380]   Oh, so I got a question pretty late.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.540]   What were Katie Kurex, producer on Yahoo?
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:49.820]   What would you make news on Yahoo?
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:54.580]   The problem is Katie Kurek has for years been pigeonholed in the soft feature news thing,
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:55.580]   right?
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:56.980]   She's done some hard news.
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:58.180]   Well, she was the anchor.
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180]   She was the anchor.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.180]   CBCB News.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   Sure she has.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   But you know why they made her anchor to soften the news.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.180]   Well, okay.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   I don't know.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.380]   You don't come from the Today Show and it'd be seen as a hard hitting journalist.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.380]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.380]   So I don't know.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.620]   What she's done most recently is a daytime Gabfest.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:18.620]   Does it make sense to you, making her some sort of global anchor for Yahoo?
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.620]   Does that make sense to you?
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.100]   Well, she's in name and she's probably the best name they could get.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.780]   But what's she going to do?
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.500]   That's what Jeff's saying.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:30.980]   What do you do with Katie Kurek coming in the morning and you do a lot.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.980]   Let's treat this.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:38.660]   You know, as I said earlier today, I want to reinvent TV news because it needs reinventing.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.820]   And I was asked by weekend edition to come along and talk about Katie Kurek.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.300]   So I decided to make it into my own agenda.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.780]   My own agenda was I hope.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:46.260]   Brissa is very smart.
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.180]   Katie's smart.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:51.380]   They can break away from the stupid conventions of TV.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:53.900]   They can reinvent what TV news is.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.340]   So I still want to come back to the idea of what should it be?
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.340]   What could it be?
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.020]   Let's help them out.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:05.940]   Well, I think part of the problem is, and this is a really difficult one to solve, that
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.300]   is still the person up on a stage.
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.300]   Pedestral?
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.300]   Addressing the crowd.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.300]   Agreed.
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:16.340]   And I don't think that's what the Internet ear wants or needs.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:17.740]   I think they want a conversation.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.380]   So they're watching the stream.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   One thing.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   The morning stream?
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:23.180]   Did you watch the stream on Al Jazeera?
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.180]   No, I haven't.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:31.300]   I haven't watched it in a while, but I was on a few times and it was, it was trying to
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:37.540]   do a show informed by social media, informed by the audience with bringing in members of
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.540]   the audience.
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:46.220]   Ahmed Shehad, Eldin, I'm going to get his name wrong, but he's with Huffington Post
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.220]   live now.
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:54.380]   He was a co-host and they would bring in people who'd been commenting about a story as well
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   as news clips.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:01.740]   So we're trying to turn it into more of a social thing, which a lot of media and information
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:10.100]   is now, instead of just, here's a clip with our guy standing in front of a building downtown.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:11.100]   Right.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.100]   Right.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.180]   And you see the same thing with CNN.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:18.820]   You saw, you know, Shepard Smith with his big ass tables.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.460]   You know, the whole idea is let's get the Twitter feed involved.
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:25.300]   I think we've got to cut down to the fundamentals of what video can do.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.460]   Well, this is why I raise you.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.060]   One thing that it can do is explain.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:33.540]   Another thing it can do is it can summarize.
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:43.140]   You know, what are the key attributes and advantages that video, whether it's broadcast
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:48.140]   on the internet or broadcast on the airwaves, what are the attributes of that that one could
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.220]   capture and rethink rather than the stupid conventions of standing in front of the building
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:55.140]   that burned down 12 hours ago and when things happened?
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:41:00.220]   But that's the hard part is that a lot of stories, particularly some important stories,
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.220]   there aren't any visuals.
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:02.220]   Right.
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:03.980]   There's just a little stuff about it.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:04.980]   No, exactly.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980]   And that doesn't stop this.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:06.980]   Look at this.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.460]   It's just a bunch of guys talking about stuff.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:09.460]   That's true.
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:10.460]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:12.740]   I think that's what Katie Couric should do.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:15.740]   She should have conversations on that.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:18.260]   Maybe it isn't bringing in the Twitter, the Twitter, Ravi.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.740]   Maybe it's, maybe it's, it's having conversations with, with people in New Nelson Mandela or something,
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.260]   but that's what should be conversation.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.260]   It shouldn't be, I think it's a thing.
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:31.900]   And actually, Huffington Post Live does a good job with their, they use Google Hangouts.
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.140]   They'll have five or six people.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:36.620]   They're all, you know, in the Hangout.
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:42.020]   Admittedly, the technical quality is not great, but they at least bring in lots of voices
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.020]   instead of just...
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:44.300]   Yeah, I want to do more with that, actually.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.940]   The one person academic, they can fly into the studio.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:48.940]   Right.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:49.940]   It's challenging.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:50.940]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:51.940]   Believe me, if I did, I'd be doing it.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.380]   Somebody in the chat room, by the way, says, and I, this is, I didn't know this.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:00.740]   Katie Couric's, it's RSX 11M in our chat room, says, "On the day of 9/11, Katie Couric's coverage
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:03.260]   was the best of all the mainstream media channels."
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.460]   Katie's very smart.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:09.380]   Yeah, I'm not, in fact, this is not a reflection on her.
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:14.060]   And as he points out, or she points out, it could be the, it was the way she was managed.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:19.020]   It was, it could be the way the executive saw her as opposed to what her capabilities
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.020]   were.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:23.660]   I just don't understand what, yeah, who is going to do.
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.660]   That's difficult.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:25.660]   You know, and Jeff, your point is a good one.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.820]   They need to reinvent the format somehow.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820]   That's the opportunity.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:32.660]   The worst thing that could happen, newspapers have been trying to mimic TV.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.660]   Right.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:37.300]   Let's have somebody sit there in front and tell you a story and go to video a lot.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.900]   And yeah, and as scripts just bought a company called Newsy that does that, that tries to
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:43.900]   mimic television.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:44.900]   I hate that.
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:45.900]   Let's stop.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.900]   That, there's nothing to mimic there.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:47.900]   It's crap.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:51.940]   But we are, I mean, this is very much a TV meme, a TV trope.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.940]   Yes.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:59.100]   We've got cameras, you know, angles, voices, a table.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.060]   You added them on as they were valuable.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.900]   If you go back to the cottage, we didn't, well, we didn't have a table yet.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:05.900]   Right.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:06.900]   You didn't have a lot of that.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:09.420]   And so then you added them on as you felt they added value.
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:14.980]   And I'm fine with that, but doing them because big TV does them is not the reason to do them.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.980]   Call of grams.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:20.980]   That's the future.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:21.980]   Who do you ask?
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.980]   Do you ask the internet native, right?
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.980]   What do they want?
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.980]   What do they do right now?
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.220]   They watch YouTube, but that's because they're so young.
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:29.300]   I had Tim Poole, you know, Tim Poole.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.700]   Tim's the guy who, who livestreamed, walking by Wall Street for 21 hours straight and,
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.460]   and vice very incredibly hired him.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:39.740]   So I had him in my office and I had him a class in my office and I sat around and I
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:40.740]   said, you know, what's the future TV?
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.260]   I'm asking people this now.
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:46.540]   And his response was not to rethink the video screen.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:49.180]   He thought what was around the video screen.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:54.220]   He thought about the interactions of people about topics and, and, and a bunch of video
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.020]   stories of people who are witnesses to something and then some structure where you kind of
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.780]   kind of pull up the best or what's important into it.
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:04.740]   So, so he didn't think the video was this isolated thing, this window you look through
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:09.420]   that instead it was something that added to the notion of what we see on the web.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.260]   And that's what, that's exactly what the stream was trying to do.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:17.580]   Pulling in YouTube videos, pulling in eyewitness photos, pulling, it wasn't just Twitter chatter.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:24.420]   It was actual, it was trying to in real time, you know, sort of crowdsource the news instead
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:29.620]   of just picking one talking head and talking to them for 15 minutes and then going to commercial.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:30.620]   Can we even watch it anymore?
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.180]   Or is it on Al Jazeera English?
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.140]   It's on at 730 Eastern.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.580]   And I, as I say, I haven't watched it in a little while, but I thought they really did
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:42.060]   some interesting things and it was much more open.
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:47.180]   You know, one of the criticisms of TV news is that it's just, it's the same talking heads
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.340]   and it's the same format and it's the same questions and you get virtually zero out of
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:52.340]   it.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:54.300]   Well, here's the other thing about it too.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.300]   It's the same plastic voice.
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:45:01.060]   You know, what I love about the Prit Network is that like, like a, like a man, I am what
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.060]   you're seeing.
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:04.260]   This is exactly what you got.
[01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:05.260]   I am what I am.
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:12.580]   It's not what I know on CNN and you automatically go into well, how we voice, you know, and
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.860]   the thing I tell people about Leo all the time is that even though you have a radio voice,
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:18.300]   you're as nice as the radio voice.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.700]   That's really, you know, you're very sweet.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.580]   Maybe you get more angry sometimes off the air than on.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.220]   Hey, Chad, does he?
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:27.580]   But no, but I don't do it off the air.
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:32.060]   I mean, I mean, in fact, somebody, somebody tweeted me, boy, I wouldn't want to work for
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.060]   Leo LaPorte.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:36.300]   He was so mean to his employees after the show.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:37.540]   And I said, Hey, I am what I am.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.820]   That's why we want you to watch it.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:41.020]   I realized that this is a reality show.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.020]   It was real reality.
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.020]   I appreciate that.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.020]   You appreciate that.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:46.380]   You boys, maybe that's what you do.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.540]   That's what you do with Katie Kirk.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:48.540]   You break the wall.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:49.540]   Break the wall.
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:50.540]   Exactly.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.540]   Because you know what?
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.540]   I bet she's really likable.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:53.540]   Yeah, she is.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:54.540]   She is.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:55.540]   So that's what you do.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.220]   And irreverent and things you can't be when you're, when you're reading a script.
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.220]   Well, my God, Katie Kirk real?
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:02.220]   Wow.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:03.220]   What would that be like?
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:07.460]   And a problem is for somebody like Katie Kirk, who has so many years doing this.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.900]   And it's so contained.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.140]   It's very hard and scary and risky to be real.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:13.900]   What did it take for you though?
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.740]   You're on TV too.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:16.500]   You're on radio.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:21.660]   I was lucky in early in, not so early, 10 or 15 years in my radio career, I had a program
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.340]   director who said you're not genuine.
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:27.020]   And he said, go take improv classes.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.420]   I want you to break it down.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.020]   I want you to see that.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.020]   Wow.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:33.220]   And I always, I did all that.
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:37.100]   And because he, what he said is, I think, you know, and that is the advice I give to
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:44.140]   everybody who works with me here is what we're looking for is who is your real, see,
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.500]   people, people, they get on camera and they get lights on them and they get a microphone.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:51.100]   They put on a mask to this protective.
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:55.620]   So if you can get the mask off and be yourself, and then the problem is sometimes people won't
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.620]   like that first.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:01.700]   Well, I'm just going to say some of those people who have masks, they're just unpleasant
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:02.700]   people.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:03.700]   Well, that's right.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.580]   But then you're not going to be a star.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:06.580]   Sorry.
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:07.580]   You got to get a real job.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.660]   Well, it's part of going back to Stern.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.860]   It's, it's, it's better for a Klee.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:12.340]   It's ours during small penis.
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:13.340]   Right?
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:14.340]   It's his thing.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.340]   I have to be real with you.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.340]   He was genuine and it's, and it was so refreshing.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.580]   He was such a huge success because nobody on the radio was normal.
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:21.580]   Right.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:22.580]   Right.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.580]   So that's a good point.
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   And nobody's willing to talk for endlessly about boring stuff or personal stuff.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.580]   And he was.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:30.140]   And that was, that was refreshing.
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:34.100]   And I think that's where Katie Kirk, if you could make her be like Howard Stern, just,
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:35.300]   you know, let it all hang out.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.300]   Carrie, Katie.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:40.140]   And if you look at the successes of even, even people like Anderson Cooper during sort
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:44.140]   of crisis events, one of the things that I think resonates with people is when they
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.300]   respond as human beings.
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.300]   Yes.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:48.300]   Right.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.300]   Which is very rare.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:50.300]   Mm hmm.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:53.420]   But I do, but there are sure, you know, I, I, for a long time I did live with Kelly and
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.140]   Regis, though they were very genuine on the year.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.140]   A daily show does that.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:59.140]   It's very hard.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.060]   Because of her today show experience, it wouldn't be so hard to do that.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.220]   I think that's, that's what she should, there you go.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.220]   You got, we got there.
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.220]   We got to your answer.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:07.420]   Let it all hang out, Katie.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:12.340]   Well, I actually, I, I, I, I, I, I tweeted that I had done the weekend edition thing
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:16.220]   with this hope about Katie and she tweeted back really.
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:17.220]   So yeah.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.220]   So awesome.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.220]   Awesome.
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.220]   She's got some good handlers.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:21.580]   Well, I'll tell you who else I would ask.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:24.340]   And that's Alexis O'Hanyan, the creator of Reddit.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:29.100]   He's got a new book called without their permission, how the 21st century will be made, not
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:30.100]   managed.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.340]   He will be our guest in just a few minutes.
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:32.340]   Yeah, he's a regular.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.340]   He's great.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.340]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.340]   Who isn't?
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.340]   There's an example guy.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.340]   Everybody loves.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.340]   He gets sick of hearing this.
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.260]   I'm sure, but he's going to be president someday.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.660]   Oh, God, that would be good news.
[01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:44.660]   He's a politician.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:45.660]   He is.
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:46.660]   In a decent way.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.660]   He has the charm.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.660]   He's a hand shaker.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.660]   He's, and he has a great smile and all that.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:54.340]   He is the mayor of the internet.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.340]   That's true.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:56.340]   I'm the president.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:59.340]   I'm just saying I outrank him, but...
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.900]   I'm just the conscience.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:03.380]   I think more people know who he is and know who I am.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.580]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:07.860]   When we come back, we'll get our tip tool number of the week, anything else you want
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.620]   to contribute as well.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:16.100]   It's so good to have Matthew Ingram here from gigaohm.com, Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.420]   Our show today brought to you by Bill Harris.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.420]   You may know that name.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.620]   He was the CEO of PayPal, then Intuit.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:27.940]   And while he was at Intuit, I think he learned a little bit about what people want from financial
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:28.940]   software.
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:34.860]   When I, you know, I remember very well the very first program I ever typed in on my Atari
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:38.220]   800 was a checkbook balancing program.
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.060]   That was one of the number one things people wanted to do with a computer.
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:46.180]   And I had Intuit, a quick end, I guess, and I had Microsoft money.
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.620]   And I remember, you know, I get my bank statement.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.620]   I go through it and everything.
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.180]   And you don't have to do that anymore.
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:57.540]   And personal capital, which is Bill's startup really is a great example.
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.540]   Personal capital takes all your financial, you give it the information.
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:06.900]   It keeps track of all of your complex financial life.
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:13.580]   Everything that you're trying to keep track of in an easy to understand financial dashboard.
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:17.900]   The irony of it is that as your financial life progresses, the more you make, the more
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.900]   complicated it is to manage.

[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.420]   Let us see.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.100]   Normally we would have Gina Trepani.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.260]   We don't have the change log.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:35.020]   I can mention a couple of things that have changed.
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:39.700]   For instance, Harry McCracken was all excited because finally you have offline editing on
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.260]   Google spreadsheets.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.620]   Unfortunately, you have to create new spreadsheets to use it.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.660]   It won't work with the old ones.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:48.660]   That's good.
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:53.460]   Google Glass Explorer Edition owners are now getting to upgrade their eyewear.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:55.900]   I got my location so I'm now in line.
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:52:00.860]   They say straight out, you don't have to but we think you should.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:04.180]   Because you're going to get music, you're going to have stereo or at least-
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.380]   Also most for me, I found them on use.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:09.500]   I will be able to expend even more money on them.
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:14.500]   Prescription.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.500]   You have to get the prescription lenses separately?
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.500]   Oh yeah.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:21.500]   I have these ridiculous barrelics wild.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:22.500]   Very expensive.
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.500]   No, it's horrible.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:30.940]   Dell releases a 11-inch Chromebook, the first Chromebook from Dell and it's aimed specifically
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.940]   at education.
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:35.500]   They added in their own cloud thing.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.500]   Rocket cloud.
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:44.820]   The other great Chromebook that's out that is almost perfect is the Asus 720p because it's
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:47.860]   got a touchscreen but it's still two gigs.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:51.940]   Minimum for me in a Chromebook is four gigs unless the software's changed markedly.
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:55.020]   There's too many tabs and it craps out.
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:53:01.820]   I had my beloved Pixel, which I'm not using right now, but my Pixel is right next to me.
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:06.300]   It has this odd bug that came in the last few weeks where somewhere in the middle of
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:10.860]   a video we'll start making an out of phase scratchy sound.
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:14.020]   Part of the audio is a second later.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.380]   So I had a great call with support.
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.380]   Really nice guy.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:19.380]   He said, "One like Dell, we don't have any time.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:20.380]   Quotas or anything like that.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:21.380]   We chatted it through.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:23.380]   We did some stuff together.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:28.940]   Unfortunately, I had to go through a little more fixing with another guy, but then they're
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.580]   going to send me a new Chromebook Pixel.
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:31.580]   Exciting.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.580]   The Dell does have a four gig option apparently.
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:37.900]   It starts with four gig in their machine, which is good.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:43.900]   I think for those who want to buy Chromebooks, if my grandma, two gigs is fine.
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:48.260]   But if you're going to do more than a number of tabs, you want four gigs.
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:52.860]   I saw a video of somebody who had upgraded one of the Asus machines to 10 gigs and it
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:54.660]   was just smooth as hell.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:55.660]   Really?
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.740]   You can put 10 gigs in one of those things?
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:53:59.740]   One of them, yeah.
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:00.740]   Wow, holy cow.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:01.740]   That's crazy.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:02.740]   That's crazy.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:03.740]   Isn't it?
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:08.780]   But there are 12 days, 10 hours, 24 minutes and 14 seconds to Christmas.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.740]   I know that because Google's Santa Tracker is back.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:15.460]   This isn't the one where I wrote a letter to Santa and he wrote me one back.
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:16.460]   That's right.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.700]   There's no help from NORAD this year.
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:20.700]   No.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:21.700]   Unfortunately, they're...
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.100]   They're broken up.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.100]   They've broken up.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:26.540]   I guess NORAD's still going to do it Santa Tracker though, right?
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.660]   It's going to do the Bing Santa Tracker?
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.220]   Oh, please say no.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.220]   Is it?
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.220]   Yep.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.220]   NORAD got scrugled.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:39.060]   Is NORAD going to the highest bidder?
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.300]   Is that how far we've come?
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:43.300]   That's...
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.940]   You got to pay the bills?
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:48.900]   Microsoft outbid Google on the Santa Tracker.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:51.380]   Google does have a neat advent calendar, which is kind of fun.
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:54.380]   You click, you go through as you get closer and closer.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.500]   Those negotiations would have been fun with NORAD and Santa.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.500]   I want Santa.
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.340]   No, you can't have him.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.700]   Was Santa involved or...
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:03.700]   This is Claus.
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:04.700]   She does all the negotiations.
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:05.700]   She does all the negotiations.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.700]   She's much tougher than Santa.
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:08.700]   Santa's a pushover.
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.260]   Oh, I can do something here.
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:12.260]   All right.
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.260]   Apparently I should...
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:14.660]   Oh, oh, it's a candy machine.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.660]   Whoa.
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.100]   A candy cane machine.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.100]   Whoa.
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:21.340]   That's no candy crush.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:23.260]   Wow.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.820]   I guess I'll keep playing this until I get bored.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:30.140]   Jeff, do you have a number of the week?
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.460]   Kind of.
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.780]   What you mentioned before the Chromecast is Time's Top Gadget.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:41.420]   CNET has top 100 gadgets and Google has two of the five top spots with the Nexus 5
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.500]   and the Nexus 7, which I adore, fully.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.500]   That's the five is what you're using.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.940]   Five is what I'm using and loving it.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:52.620]   Sun Jake is looking to get the X, which I think I adore, so I think it's a very good...
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.620]   I love the X.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.860]   And look at the G, too.
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:55.860]   The Moto G is pretty...
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:56.860]   Pretty amazing.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:57.860]   Very expensive.
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:01.260]   Who would have thought Google would become a major hardware company?
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:02.260]   I don't know.
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.260]   I just got the X.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.260]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:05.260]   I'm surprised.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:06.260]   I love it.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.980]   Yeah, it's not exactly a high spec...
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.580]   A phone, but I just think it's really great.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:11.140]   She was an iPhone user and she...
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.140]   Wow.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.140]   ...through wrote the iPhone and now she's all Moto X.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:15.140]   Wow.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.620]   And Jake refuses to go to iOS 7.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.420]   He won't do it, so he's going to switch to...
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.820]   I don't blame him.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:20.820]   It's...
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.820]   I'm...
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.820]   I don't want to get in.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:24.660]   While we're at it, while we're talking about that, what was it here?
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:31.220]   There's a new Sony Z Ultra Pure Android Edition coming out for I think
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.220]   $650.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:33.220]   That's a...
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.740]   It's six and a half inch, I think, or six inch phone.
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:38.740]   Oh, that's very nice.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:39.740]   That's nice.
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:47.580]   A white Nexus 7 is out and a play edition of the LG GPad 8.3.
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.380]   So while we're on Google Gadgets.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:51.180]   I don't think you can solve this one.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.180]   Chad, I need some help on this one.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.780]   I'm stuck on the candy canes.
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:56.780]   This is...
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:57.780]   Oh!
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:58.780]   Oh!
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:56:59.780]   Oh!
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:00.780]   Oh!
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:01.780]   Oh!
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:02.780]   How do I solve this?
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.780]   Can you click that middle one?
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:05.780]   It's probably a lot.
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.780]   Oh!
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.780]   Because it has like a little...
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.780]   Oh, click the middle one.
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:09.780]   Because it has like a little...
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:10.780]   Hey, what's going on?
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:11.780]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.780]   That's all.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:13.780]   It's all inertia.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.780]   Oh, no!
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:15.780]   Oh, no, no, no!
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:16.780]   Okay.
[01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:21.780]   I admit it gets a little harder.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:22.780]   Gamecheats.com.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:25.780]   Yeah, it's probably Gamecheats.com would have all of this.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:26.780]   That was a video of how to do it.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:27.780]   Is it really?
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.780]   No, I'm just...
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:29.780]   Oh, you can do that.
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:31.780]   No, there'll be a video of how to do it.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.780]   Oh, book the other way.
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:33.780]   Go the other way.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.780]   No, no, no, no.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:35.780]   You can't.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.780]   There you go.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780]   You're listening on audio.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:38.780]   All right, go back.
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.780]   This is nearly as compelling as it sounds.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:45.780]   Number nine.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:46.780]   Did you have a number?
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:47.780]   I forgot.
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.780]   I already did.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.780]   Okay.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.780]   It was busy.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:52.780]   I wasn't paying attention.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.780]   I could fess.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:58.780]   Matthew Ingram, any tip or tool you'd like to mention before we wrap this sucker up?
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:03.780]   I don't have any tips or tools, but this is going to be some kind of funny.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.780]   Matthew, you came up with the last minute to rescue us and we're glad.
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:06.780]   Yeah, that was a big one.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:07.780]   Yeah.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:10.780]   But I do have one thing that I wanted to mention that I wrote about.
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.780]   This is going to seem weird because it's not a tip or a tool.
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:14.780]   It doesn't involve you at all.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.780]   Something you wrote about counts.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:21.780]   It involves Twitter, but it's shepherd.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:27.780]   So a sheep farmer in the lake district in Britain has a Twitter account that you should follow
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.780]   because it's awesome.
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:32.780]   It doesn't sound like the kind of thing you would want to follow.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.780]   What is the account?
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.780]   It's herd shephard1.
[01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:37.780]   H-E-R-D-Y.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.780]   S-H-E-P-H-E-R-D.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.780]   And the number one?
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:43.780]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:44.780]   Okay.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:46.780]   And it's an anonymous account, so you don't know who it is.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:53.780]   He wrote a great post about how he was hugely skeptical of Twitter because he's kind of a
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   funny guy.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:03.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:06.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:09.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:12.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:15.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:24.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:27.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:30.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:36.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:45.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:50.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:53.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:56.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:59.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:02.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:05.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:08.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:11.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:16.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:28.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:37.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:42.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:45.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:51.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:54.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:00.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:03.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:09.780]   And he's a really good guy.

[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:20.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:23.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:29.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:35.780]   And he's a really good guy.

[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:47.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:49.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:51.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:53.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:55.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:57.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:59.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:03.780]   And he's a really good guy.
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:08.780]   And the idea was you would send you a sexed every once in a while.
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.780]   I'm waiting.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:13.780]   I don't know if it was a hoax or not.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:15.780]   That doesn't sound official.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.780]   I'm just reaching here.
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:27.780]   Magic Pics was kind of weird because it just randomly tweeted weird photos.
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:29.780]   And it wasn't clear why.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.780]   Right.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:31.780]   It's the e-horse book.
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:33.780]   But is that one from Twitter?
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:35.780]   Because I know Magic Rex is from Twitter.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.780]   Magic Pics is not.
[02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:39.780]   Yeah, see, that's what you...
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.780]   And then they have a problem.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:43.780]   Every magic, it's or that, people are going to think it's official.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:47.780]   Twitter has also event parrot, which is an official Twitter experiment.
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:49.780]   That gives you breaking news.
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.780]   Which is odd in a way because it doesn't...
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:53.780]   Some things don't come up that you think would.
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:55.780]   Yeah, right.
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:57.780]   And then you get alerts about other things that are...
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.780]   So they might be tweaking the algorithm.
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.780]   Of a news truck.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:03.780]   I just went on a screen.
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:04.780]   It's here, dude.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:05.780]   It's great.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:09.780]   Plus, and there he is reporting the news that there is an air-conditioning cooling system fail on the space station.
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:10.780]   Oh.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:11.780]   That's what I thought about.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.780]   It was like Elgin.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   Yeah, Mike is going to take over our news operation at the beginning of the year.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:22.780]   And that's one of the steps we're taking to start getting some original news.
[02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:24.780]   Yeah, you know of him, eh?
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:25.780]   Mm-hmm.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.780]   Yeah, no, I've followed him for a while.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.780]   He's got a huge Google+ following, doesn't he?
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:30.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:32.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:33.780]   But he was...
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:35.780]   You know, his former editor-in-chief of...
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.780]   I don't want to say the wrong magazine.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.780]   One of the PC magazines.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:40.780]   Oh, magazine.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.780]   A PC magazine.
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:43.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.780]   And he's been around... I've known him for years.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:46.780]   But he...
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.780]   But what I like about him is he's another guy who's embraced new media.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.780]   He abandoned his blog for Google+.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:52.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.780]   And I think that's exciting.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.780]   I think it was... was it...
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:58.780]   I don't remember the name of the magazine.
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:03:59.780]   I apologize.
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:03.780]   Mike will actually be joining us right after a triangulation for an especially inside Twitter.
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:04.780]   We're going to introduce him.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:06.780]   Hey, I want to thank you guys for being here.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.780]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:08.780]   Thanks for having me.
[02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:09.780]   City University of New York.
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.780]   Oh, good.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:11.780]   Matthew Ingram.
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:12.780]   Chad, what up?
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:13.780]   Giga Home.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:14.780]   And Whiskers.
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.780]   My little cat friend.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.780]   You're not fooling me anymore, Chad.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   I got it now.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:23.780]   Perhaps the Shutterstock watermark gave it away.
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:24.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:27.780]   Matthew briefly mentioned holograms.
[02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:29.780]   And so I had this cat ready just in case...
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:32.780]   Hey, see, it's got Jessica yelling and we got mittens.
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:33.780]   He never brought it back up again.
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:35.780]   That was really sad.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:37.780]   So I wanted to throw it in right at the end.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.780]   Pretty damn cool.
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:39.780]   How it really looks like it's on the table.
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.780]   I knew what to work the cat.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:41.780]   That's got to be complicated.
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:42.780]   It's not easy.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.780]   I'll show you how.
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:44.780]   It's been...
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:45.780]   There you go.
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.780]   Oh, okay.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:48.780]   Thought it was actually tattooed on the cat.
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:49.780]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:51.780]   That would take you to do it.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.780]   PC World.
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:53.780]   Thank you.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:54.780]   That was the magazine.
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.780]   He's also currently a computer world.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:57.780]   He likes the world.
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:00.780]   He'll be on this show next week, we think.
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:01.780]   Right.
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:02.780]   Join us next week.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.780]   We're going to get him on Twitter as well this weekend.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:07.780]   We're trying to introduce him to our audience all around.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.780]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:10.780]   Thank you, Matthew.
[02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:11.780]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:15.780]   We do this week in Google 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time on Wednesdays.
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.780]   That's 1900.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:17.780]   No, I'm sorry.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.780]   2100 UTC on Twitter.tv.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.780]   If you want to join us live.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:22.780]   I love it.
