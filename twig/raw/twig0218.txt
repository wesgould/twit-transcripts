[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   publicness, privacy, and any topic really related to that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm Gina Trapani, and I'm filling in for Leo, who's taking a much-deserved
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   vacation, but fear not. He'll be back next week, back into the big chair.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Actually, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who's our usually my co-host,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   isn't here either today. He could make it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So the reason why I'm not freaking out, though, too badly is because I've got
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   amazing panel here. In studio, we've got Mr. Aaron Newcomb,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   host of Floss Weekly here on the TWIT Network.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Hey, Gina.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Hey, thank you so much for being here today and holding down the fort in Petaluma
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   with Chad.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, you bet anytime.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Yeah, appreciate that. You're a frequent guest and co-host on all about Android
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and TWIG, and it's very comforting to have someone I know well in the chair
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   there on the table, so thank you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You bet anytime.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And on Skype, we've got our fantastic guest today, Mike Elgin.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Hello, Gina. I know that Jeff is not here today, so I will try to complain
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   about Verizon as much as I can in the existence.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Please do.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Please do. We need that. We need that.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Mike is a freelance tech writer, Google+ user extraordinaire,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and just generally great guy. Love to talk tech with both of you.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Thank you so much, both for being here.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I guess we should just dive right down into it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I think a big story this week is that Google turned 15, 15 years old,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   which for an internet company is absolutely ancient.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yes.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They held an oppressive event at the original garage where the company started,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   which I guess they celebrate the birthday on the 27th of September,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   but that day is kind of shifted around.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's not clear what day they actually filed as a corporation.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   But they held this event back in the original garage and announced a few updates
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   to search and to their page rank algorithm.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They announced hummingbird, which is their new kind of search algorithm following
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   caffeine, which I guess has been out for like a month now.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   No one's really noticed.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And to celebrate, they changed the Google Doodle and the Google homepage
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   to the original 1998 version.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And if you missed it, like I did, you can actually Google in 1998 to see what that looked like.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Well, you know, Gina, you were probably in middle school when Google came out,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   but I was actually, I actually remember it very well.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And at the time, the hot, hot search engine was Altavista,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   just was the greatest search engine ever, Altavista.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And this Google thing came out and it was a research project.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And a few, it was like you had to be such a dork and nerd to even know that Google existed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And the first, you know, this is before the IPO and stuff like that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And, you know, if I recall, the paper that the Rok engine project was actually also available
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   on the site originally.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So you could read Sergey and Larry's sort of philosophy about page rank and all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But I actually remember when, before the IPO, and I remember trying it out and it was like,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   wow, this is pretty good.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Even then.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I remember, I don't remember when I first started using Google,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   but I do remember the time when if you use Google, you were smart and savvy.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Like it was the filter that you used, you know.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I'm not even remember how I came about it.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I was just finishing college at that time.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I was not middle school, just to be clear in 1998.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I was probably using mosaic at the time.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I was out of college, but I was using Yahoo was my primary search engine at that point.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You know, Yahoo was real big.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Everything that Yahoo was doing looked great.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And then Google came out and I was like, how do you spell that again?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   You know, and by the time I got it in, in the browser and pulled it up, like I never turned back.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It was just like all Google from then on because it worked so well and it was so simple to use.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You know, interestingly, the, the, it hasn't changed too much in the way it looks.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's true.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You would, you would think, I mean, if you look at the history of other companies like AOL
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   or Yahoo or, you know, any of those companies, they've gone through major, major changes in the way they look.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But if you look at Google, they've kept it simple and they've kept it looking, even though the features
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and functionality have changed over time, they've kept the look and feel very basic, very clean.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And it's, it's simple and it's easy to use.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So I don't know.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   What do you guys think about that?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Is that, is that a good thing?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Well, they dropped the exclamation point unlike Yahoo.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So it's pretty amazing that the company never went through a major pivot.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I think that it was either Paige or Bryn who said the original idea was to make a system so that people could
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   order pizza online without kind of leaving their house and that that had somehow given way to the
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   search.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But yeah, it's pretty amazing that it's always been a white page with an input box that returned
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   documents.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   To me, the most impressive thing that they've retained is the "I'm feeling lucky" button.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   That is, that's just a goofy sort of, you know, nobody's paying attention kind of thing that
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   a geek would throw up there and just put a button, just, you know, roll the dice on your search engine.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And it's still there.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You know, it's, it's, it's a multi-gazillion dollar company and they still offer, "I'm feeling
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   lucky."
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think there's something to be, I think there's something to be said for that.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I mean, it speaks to their initial bravado, if you will.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You know, they had done so much testing and they say, "Look, this really works better than
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   anything else.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We're going to put this button there."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And it's still there today.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's kind of, it kind of speaks for the, the, the solidity or the, the integrity of the
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   search engine itself to say, "You know what?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Every time we, every time you go to do a search, you know, you hit, "I'm feeling lucky more
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   times than not, you're going to get to the page you want to get to."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   So I, I think that speaks volumes to Google's ethos and the way that they develop their
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   products.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   For the most part.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.640]   And it's not just the existence of a button that will take you to their best guests.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.800]   It's the language on the button that is so informal and so kind of just casual colloquial
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.440]   speech and to hover your mouse pointer over the button that'll, I'm feeling hungry and
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.800]   all this other stuff.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:59.160]   It's just a, it's, that's a wonderful homage to their origins and it's nice that it's
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   still there.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.800]   I also think it's worth pointing out that as part of their celebrations, they rolled
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.000]   out the new quote unquote flat design for the logo, for, for the, yeah, for the logo.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.360]   And I think it looks fantastic.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   It looks great.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.520]   It looks very consistent with their company wide design look and feel.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.160]   And I think it's fascinating that Yahoo did this huge contest and like they made a big
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.600]   deal about their redesign thing and they came out, they ended up with a logo that looks
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.520]   like 1998 with the drop shadow.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.040]   And I remember in the nineties, like there's drop shadows and sort of like the 3D looking
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   as what everybody, that was what was happening.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.880]   And that became obsolete like 10 years ago.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   And it's just shocking that after all of that, they came out with such an antiquated looking
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.200]   uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,ography and logo, uh, whereas Google, it just looks, you know, they, they
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.920]   retain the colors and the idea of the original logo, but they've just flattened it and made
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   it 2013.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.720]   I really like it.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.600]   And it's interesting now to look at, to look at Google, um, and you know, what they are
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.160]   now as a company, they're a huge company.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.800]   They've got billions of dollars in the bank.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.560]   They've got this set of core products and this huge business and advertising with lots, lots
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   of money in the bank.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.680]   And they've, and in a way, they're sort of turning themselves into this like moonshot company
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.600]   who's trying, you know, big audacious things like, you know, self-driving cars and project
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   loon and, and, and glass.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.040]   Um, but if you, if you rewind to 15 years ago, like their original mission, you know, which
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.200]   is to, I guess to organize the world's information, I think, I think that, I think that's the
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.480]   phrase to organize all the world's information.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.080]   Like that was a huge moonshot.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.840]   You know, back then that just seemed, that just seemed insane.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.600]   And especially as the web was just exploding.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.320]   Um, you know, not only do you Google have to make a search engine to find everything that
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.360]   already exists in the web, but it had to grow at the rate at which the web was growing.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.520]   And then of course with books and things, you see them, you know, scanning.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.400]   Um, so it's, you know, in maps and I mean, it just, it just exploded.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.120]   I mean, it just, you know, of course it was a talented team and, and a cohesive vision,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.520]   but it was, it was, it was just something really magical, not to sound like a total fan girl,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.960]   though I guess this is the show to do it on is something magical happened with this company.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.680]   Um, and, and a lot of things went right.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.760]   I mean, certainly a lot of things gone wrong, but more things went right.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   That's for sure.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.800]   Well, one of the, you know, this whole moonshot concept, I think is, um, very key to the company.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.600]   Everything, even the stuff that isn't a moonshot is a moonshot.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.840]   When you, you know, when you read about, you know, in the plex and some of these other
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.600]   books about the internal meetings that they have at Google, um, the way they go is somebody
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   says, you know, we should, uh, we should sort of take a picture of everybody's house in,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   uh, in Mountain View and, and layer, we're going to picture of everybody's house in
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   the world.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.240]   We're going to, you know, every time there's an idea, it's like, let's do this ridiculously
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.560]   large version of that idea.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   And then they do it.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   And then that's really what, what Google is all about.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.400]   They're just about massive thinking, like really, really big thinking.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.000]   And that's, that's, I think, been a key to their success.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.240]   Don't you guys think that that's, it seems like they not lost it, but it seems like that
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.280]   they kind of declined in that aspect, the moonshot aspect until, you know, Larry came,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.360]   came on as, do you guys agree?
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.080]   I mean, it seems like with Larry now, everything's like, okay, let's focus on these, these core
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.720]   things and then come up with these, this subset of, of really big ideas, like Google
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.240]   Glass and some other ones, right?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.480]   And self-driving cars.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.560]   I think they've jettisoned the little ideas that, for example, Google Reader, which I
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.280]   think was a huge mistake for them to get rid of specifically because some of the heaviest
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.800]   users are influencers.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.200]   So I think it's a bad PR move for them to get rid of reader.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.400]   They should just sustain it forever because the kinds of people who were heavy reader
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.840]   users are going to be very active people online, very influential.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.400]   But that's a, that's, that's, that is not a moonshot, big thinking type of projects.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   It's an RSS reader.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.440]   This is the best one, but it was just an RSS reader.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.520]   Whereas if you look at something like maps, no, they, they, they're, they're not necessarily
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.040]   going to launch any new project as huge as maps, but look at what they've done with maps
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   itself.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.640]   The whole ground truth concept of this is creating a major, you know, the matrix inside
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:25.480]   this mapping thing where they actually 3D map every inch of the earth's surface in a
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.200]   way that gets high resolution, the more people use it and the more activity there is around
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.600]   it.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.840]   That is a huge undertaking that, you know, if, if somebody told me, you know, 15 years
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.720]   ago that somebody wanted to do what Google has actually already done, I'd say you're
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   nuts.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.840]   That's not just simply not conceivably possible.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.320]   It's true.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   It is true.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.720]   So happy birthday Google.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   Happy birthday Google.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.240]   I hope that, I hope that Google can continue to build products that people need, you know,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.320]   that people don't know that they need, but do need desperately on the web the way that
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   they did with search.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   Now, I remember back in the day thinking, if you would ask me before I started using
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.760]   Google, you know, in the, in the early 2000s, do I, do you need a new search engine?
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.600]   I would have been like, nah, Altavist is fine.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Yahoo's fine.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   Right?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.880]   And so I started using Google and was like, oh, this is, this is amazing.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   Right?
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.080]   But, you know, I think in a lot of ways, like people, users needs, particularly like global
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.520]   internet users needs, or maybe moving, moving past or evolving to things in addition to
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.760]   web search.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.600]   And I want to see, I hope that Google can continue to deliver on those things.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.480]   And so, and actually Mike, this is kind of a controversial statement, especially with
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.320]   you here because you make such good use of it.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.320]   But, you know, a lot of people would say that Google+, which is, you know, Google's move
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.080]   into social, you know, looking at, I think, you know, the, the threats or the, or what
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.920]   was going on with Facebook, and kind of coming with their own social product that, you know,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   maybe hasn't seen, I know, I know, you, you can take me when I say this, hasn't seen the
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.760]   uptake, maybe that, you know, that, that a Facebook or a Twitter has seen, hasn't seen
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.000]   that sort of hockey stick growth, hasn't gotten great reviews.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.800]   And the way that they're integrating social across other products, I actually think that
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.640]   the way that they're integrating Google+, across their products, particularly in communities
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.160]   that already existed like YouTube is a really good thing for everyone.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.880]   And I think it's kind of happening slowly, and that there's some backlash, particularly
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.600]   when they're, you know, put a moving Google+, into an existing community like YouTube, where
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.160]   people are used to their old tools, and now they have to deal with a new tool.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.320]   But, but, you know, I don't, I, Google's never said this, but I don't know that Google+,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.960]   was, you know, maybe the instantaneous success, or maybe the success that they, that they
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.600]   wanted to be right away.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:44.000]   I don't know, you, you know, Mike, you, you use, you've over 2 million in circulars.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.680]   I don't even know what the term is followers, I guess, on Google+, and you, and you, and
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.200]   you use your primary writing tool, and you use it for everything, not just writing, but
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.040]   hangouts and all those things.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   And, and you see, is it, yeah, yeah, and you see the product as a huge success.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.080]   I mean, you've said straight up that it's quantifiedly the best social network out there,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.120]   and that's why you spend your time on it.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.160]   Do you find that your family and friends, though, are also there, or did you find a new
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   audience on, on plus?
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.240]   They are not there.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.400]   And, and that is the single biggest problem with it, is that the thing that people do on
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.480]   Facebook, which is, you know, my old high school friends, my college friends, my family, my
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:29.640]   extended family, you know, my coworkers, my former coworkers, all on Facebook, and that
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.000]   activity of following what people are doing and sharing their lives and it's all personal,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.200]   and I know all those people, it's very, very compelling to, to a huge number of people.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.600]   And that's why if you look at Facebook's user, you know, the amount that people use it, it's
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.760]   huge.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.000]   People spend hours and hours and hours on Facebook.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.960]   It's a very, very compelling thing that's happening on Facebook, and to a certain extent,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.680]   the reason for that is Facebook was the big social network at the moment when everybody
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   got on social network.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.880]   A long time social networking was, and Facebook itself was just college, you know, originally
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.320]   it was just Harvard, then it was just Ivy League, then it was just colleges, then the
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.920]   high school kids came along, and then there was a point at which were, you know, those
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.360]   people's parents and grandparents and everybody got on a Facebook, and at that moment it's
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.840]   like a game of musical chairs, there was one chair, and everybody sat down on the Facebook
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   chair.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.280]   And now that they've, they have what Facebook has what I call a monopoly on everybody, everybody's
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.920]   on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook, and that's the only reason everybody's on
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.520]   Facebook.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.600]   And so, you know, for something like Google+ to come along, Google+ has many things that
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   Facebook is not.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.120]   But one of the things Google+ is, is it's also a version, you know, a type of Facebook.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.440]   You know, it's one of its many hats that it wears, it's that it's Google's Facebook.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.360]   And in that sense, it's really a lousy place to have that Facebook experience where you
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.760]   interact with everybody you know, because everybody you know isn't there.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.120]   I mean, that's very clear.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:13.640]   And that's, that's a specific, the thing that is very interesting in this context, two things
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.320]   that are interesting about it.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   Around the world, the whole Facebook thing is less of a phenomenon.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:25.680]   Like, for example, in the Middle East, Africa and a lot of other countries, the whole interact
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.760]   with your existing, the people you know is not as important as meeting new people and
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.640]   interacting with those people.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.760]   And so Google is, you see the high numbers on Google and you're like, well, how could
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   it be that high?
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.960]   Like, you know, and the reason is it's kind of more international.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.800]   It's been more quickly accepted.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.680]   And one of the reasons it's more accepted internationally is that Google has these programs
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   where you can use Google+ for free.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.600]   You know, it's not counted against your minutes in India and other countries.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   A bunch of other reasons like that.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.840]   But the problem is that for Facebook, and I'm predicting that Google will surpass Facebook
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.400]   in active users in about the end of next year, so in about, you know, a little more than
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   a year from now.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.360]   And that after that, Facebook will sort of slide into MySpace land.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   Part of the reason for that is that once Facebook loses this sort of like everybody's,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.640]   this is the only place where everybody is, they got nothing.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   They have nothing.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.120]   They have a horrible interface.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.080]   The ads are intrusive.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.840]   The security is problematic.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.920]   Nobody trusts them.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.640]   They really have a lot working against them.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.280]   And once they lose that monopoly on everybody, they're done.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.920]   And whereas Google+ is very slowly gaining the monopoly on everybody.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.680]   Kids are leaving Facebook because they're tired of being spied on and sort of interacting
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.200]   so much, so publicly with their extended relatives.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:01.560]   And so they're looking for the anonymous sources of social networking like Tumblr and so on.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.960]   And Google+ happens to be a fantastic place to do that kind of social networking as well.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.440]   So I really believe in the long game for Google+, I think that, you know, within three years
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.560]   or four years, it'll pretty much be the only major all-purpose social network that matters.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.800]   There'll be lots of, always be lots of little tiny ones.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.520]   But I think that the changing of the guard is pretty much inevitable unless something
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.040]   crazy weird happens.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.720]   But yeah, I mean, but it's absolutely true that right now, Facebook is a much better
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Facebook than Google+ is.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.000]   Google+ is a better Twitter than Twitter and I could go on and on with other social networks.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.320]   A better path than path.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:48.520]   But that thing with like your high school friends, Google+ doesn't have that yet.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.960]   But also, I find it's easier to start with Google+ and Mike, you're a big, I follow your
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.760]   method of posting from Google+ out to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.120]   So thank you very much for that.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.280]   But I find that it's a great place to start.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.400]   You know, you post in Google+ things automatically for me anyway, things automatically get posted
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.800]   to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.320]   If people want to follow me there, they can.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.080]   But I never go to Facebook or Twitter.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.160]   You know, Gina, like when you and other people start talking about, "Oh, Twitter's doing
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   this.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   I'm like clueless."
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   Right?
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.600]   I use the web interface sometimes if someone, you know, retweet something I say or something
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   like that.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   Maybe I want to see who that is.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.640]   But I hardly ever go there.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.240]   And right now, I'm fairly comfortable having the separate worlds of like, you know, family
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.160]   and friends are on Facebook and everything else is kind of on Google+.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.760]   It makes it really, it's like, it's in a nice container right now.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.720]   I mean, it'll be great when they can come over and luckily with Google+ the mechanisms
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.480]   are there to filter out or just look at this circle versus this circle and things like
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   that.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.720]   It makes it really easy.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.040]   But right now I'm kind of comfortable.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.400]   It's like, yeah, I go to Google+, I can follow all the discussions on Google, Android, open
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.840]   source, making stuff.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.360]   And I don't really care where those people are coming from, whether they're friends,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   whether I know them.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   I'm just looking for interesting ideas at that point.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   And so we'll see.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   I mean, for me, the other thing about Google+ is Google's done a very good job.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.640]   It seems like of tailoring the discussions that I see on my homepage so that it is the
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.160]   things I'm most interested in.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.440]   Unlike Facebook, when I go to Facebook, it's a blah.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.880]   Like someone threw up all over the page.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.360]   Here's all the stuff that everybody's talking about.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.880]   But on Google+, it seems like they're doing a really good job tailoring the discussion
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   to what I'm interested in.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.440]   And they have to do that because really Google is all about where it's all going.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.480]   And Gina, you're a Google+ user as I am, and you see that Google+ and the coming Google
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.960]   watch and wearable computing in general is going to be a whole different set of priorities
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:55.240]   and processes for social communication where there has to be machine filtering, there
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.800]   has to be sorting, filtering, whatever.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:05.720]   And you know that once you start using Google+, Google+ is basically the sort of mind-melt
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.600]   between the user and Google+.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:17.800]   When you just say, "Okay, Glass, take a picture," and then hit share, off it goes to Google+.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.200]   And then when there's a message, it's sort of automatic.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   It comes in.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.520]   Of course, there'll be apps for all the social networks and so on.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.840]   But really, I think Google Glass is the first glimpse we have into the coming world where
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   Google+ is central simply because it's the central place where you interact with all your
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.160]   Google stuff.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.520]   And there's going to be further integration.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.000]   We've had a recent integration with YouTube.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.280]   I think there'll be a point at which YouTube.com will just redirect you to Google+ and video
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.440]   and all that stuff will happen right in YouTube.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.480]   I think we're coming very close to a point where bloggers on Blogger.com, where there
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.320]   would be no distinction for those used it between a public post on Google+ and posting
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   on their blog.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.720]   And you can post either on Blogger or Google+ and no matter which one you post on, it shows
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   up in the other.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.880]   It's the same set of comments except on Blogger.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.720]   You have your little design and on Google+, you don't.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.440]   Those kinds of deep integrations, it'll get to the point where it's just to use Google
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.080]   would be to use Google+.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.760]   And it will be the best thing to use because of those integrations.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:34.400]   So Google+ as glue is a super compelling idea that Google is completely focused on.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.600]   Yeah, I mean for me, it is those services and those integrations.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.840]   I use Google+ because I have instant upload enabled on my Android device.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.480]   The Android integration alone is huge.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.640]   I sign in with Google a lot more because those buttons are just in my apps.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.920]   I use instant upload.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.520]   I want to embed comments on my blog and I'm just going to use Google+ because Google+
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.920]   has great commenting and threading.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.120]   So even though I'm not necessarily going to plus.google.com and composing a post very
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.920]   often, I agree that those integrations and services around Google+ are very compelling.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.440]   I got to say, once I enabled instant upload and it took me a while to do so, but once
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.960]   I enabled it, I take tons of pictures of my daughter and the baby all the time and all
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.680]   those auto features, the auto awesomes are so great.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.160]   I really see the value of that.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.880]   The reason why I don't actually write posts on Google+ and particularly the way you outline
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.360]   Mike of doing a good post, you get a great high res photo, use formatting bold, italic,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.560]   include links, make it kind of a compelling post.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.240]   It looks a lot like a blog post.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.160]   See, the reason why I use social networks, I use Twitter particularly, is because I don't
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.680]   have to do any of that work.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.600]   I can just type a few words and put a link and I'm done and everyone's tweets are the
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   same.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.960]   You look at your Google+ page and you've obviously put a lot of time and effort and it's finding
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.000]   images and writing the right teasers and creating headlines.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.760]   To me, I'm kind of like, "Why wouldn't I just do that on my own site?"
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.080]   At one point, it feels like a lot of work.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   It feels like more work.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:07.680]   It doesn't feel as frictionless as the word that Zuck would use as maybe some of the other
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   places.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:16.920]   I think that's just a matter of what you're looking for or what you want to do.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.040]   If Google+ is something like it just collects all the things I plus want and helps me do
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.200]   something useful with them, then fine.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.160]   If it's a place where I'm just going to install and upload my photos and do cool things with
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.320]   them, then let me share the friends and family that are on there.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.640]   Think about the friends and family not being on Google+ though.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.320]   Google+ has a user acquisition problem.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   I hear that you're saying that people don't join Google+ because their friends aren't there,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.440]   but their friends aren't there because no one's joining Google+.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.600]   It really is kind of a chicken and egg problem.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:52.720]   We've seen networks like Instagram and Snapchat and Path even have these huge growth rates
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.560]   very quickly for small startups.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.480]   Of course, we have different expectations for a big company like Google than we do for
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.560]   small startups, but we've seen huge user spikes happen very quickly.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.280]   That just didn't quite happen with Google+.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.360]   I think that there is a user acquisition problem.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.320]   I don't know if it's about the complexity.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.760]   I don't know if there's too many different messages around what Google+ is.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.040]   Is it Hangouts?
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.560]   Is it Comments?
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.560]   What is it?
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.840]   But I do think that Google has some problems to solve there.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.040]   There's a huge thing about it.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.320]   There is a huge thing about expectations.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.640]   Snoop Dogg is in more circles than Path has users.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.520]   The scale is totally different.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:44.000]   The thing about, you had mentioned the ability to toss off a Twitter, a quick Twitter thing.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.440]   Here's a snarky comment off it goes.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   It's pretty consequential.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.120]   Whereas when you do a Google+ post, you think, "I'm stepping up to the microphone in this big
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.720]   room in front of people."
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.400]   It feels like if it's so public, it feels so consequential.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.680]   The other part of that, of course, is on Twitter, it's trivial to monitor a feed.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.280]   You can follow a huge number of people on everything so short that whereas on Google+
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.200]   you can really get bogged down with information overload because they can be such long posts.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.000]   But I toss off all kinds of things.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   For every public post that, as you point out, is nicely formatted and all that kind of stuff,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.520]   I probably post two or three privately to different groups, my family, friends, whatever.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   I just toss up whatever.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.120]   I don't format anything.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:35.240]   I go all the way down to life logging where I post a lot of things that I don't share
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.480]   with anybody except myself just to keep track of my own life.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.600]   Google Glass really facilitates that.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.920]   With Google Glass, you're like, "Oh, here's a picture.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.640]   I don't really want to share this with anybody, but I want to remember this moment.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   Boom.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.640]   It's up there, done.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.000]   I don't have to think about it."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.440]   They mention at Google I/O that for every post that's public, there are two that are
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.200]   not public.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.360]   Lots and lots of people are using Google+, and you never know it because unless you're
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.000]   in their private circle, you're not going to see their posts.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.680]   It's got a creeping acceptance factor that I think is more than what appears at first.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   The other point I want to make is that I think that people have trouble understanding the
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.160]   actual magnitude of how much is posted there.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   I try to post things that are very timely.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.520]   If a bunch of people have posted something, some news about some gadget or something like
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.960]   that, I'm not going to do another post.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.760]   I might share or I might not.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   What I do before I post anything is I go and I search Google+ to see my finger on the
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.600]   pulse of how much this has already been posted.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.240]   In the first year or so, it was very often that, "Oh, nobody's posted on this.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.400]   I'm going to be the first to post on this."
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.720]   Now that never happens.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.440]   I'll have something that I think is the most bleeding edge information.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.480]   I'll do a search and there's 400 posts on it already.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:16.920]   If you look underneath the surface, there's so much activity on Google+ it's just monstrous.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.000]   Part of it is the circle limitations.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.440]   If you could circle 10,000 people, it would just be completely overwhelming.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.960]   I think there's more going on than us tech pundits really realize.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   I think so too.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.280]   Because of the interaction that he has there with other photographers, the community's
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:52.920]   aspect of Google+ he says he learns tips, tricks, hooking up with people for photo hunts
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.400]   or photo walks.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.880]   Sounds like he really learned about photography from Google+ because of the community in the
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:07.080]   way it's so easy to find other people that have the same opinions and things like that.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.600]   It seems like just getting to your point of what you were saying, Mike, about the other
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.240]   aspects of Google+ beyond just what you might see or what you might think, how you might
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   think people are using it.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   I think that...
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   Go ahead, Jean.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   No, go ahead.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   Okay.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:28.120]   You had mentioned the benefit of easy auto uploading.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   It's really worth doing.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.640]   I think you were at Google...
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   I know you were the last year's Google IO.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.000]   I'm pretty sure you were at this year's as well.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.840]   I was too when they rolled out all the photo magic stuff.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.040]   That's one of those things that you really have to pause and go, "Wow.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.480]   This is just beyond any...
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.920]   Sci-fi people didn't even predict this."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.720]   Not only does the picture go up automatically, and then Google decides which are the best
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.080]   pictures and says, "You can look at all your pictures you want, but here's the thing
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   here's the other good ones."
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.640]   Which is the mental process you do anyway when you take a gazillion pictures.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:11.480]   Then it takes those and it puts little subtle, essentially, Photoshop improvements on them,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.320]   which are always reversible.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.080]   People talk about auto awesome and they always talk about the animated GIF, but auto awesome
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   does several things.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.880]   One of the craziest things that it does did this for me recently.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.160]   I went to a family wedding.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.600]   My family weddings, everybody's posing, everybody lines up and smiles when you take a picture.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   I have this really fast canon.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.520]   I take 10 pictures as easily as I take one.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:39.800]   It was doing that thing where there's a picture that's the best picture except one person
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.400]   who is blinking.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:47.920]   Google will create another picture, grab the open eyes from another picture and put it
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.360]   in there so that you have one picture that never happened.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.400]   Everybody smiles, everybody's got their eyes open.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.640]   It just does that subtly.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.680]   If you see a shot like that that has the little magic pixie dust logo icon thing in the corner
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:10.480]   of the picture, this is just crazy that it does that.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.120]   This is before you touch anything.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.680]   It's already doing that.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   It's just crazy.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.440]   It makes my photos delightful.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.320]   If I look out through my photos on my phone, I see a lot of blurry stuff.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.680]   I see a lot of bad pictures and that one good picture.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.840]   If I go on Google+ and I think it defaults to just your highlights.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.400]   It always shows me my best pictures and the collages and the gifts.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.360]   I didn't realize he was doing that open eye thing.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.200]   I always am just like, "Oh, yeah.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.400]   I always feel happy looking at my photos."
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.240]   That's all stuff that I would do if I had taken the time to do it, but it was always
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.200]   such a drag and I often didn't do it.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.640]   That is the photo stuff really.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.360]   They didn't hit a home run with that.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.280]   I don't think they get nearly as much credit for it.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.920]   That's what, Gina, you're life logging.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.520]   You probably post only a minority of your photos publicly or even privately.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.080]   Those photos are there.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:10.880]   That's a visual diary of your life in reverse chronological order that is just priceless
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   and private.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   You're actually life logging and probably never intended to.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.960]   I think Google would have made a huge mistake if they had done something like, "We're going
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.160]   to automatically share."
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:28.000]   If you want to use the auto upload, we're automatically going to post that to your circles
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.440]   or something or two others following you.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.360]   I think that there was a moment there where I don't know if it was ever even thought about.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.960]   If they had done some of those things, they take a very, when they develop a new feature
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.120]   for the most part, it seems like they take a very good approach in that, "Hey, look,
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.840]   we're going to automatically update your photos, but we're not going to make those public."
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   You get to go in and choose which ones you want to make public or choose which ones you
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.360]   can take off the auto correct and the auto magic, whatever it is.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.160]   It seems like they're making wise decisions, which I think is another thing that they seem
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.760]   to be doing well.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.880]   The question I want to ask you guys as long as we're on this topic, and then I want to
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.480]   hear about Hummingbird because Gina mentioned that earlier, the question I want to ask you
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.360]   guys is, "What's the prediction?
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:16.200]   What would be the feature or maybe it's not a feature, maybe it's something else that puts,
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.480]   as far as the US is concerned, it puts Google+ over the top."
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.160]   Mike, you mentioned in other countries, they give you free access if you're coming in from
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.080]   a Google Android operating system or something.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   What's that one feature?
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   What do we think?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   What's the prediction?
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.160]   That's easy.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:41.040]   When Google really opens it up, the developers and enables developers to build stuff based
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.320]   on Google for real, Google+ for real.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.080]   That's going to be killer.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.000]   It's going to open up.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.280]   It's going to launch a thousand startups that are going to do crazy good stuff.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:01.920]   It's crazy to think that to this day, Google+ is pretty closed.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.360]   Developers are pretty much locked out.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.880]   I just think that's just going to be a singularity where everything changes.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.040]   They've been pretty measured in the access that developers have.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.360]   You certainly have all the Google Play services things on Android have tight Google+ integration
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   you have signed in with Google.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.960]   There's still the API.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   It's read-only.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.840]   In fact, this was the question I was going to ask you guys earlier, is that Aaron, you
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.200]   said something like, "Oh, Mike, I use your system for posting starting on Google+," but
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.080]   then, "Sidicating that out to Facebook and Twitter."
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.880]   I still don't know how to do that.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.400]   It still seems not obvious.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.480]   To me, the killer feature, and this is something I feel like just won't happen because of licensing
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.780]   or political or competition reasons, is for these networks to talk to one another more
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:54.080]   freely, and for me to be able to very easily post to all of them, but customize the message.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.160]   I don't want to do plus Mike Elgin on Twitter.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   That looks crazy.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.480]   I don't want to do @Alginon.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.040]   It just looks weird.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.000]   I hate when I see people just clearly blindly posting the same thing across, but I would
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.800]   like for it to be easier when I have something I want to share to be able to broadcast it
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.160]   to my networks in a way that makes it native to that network.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.800]   I think every network has its own culture and its own ways of addressing other people
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.720]   and hashtags and things, although we are starting to see some convergence across those things.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.960]   We're seeing hashtags supported across all the networks now.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.120]   But yes, better integration across these products.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.600]   Yeah, better access to these APIs.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.480]   We're seeing things with Game Center too.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:44.120]   Google is slowly, slowly opening up to developers and making plus a platform with richer APIs,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.880]   but it's been slow and it feels very measured.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.400]   It feels very much like this is only what Google wants developers to do with this and
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   nothing else.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.040]   They are so concerned.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.240]   I think it's Vic and Notra who's behind this.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.680]   He is so intense to not blow it.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:11.880]   Because I think Google blew it with buzz with almost every or every prior social site.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.560]   They screwed it up in some fundamental way.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.200]   I think Google is just above all.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.000]   They just don't want to screw it up.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.160]   They know they have a great thing going and they just want to be very conservative and
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   move forward very conservatively and just get it right.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.800]   I would like to see them move faster personally.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.240]   The privacy issue that you brought up, Aaron, about the default being not sharing.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.480]   I think Google learned some hard lessons, particularly around privacy when it came to
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   buzz.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   When I instead upload 100 photos and I don't share any of those and they're just sitting
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.760]   on Google servers, that only costs Google money.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.760]   I'm not sharing that with anyone.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.440]   They get information about me, which makes me a little bit more valuable based on the
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440]   photos.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.080]   Now we know that they know what is contained in the photos.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.720]   They know if it's flowers or babies or chocolate or whatever.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.840]   They get more information about me.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.760]   If I'm not sharing to others, it's less valuable to them.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.280]   They made that decision that should be private.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.240]   That was one of my first concerns about glass.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.880]   When I take a picture, does this mean this is automatically going to go out to my circle?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.720]   No, that's the right decision.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.400]   I think they learned those lessons with buzz particularly.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.760]   That is so easy to do.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.600]   Have you posted anything accidentally?
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.520]   It's extremely easy to do.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:35.160]   You go share and it just starts happening and they give you like three seconds to cancel.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.000]   Kevin Purdy showed his glass to a friend of his who took a photo of himself looking in
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.960]   a mirror and accidentally shared it.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.400]   The caption was, "I think I just accidentally shared something."
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.920]   I've actually shared twice.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:57.120]   I've shared a public post that said, except through glass with a hashtag, just by handling
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.640]   the glass, just by taking it out of my backpack or whatever.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.240]   I find that later that I essentially did the Google Glass equivalent of butt dialing.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.160]   It's funny, actually.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.040]   They're often butt pictures because I will lay glass down on a tabletop and walk away
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.080]   and it's the waist level.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.440]   Upside down, right?
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.640]   I'm like, "Please don't auto share a picture of somebody's butt.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   Am I just, please?
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   Especially not mine."
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.480]   Don't generate a hashtag, please.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480]   Right.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   Exactly.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.440]   I wanted to ask you guys real quick, unless only if it's really complicated.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.320]   In summary, what do you guys are using a particular tool to post a cross, to post to
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.560]   Google+, and then Facebook and Twitter?
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.160]   Or is there a particular client?
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   Or are you doing copy and paste?
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   Is there an extension?
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.720]   How are you doing it?
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.240]   There are two tools that I think are extremely useful.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   One is friends plus me.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:56.160]   I use friends plus me to auto post to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.720]   If you look at my Facebook stream with a mobile device, it looks perfect.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.160]   It just looks like I posted on Facebook.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.960]   If you look on the web, it's a funky tiny little thumbnail thing and it's not.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.120]   But the whole post is there.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.560]   There's a link back to Google+, which is the most important thing to me because I want
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.240]   to have one conversation and not a bunch of conversations.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.760]   Twitter is perfect, except for this whole @ and plus thing.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   But I do a headline and I do other stuff.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   Friends plus me takes the headline.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:32.160]   It makes that the tweet and then puts a shortened link, which goes back to the full post on
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.880]   Google+, it's perfect.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   And LinkedIn is perfect.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.120]   So friends plus me is really, really good.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.280]   And they now support groups.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.360]   They now support groups on LinkedIn and Facebook.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.240]   So you can do that flexibly.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:54.520]   And then there's also something called DoShare, which is it's a little funky in it that they're
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.840]   struggling against the fact that they don't have right API access to Google+, but it enables
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.920]   you to save posts and to schedule them.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.480]   So you can have posts going out every hour or whatever on a schedule.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.440]   It works 95% of the time beautifully.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.240]   There's a couple of little things you learn to deal with some of the idiosyncrasies of
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   it.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.960]   But that's another great tool for people who would like to do some of the things it can
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.560]   do.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:29.640]   I used to use Manage Flitter, but Friends plus me is better for posting from Google+, automatically
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.320]   So I used Friends plus me.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.520]   And you said DoShare, is it a Chrome plugin?
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   It's a Chrome plugin.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   Yes, exactly.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.520]   Gotcha.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.840]   Yeah, it seems like these tools are sort of rapidly evolving.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:47.400]   And I figured that whatever you're using might be changing a little bit because things are
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   things are changing.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:53.320]   And it seems like to programmatically post something in the language of a particular
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   network is kind of hard.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   But though, I like the idea that it's just taking the headline and then shortening a
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.080]   link to your Google+ post.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.840]   And so that's the canonical location of the thing that you put up.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.640]   I like that a lot.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.920]   You can also generate -- there are numerous tools for generating an RSS feed from your
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.360]   public posts.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.080]   And once you have an RSS feed, you can, like for example, I generate an email newsletter
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.040]   from my Google+ posts.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.960]   It's on hiatus right now, but I did it for about a year and something.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.240]   And I'll get them to be doing it again.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.440]   But basically, that's pretty cool.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.840]   And once you have RSS, you can do lots of things with that.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.040]   So that's another sort of -- you know, all of these things are kind of work around-ish.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.240]   You know, they're not exactly what you want.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.880]   But you know, they exist and they can be very helpful.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.600]   You know, I always still come back to that question of like, well, if I'm going to do
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.160]   all this work to make it work on Google+, why wouldn't I just write on my own site and
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.040]   my own domain, you know, using a tool that I own or, you know, data that I own and do
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   this that way?
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   But at the same time, like, I'm just not going to set up services.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.680]   You know, it's the same reason why I use Gmail versus running my own iMAP server, you know,
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.240]   which I did for years, is like the time that I would have to spend to do the maintenance
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.440]   and have it work as well as Gmail does is just not worth it to me.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   And for something particular like the photo stuff, you know, like, I'm just not going
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.960]   to do that stuff manually in BACASA.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.800]   I'm not going to write the scripts, the software to do it myself, you know, for me automatically.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.320]   So it's just easier.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.240]   So I get it, but it does sound like you like you spent a lot of time kind of working around
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   and using different tools.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.600]   You're definitely pushing the edge of the platform and kind of doing all the hacks that
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.040]   you need to do to make it work for you.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.320]   I mean, the RSS thing, that was, that took a bit of figuring out.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.280]   It took me a day to figure that out a long time ago.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.640]   And friends plus me has to be set up.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.800]   But in both of those cases, once it's set up, it's, you're done.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   You don't touch it.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   You don't think about it.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   It just works.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:53.160]   And, you know, in perpetuity, there's just no, oh, do share you go in and interact with
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.040]   the site itself or the, you know, the plug in itself every time.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.720]   But you know, it's, it's, it can be worth it.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.360]   But again, as you were implying, you know, for most people, you're going to have a Google
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.440]   password, like something is going to like require, so you have a Google password.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.720]   And you're probably going to want to do certain things of Google.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.640]   So you're going to have a Google+ account.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   Okay.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.600]   You kind of have to have a Google+ account almost for some people.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.760]   And since you have a Google+ account, you don't really need a Facebook account if you
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.640]   have these tools that auto post.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.800]   You know, it's, it's not ideal to post through these things, but it's, it's better than wasting
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.040]   your time on Facebook.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   And, and so it's, it's really, this, this is what Google is going to keep doing.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.240]   They're going to keep adding these things, you know, the, they've already announced
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.560]   that Google+ is going to be the social network for their whole new Android gaming universe.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   Right.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   Right.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.120]   And if that gets huge, then you were going to see, you know, so you one by one, they're
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:58.480]   going to use Google+ to be the basic social platform for all of the stuff that they do.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.960]   So to use Google will be to use Google+, and since you're using Google+, for one thing,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.640]   you might as well use it for the other thing.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   Right.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.240]   They're clearly committed to it as a platform going forward.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.000]   Well, when they held that 15th birthday, press event at the old, at the old garage, the original
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.600]   garage where the company started, and it made me a little nervous, you know, the homepage
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.080]   thing and the garage thing made me a little nervous because I think, you know, looking
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.320]   to the past and getting nostalgic is one thing.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.480]   And I think that that's something that big companies kind of do a lot, especially when
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.760]   they're struggling with their big companyness is to sort of get nostalgic and sort of make,
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.080]   you know, kind of the old days, kind of this golden era or something.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.120]   I always want to, I'd rather much, I'd much rather hear about what the future is, but
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.480]   happily Google did make a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, it's kind of small announcements
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.240]   about changes that they've made, particularly to search at that event.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   They have added in search results, particularly, kind of sticking to the core product there.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.200]   They've added comparisons and filters into the knowledge graph.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.560]   So if you search for something like, this is the example they gave, you search for impressionist
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.040]   artists, you'll get this kind of banner across the top of the page and then you can filter
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.800]   by different kinds of, kinds of artists.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   So expressionist, cubist, modernist, realist, which is kind of nice.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.920]   So it's like, this is again, Google, Jeff, if Jeff Jarvis was here, he would say that
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   they're trying to intuit, you know, your intent.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.440]   Another thing that you do, that they do knowledge graph comparison.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.000]   So if you wanted to know what the fat content was of olive oil versus butter, if you search
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.200]   for olive oil versus butter, you would see, you know, the knowledge graph tables, which
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.360]   would normally show up on the, on the right hand side, show up right there at the top of
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.240]   the search results and kind of compare the two.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   And Chad is bringing them up.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   Yeah, right there.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   Thanks, Chad.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.800]   So yeah, so you can see how many grams of fat are in olive oil versus butter, the number
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.680]   of calories, which is really nice.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.720]   So Google's just trying to get really smart about what you're looking for.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.680]   So continuing on a theme that they talked about at IO is this idea that everybody uses
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.840]   different devices and that you should be able to get the same information across your devices
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.440]   and the devices, because you kind of be aware of one another.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.040]   The next couple of weeks, new version of the Google search app is launching on iPhone
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.320]   and iPad.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   And so you'll get notifications across your devices.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.320]   So if you do on your Nexus 7, if you say, okay, Google, you know, remind me to buy olive
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:26.000]   oil at Safeway when you walk in the store with your iPhone, you'll get a push notification
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.160]   to get olive oil, which is really nice.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.200]   And this is something that we, those of us who are using Android have had for a while.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.000]   But now that it's on iOS, you can see, get the benefits across devices.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.480]   And you can see, Gina, in both of those cases, in both the cases of the knowledge-based comparison
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.720]   and of the sort of the information following around on a device, these are very wearable
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.720]   computing-centric ideas.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.200]   And it's all about your invisible friend.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.440]   It's all about Google Voice Search, Google Now.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:02.600]   And it's going to get to the point where you just talk and you don't care which device
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   is listening.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   Is it your car?
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   Is it your house?
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   Is it your TV?
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   Is it your phone?
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Is it your tablet?
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   Is your computer?
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   Is it your watch?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   Is it your glass?
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   You won't care.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.440]   You just say, I want to know this information or remind me to do XYZ.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.400]   And it won't care which device, you won't care which device, and it won't care which
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.840]   device it tells you about the result later.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:32.280]   So it's really going to be this sort of invisible friend that is just ubiquitous, just ambient.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   And all of their search stuff is sort of being re-engineered to make that possible.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   Yeah, and they're converging upon that one design, the very mobile touch-friendly, the
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   car design.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.480]   Yeah, the Google Now car design, the glass design, which I imagine is going to be the
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.560]   watch design, which is a really great UI.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.240]   It works across a lot of devices.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.560]   So we're going to get that consistent, that nice consistent design.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.240]   Hummingbird, which is the code name for the new search algorithm, like I said, rolled
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.920]   out like a month ago.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.960]   And from what I understand, and Aaron, let me know if I don't get this right, Hummingbird
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.640]   basically lets you ask questions of Google, but it extrapolates what you mean by the previous
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   query.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.480]   So you could say something like, where's the Eiffel Tower and how tall is it?
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.720]   And it knows that it was referring to the Eiffel Tower and can give you those answers.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   So yeah, it's to answer kind of long questions or a line of questioning.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.880]   Right, so it's a line of questioning and it's also about a more natural.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.940]   So it kind of fits in with what we were just talking about, a more natural way to say these
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.940]   things.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:46.440]   Instead of, there's kind of like this secret code of people that are really good at making
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:51.520]   Google work for them, know how to put the search in the search bar.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.720]   And so I'll see like my kids doing searches, I'm like, no, no, no, put this word here and
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.640]   move this there and then put in this little, you know, minus this and it'll get you exactly
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   what you want.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.440]   And you know, it seems magical, but you know, not everyone knows how to do that.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.000]   So I think it seems like what Google's trying to do with Hummingbird is make it a more natural
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   conversation.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.600]   And I think this also enables what they showed at Google I/O where you can say, you
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.960]   know, drive, I forget what the example was there.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.520]   But you know, some lady was trying to drive somewhere and she instead of saying like,
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.440]   you know, drive to this address, she was like, you know, take me home.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.880]   It wasn't even like navigate or anything.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.560]   It was just like, take me home.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   And it knew automatically to turn on navigation and to route her to whatever her home was.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.040]   And I think that's what this is trying to get to.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   So I think this is one step further in that, in that, you know, Nirvana that they anticipate
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.440]   is that kind of like what Mike was saying, you know, you just, you just talk out loud,
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.920]   kind of like the communicator from Star Trek, the next generation, you know, you've always
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.400]   got a device somewhere, whether it's attached to you or nearby.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   And you just say these things and it comes up.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:56.320]   So it's there before you even have to go to a terminal or pull out your phone and you
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.120]   pull out your phone, you turn it on.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:03.600]   That information's already there in the drop down pane or something like that.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.440]   That's what it seems like they're getting at here.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   Right.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   Right.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.680]   So it's almost kind of like there's the death of the search operator.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.320]   I mean, you know, it's like Fray Search and plus, you know, it's like salsa, but not the
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.680]   dance, you know, minus dance.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.720]   You have to, you'd have to know all these special codes, right?
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.000]   But this is, this is the smart Google that you can speak to as if it's another human,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.840]   you know, and it, and it understands what you mean in the context of what you've been
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840]   talking about.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   The context.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.840]   And I know so much about who you are.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.120]   It knows it has context and it knows who you are and what you're talking about.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   Yep.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:41.760]   As I understand it, the new translate algorithms are similar to this in the sense that instead
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:49.400]   of trying to just like do this keyword thing and sort of, you know, just you said this
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   word, so we're going to give you things that have that word in it.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.520]   It's more like people who have all these other criteria have done something similar.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   And so that's going to influence what we're doing.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.280]   It's happening in translate and so on.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   In fact, Amazon's recommendations have kind of operated on that general principle for
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.600]   a long, long time, whereas like, you know, give me a recommendation for a book and they're
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.040]   like, well, we see that you bought this book, that book and the other book and other people
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.400]   who like those three books also like this fourth book.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.600]   And so we're going to recommend this fourth book, you know, that kind of, that kind of
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:27.240]   thinking about search based on, you know, again, it's just massively big data applied
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.280]   to search in a much more holistic way.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   And I would like to say that there have been some critical, you know, snarky report that
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:42.880]   will turn this thing on and nobody noticed as if it was so great, everybody would have
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.880]   noticed.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.000]   But in fact, the fact that nobody noticed is precisely what's so great about it.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   Something like this is built the information behind it, the stuff that makes it good is
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.720]   built by the actions of users themselves.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:06.680]   So like maps, like Google+, like, like a lots of these things, they essentially build the
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:11.160]   infrastructure and then the actions of users make it good.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.680]   And so the fact that they flipped a switch and went to this new system and it wasn't
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.360]   jarringly bad is almost a miracle.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.320]   I mean, that's like amazing.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:24.560]   And then as people use search more over the coming months, you're probably likely to see
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.960]   search get a lot smarter.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.160]   And it's not something you're just going to notice right away.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.880]   You know, the fact that you didn't notice that it was dramatically worse right away is
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.080]   quite a feat of engineering and it's likely to get much better.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.360]   This is a self learning thing.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:52.280]   All search is, all search algorithms are, it's all, it's quality and robustness and the
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.440]   fidelity of it is determined by the actions of millions and billions of users.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.400]   Yep, yep.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.800]   Well, something that we might notice, Android police, great site, they do this, they do
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.080]   this awesome thing where they look at new APKs, new Android apps, they tear them down,
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.640]   they look at the source code and try to predict new features that are coming up.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:18.160]   And they did this recently with the new Gmail release and found that it looks like from
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:25.760]   some XML files and other code that ads are coming to Gmail on Android.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.880]   And I'll be honest, I'm concerned about this.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.800]   I haven't seen ads done really well in a mobile app.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.560]   By too many people, I think if anyone's positioned to do it, Google is positioned to do it.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.360]   But I live in Gmail on Android.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.160]   I process a lot of my email on my phone and I'm wondering, you know, what this is going
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   to look like.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.400]   Is this going to be a banner ad at the bottom of the page?
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.000]   You know, obviously in Gmail kind of in the browser, you have the keyword ads kind of
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.320]   showing up in the right hand column, but you just don't have that kind of real estate
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.560]   on a touchscreen device.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.200]   And I think it's really easy to accidentally tap on an ad when you meant to tap on a reply
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.720]   button or something else.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:06.760]   So I'm really interested to see how Google does this because I think that if they do it,
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:13.240]   if they don't do it well, I think there'll be some backlash from users about them kind
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:18.520]   of being an advertising company and affecting, you know, I think what's a really core experience
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   to Android.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.160]   Do you guys use Gmail on Android?
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.120]   Yeah, I live in it as well.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.520]   I've got multiple email accounts and so they're all set up on my phone.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.480]   So it's really easy for me to go back and forth amongst the four or five Gmail accounts
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.440]   that I have.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   Don't ask me why I do that.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   It's a long story.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.000]   But, you know, I would hate to see, I'm looking at my phone right now.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   You're right about the real estate.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.600]   I mean, they added those icons not too long ago, which takes up some of the real estate
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.320]   from being able to see what the message is about.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.040]   I wasn't too thrilled about that because most of the time it just displays like the first
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.520]   letter of the person's name.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.680]   I found same thing.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   I think it's stupid.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.160]   I wish there was an option to turn that off.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.560]   Anyway, and I'm afraid that the ads are going to end up in line like three email messages
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.920]   and then an ad, which looks like an email message.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.720]   I mean, that's my biggest fear is if that happens, oh man, that's going to be so disappointing.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.480]   If it's a little black bar at the bottom or the other option might be, you know how they
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:19.400]   added recently, they added the view where you can have social and promotions.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:25.120]   I think there's a couple other like that correspond to the tabs that you have in the
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.400]   web view.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.200]   So that could be an option too, where they have one that says ads for people that want
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   to see them.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   I don't know.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.880]   I'm just trying to think of where this because I got the new update and I'm not getting any
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   ads yet.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   So that's good.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.560]   But it's hard to imagine how this could be good.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.760]   You know, it's like, well, they could just drop in the ads as if their email messages
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.800]   as they're doing on in the browser version and that sucks, or they could just take up
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.840]   one third of the screen and that sucks, or they could, you know, they'd like, there's
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.560]   no good way to do that.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.960]   However, having said that, the only way that this is going to be good is if the ads are
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:07.240]   so relevant and so desirable that you want them, no matter what form they come in, the
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.160]   problem with them is, you know, we assume that ads are going to be something we don't
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.160]   want.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.440]   But if they can figure out how to use, you know, it's not a mobile device, if they can
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:20.760]   really finally figure out how to use location and context and what they know about you on
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:28.360]   other services to give you exactly what you would factor to essentially give you search
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.760]   results before you do the search, that would be acceptable.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.200]   Beyond that, it's not going to be popular probably.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.040]   So, like, you know, in Gina's example of where she, in your example, Mike, of where
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:43.080]   you upload a photo, but you don't share it and Google has maybe the location information,
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.440]   maybe you get an email message saying, hey, we realize you're at such and such the corner
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.960]   of such and such intersection.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.800]   By the way, this pizza place is giving you a free slice of pizza if you buy another one
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.120]   or something like that.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.320]   And it would appear in Gmail as opposed to because I may not have maps open, but I'll
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.560]   get that notification if I get a new email message.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:05.640]   So, it could be good in that sense, but I think, yeah, you're right, I'm trending more towards,
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.640]   oh, this sounds like a disaster.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.560]   Yeah, we see Gina that you're uploading a lot of pictures of a baby and therefore you
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.400]   probably need a good stiff drink.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.600]   Here's a bar around the corner.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.400]   That's right.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:24.400]   Yeah, but don't go to the butt picture analogy because then it gets all crazy.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.800]   It gets bad bad.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:30.360]   So some of the strings that Android please found in the XML were, will not save Addis
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.320]   message, will save Addis message, add dismissed.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.080]   So it looks like maybe, you know, dismissed makes it makes me think it'll, it'll show
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:43.200]   up maybe as some sort of toast or maybe, you know, I've sent a message on Gmail and
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.600]   it says message sent.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.520]   By the way, you mentioned something about credit cards.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.440]   Amex has a 10% discount going on.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.720]   You just go dismiss, you know, whatever, you know, I don't know.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.960]   It'll be interesting to see how they handle it.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:02.760]   I hope that it's subtle and relevant and good, better than I've seen most ads.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.640]   I actually think four squares, the only mobile app I use that has done ads of promotions
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   that don't bug me and it actually peeped my interest enough to take advantage.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.960]   Amex had kind of a specials thing going on with four square.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.680]   And now if you check into a place with four square, it'll say like, welcome, you know,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.000]   your friends so and so and so and so have been here.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.440]   By the way, like save money on whatever, you know, to be some sort of like clearly marked
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.640]   ad and it's just like, okay, dismiss.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.160]   I would have seen that anyway.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.600]   And it doesn't, it doesn't interrupt the user flow so much.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.720]   It's just that email is so, so personal.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   And you know, the ads don't bother me in the web browser, but again, you know, you've
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.200]   got so much space there.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   Moving into the physical world of receiving stuff, Google acquired Bufferbox, which is
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:53.680]   a Y Combinator company that puts up kind of, I guess they're little just mailboxes in
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.360]   public places like coffee shops and such.
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.120]   And so you can order from your favorite retailers and have them delivered to your Bufferbox
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.440]   and then you can go pick it up at your Bufferbox.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.840]   Well, it was a Canadian company and I guess the Bufferbox was only available in Toronto.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.040]   Well, Google is expanding their pilot to San Francisco and that's happening now.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.560]   And it looks pretty cool.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.520]   I'm not totally sure how different this is from just like having a private mailbox.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.960]   And I know that Amazon has like an Amazon locker service as well, which I think is kind
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   of a similar thing.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.840]   But the problem it's trying to solve is just like, hey, you're not home, you're at work
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.960]   and you had a package delivered, but this is a safe, secure place where a package can
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.520]   be delivered and you get a push notification when it has been.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.440]   Yeah, the difference between that and like a P.O. box or whatever is that it's, you don't,
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.160]   if you don't have a package, you don't have an empty box.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.880]   You just fit for the direction of when you have a package.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.600]   It's almost like putting your luggage at the train station and you take the key and then
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.080]   when you go back to get your luggage, you leave the key in there and somebody else uses
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   it later.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.680]   And Amazon's locker service, this is clearly a response to Amazon's locker service, is
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.080]   not doing so well.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.720]   I think the amount of a lot of 7-Elevens.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.240]   7-Eleven is one of the companies that's working with Bufferbox to try this, but it just seems
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.120]   like a kind of a funky business for Google to be in.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.720]   I just don't see this succeeding.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.880]   Having said that, there is an interesting trend that I wrote about last weekend of every
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:33.840]   test everything in San Francisco and including Google on other things, too, that Google's
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.320]   new delivery service, which just recently went into the Bay Area, started in San Francisco.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.760]   There's a long list of services you can only get in the city of San Francisco.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:50.360]   And this Bufferbox thing is when they tested another city, the second city of San Francisco.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:56.200]   San Francisco is always the first or the second city to get these cool services.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.640]   And if you add them up, you're like, "Wow, man, I'm moving to San Francisco.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.720]   This is some cool stuff."
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.240]   Having said that, this looks weird.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.200]   You know, there are a bunch of coffee shops and stuff.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.280]   Who wants to pick up a package and a coffee shop?
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.840]   Well, they also launched a local shopping delivery service in San Francisco as well.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.360]   So it sort of makes sense that these two things would be launched hand in hand.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.640]   Aaron, have you tried any of these services?
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.200]   And I guess Petaluma is not, you guys are a little far out.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.080]   Yeah, I'm too far from San Francisco to make use of this.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.440]   And it really doesn't appeal to me.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.000]   Maybe I'm not the target audience.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.720]   I guess it seems like what are they going to do above and beyond what the UPS store already
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.320]   does and things like that?
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.280]   I think what Mike said about maybe the time, more of a time share thing, where you only
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.000]   pay for the time that they're holding a package for you, that kind of makes sense.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.840]   They could compete in that angle.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.680]   But I don't know.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.320]   I mean, I was intrigued with the whole Amazon locker thing.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.880]   I thought that was interesting.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.320]   I guess I'm more interested in improving delivery services so that I can get things faster.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:13.000]   So if there's some way to use this and also get same day shipping to these locations or
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   something, I mean, that might be interesting, but I don't see that as being part of this.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   So.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   Right.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Yep.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Yep.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Let's see.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.280]   What else do we have going on here?
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280]   Ha.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.320]   This is relevant also when we move the 15th anniversary.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.160]   The Q survey says that 56% of internet users Google themselves.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.920]   See, I am excuse to Google myself often.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.680]   We do it almost every week on the show just to try out new features.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.520]   So it doesn't feel like too much of an ego of indulgence.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.480]   But yeah, that's more than half of adults.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.640]   This is an article that reports a search engine land.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.480]   And in fact, men search themselves 58% of the time, women 54% of the time.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.400]   And they've got also further breakdown by race and age.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.800]   Of course, the younger you are, the more likely you are to google yourself.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   Education and household income.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.200]   Kind of interesting.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.920]   I mean, I think that not unexpected.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.520]   I guess we all are concerned about what people are seeing when they try to find information
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.160]   about us.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.560]   And what information about us is out there.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.160]   I'll admit I had a Google alert set up for my name there for a while.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.000]   Like get an email whenever a new web page on the web showed up with my name in it.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.160]   It was usually stuff that maybe go like, oh.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:32.720]   But it was mostly useful.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.200]   I wonder if Google could offer more, again, going into the kind of social part of it.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.600]   If Google could offer more and better tools, and I guess Google+ really is the solution
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   to this for sort of creating your presence online and managing it and making it, putting
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.480]   yourself, putting the content out there that you want people to see.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.120]   And I guess that's exactly what Google+ really is.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.280]   Yeah, I mean, what you're talking about is reputation management.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.080]   And there are a couple of reasons to do that.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.480]   Like if you're a professional like us, and you're sort of in the public sphere in some
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.800]   way, you want to see if somebody's out there trashing you, if somebody's committing a libel
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:22.120]   or whatever, or if somebody's stealing your content or stealing your name, that's all
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.000]   good to know.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.880]   I think younger people are curious.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.440]   I mean, there are lots and lots of people who they search their name and there's nothing
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.680]   but a Facebook thumbnail picture of themselves.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.080]   And that's all they're going to find.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.760]   But when they do pop up, it's like pretty cool.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.400]   So it's the sign of the times and why not?
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.640]   I mean, you've mentioned Gina that you, as curious about this, that you had a Google
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   alert.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   Did you get rid of it?
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.720]   I did wind up getting rid of it at some point because it just, it wasn't, it didn't feel
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.800]   complete and it only came once in a while.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.280]   And I just, I kind of went through it in Boxbird where I was like just shutting down
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.440]   and you know, ran as many emails that came to me automatically as possible.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.480]   And I just felt like, you know what, this will, I'll find these things as they come
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.720]   up or people will tell me about them.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.720]   That's fine.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.000]   And it honestly did not feel complete.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.320]   Google alerts felt really good and timely and I would get, you know, big digest really
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.360]   often a couple of years ago, but it seems like it's kind of gone downhill.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.520]   I don't know if they're just not maintaining it enough or if it's just my searches weren't
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.320]   configured correctly.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.680]   Do you still use Google alerts?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.000]   I use it heavily.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.920]   I mean, I have, I have hundreds of alerts.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.640]   I have a special folder in Gmail to receive them all.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.240]   And once a day I try to slog through them.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:44.000]   I get, I get 150 or so a day or something on every imaginable topic.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.320]   I have too many.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   Like if I, what, what, what things I do is, is if I am introduced to a new concept and
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.960]   I want to learn more about that concept, I just set up, you know, just that word is related
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   to that concept.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.080]   I guess the most, one of the most recent ones is reshoring their companies that are like
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.560]   Apple that are bringing their manufacturing from China back to the US or whatever.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.760]   Kind of curious, is that a trend?
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   Is that not a trend?
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   So I'll set up an alert.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.680]   It'll throw me for a while and then I'll get sick of it and delete it.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.920]   So I'm very fluid with it.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.440]   I probably create alerts every single day and delete some every other day or something
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   like that.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.320]   And I certainly have the ego ones going, the ego searches going.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.800]   I find it phenomenally useful.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.280]   Also, my big tip that I give people about Google alerts is that there are also Google
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:39.680]   scholar, scholar alerts, which is an entirely separate system that searches, you know, it
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.600]   searches, you know, scientific journals and stuff like that.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.520]   So if you're interested in technology, so search engine technology, you want a Google
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.760]   alert searching the general press and then you want another one with the same keyword
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.560]   searching the scholarly press because there are a lot of papers that people are writing
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.040]   that are very instructive.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.720]   But I love Google alerts and I'm scared to death.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.200]   They're going to kill it someday.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.960]   Yeah, I wouldn't surprise me actually.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.800]   That might be a sad day for you.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   I've heard a whole lot about it in a while.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   I'm really, I'm really.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.120]   I'm really encouraged to see that this number of people Googling themselves.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.320]   And I think it's really important.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.480]   I mean, people might feel vain doing it like, I'm not going to Google myself.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.480]   That's so vain.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.480]   It really, you really should, especially if you're in the job market or looking for a
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.760]   job or, you know, people for employers, that's probably one of the first things they do is
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.480]   do a Google search on your name and you want to know what's coming up.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.520]   When I was looking for a job recently, I read a story about it.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.760]   This guy who there was someone with the same name as him who did some horrible things.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.680]   And he was wondering why he kept getting turned down for all these jobs.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.280]   And then he found out that there was this person with the same name that was doing all
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.680]   these crazy things and people were thinking it was him.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.120]   And he had a heck of a time trying to go through.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.840]   I think he eventually did hire one of the reputation online places to fix this.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.000]   I think they finally got it fixed.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.280]   But I mean, you know, this poor guy was searching for like over a year trying to find a job
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.080]   and he didn't realize this until later.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.720]   So I think it's in everyone's best interest whether you feel like you're like it's a
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.720]   good thing or not.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.440]   You definitely ought to go do it just to see what pops up because that's other people's
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.400]   view of you that may not know you very well.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.400]   And Google alert is an efficient way to do it because you don't have to go searching
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   every week or whatever.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.000]   You can just set it up and forget about it.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.120]   And then if you pop up somewhere, it'll show up in your inbox and you can see what people
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   are saying.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:40.960]   So I think the sense that they had some problems for a while and it's gotten better again.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.920]   But I could be completely wrong and I'd be curious of what the experience is of people
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.960]   listening or in the chatroom whether it's gotten better for them.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.280]   I get tons of stuff.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.560]   I don't know if it's comprehensive if there's things being missed or not.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.560]   And I'd really love to know whether it's really getting everything.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.480]   Yeah, Aaron's point.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.920]   Your point about Google yourself is I was kind of joking about feeling like I had an excuse.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.000]   It does feel made in a get testicle, but you are right.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.400]   It really is useful to see, you know, it's like walking out of the house in the morning
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.040]   without kind of looking in the mirror.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.760]   And it's sort of just a reality of today's world.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.520]   And especially for young people who are looking for jobs or applying to go into schools,
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.720]   plenty of potential employers and even even schools and stuff are looking at your, you
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.160]   know, what you look like online and pity the folks with common names who get confused.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:42.360]   Well, people should realize that nowadays companies hire external consultancies whose
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:48.400]   specialty is to find out everything there's about you to the point where they even friend
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:56.240]   you on Facebook or whatever they do and do deep research to find out everything there's
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.240]   about you.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.520]   They essentially profile you, label you, categorize you and then go back to the perspective
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.240]   employer and say, okay, this person falls into the following three unemployable categories
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.880]   of party animal, whatever.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:16.920]   And I mean, this is a very, very sophisticated new industry that's being raised recently
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   by companies.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.440]   And even those that are not going pro with the big specialized consultancies are doing
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   a version of that in house because it's simply so easy and so inexpensive to do.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:35.400]   So yeah, you really have to know what they know about you if you're looking for a job.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.400]   Yep.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   All right.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.680]   Well, next up, we're going to do the change log.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.840]   But before we get there, Leo has time traveled from the past to the future to the present
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.640]   to the, I don't know, he's time traveled to come say a word to us about our sponsor today,
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   Legal Zoom.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.640]   Hey, Jeff.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.120]   Hey, Gina, don't mind me.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.680]   I'm somewhere in the middle of the Adriatic, but I came back just to tell you legal zoom.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.840]   Dot com legal zoom is not a law firm, but I think they're better.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.960]   There's certain things legal things one needs to do in life, but you don't need to spend
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.600]   all that money on a lawyer for things like a last will and testament incorporating your
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]   business.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.400]   And LLC trademarks patents.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.880]   Legal Zoom can help you with these legal tasks at a much more affordable cost.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.200]   You get the feeling of control, which is great to effect.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.560]   This is how we did our LLC here way back in 2005.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.720]   And it was partly because I didn't want to spend the money.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   All right.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.060]   It was entirely because I didn't want to spend the money, but I do love the idea that
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.800]   I see the whole process.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.280]   I go through it step by step.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.920]   I answer the questions.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.000]   I think about it and I get the document I want.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.080]   I think there's a lot to be said for that.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.880]   There's a lot of pride with starting your own new business.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.320]   If you don't protect it, you're going to regret it.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320]   I can just say that.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.440]   You're at risk of losing it.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.640]   Worse if you get sued, you're at risk of losing your personal assets.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:06.800]   That's why you create an LLC or corporation to protect your personal assets to limit liability.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.120]   That's what stands for limited liability.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   So here's the deal.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.320]   I want you to protect yourself.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.360]   I want you to use legal zoom.com.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.880]   I want you to join the million business owners.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.920]   There's over a million business owners like me who have used legal zoom in the last 12
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.800]   years to help start their businesses.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   You'll save time.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.200]   You'll save a pile of money on startup costs.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.120]   And they don't mention this, but I really think the sense of control you get is great.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.600]   By the way, you can get legal advice from legal zoom.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   This is new.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   They didn't have this when I did it.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.040]   They have the legal zoom legal plan.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.160]   They've got contracted relationships with attorneys at almost every state.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.440]   You can see their profiles online, unedited customer reviews.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.740]   They're pre-negroshated fees, so you know exactly what you're going to pay.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.560]   So you can get an attorney to give you some answers.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.120]   Help you decide between an LLC or a chapter S or a chapter C, for instance, get a DBA.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.560]   You can even form a non-profit all just starting at $99 at legal zoom.com.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.520]   Wheels, trusts, trademarks.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.520]   I love legal zoom.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   I think you will too.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.680]   I really feel like they're a company that is empowering people like me to live their
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.680]   dream.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   And I think that's so great.

[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Google.

[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.880]   And as our thank you, we'll give you 10 bucks off.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.600]   How about that?

[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.840]   Use the offer code Twig.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.280]   Back we go to this week in Google.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.280]   And now, the changelog.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.560]   The Google changelog.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:54.440]   Oh, that just makes me so happy every single time.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.880]   So we got a few different nude things in the Googleverse this week in addition to some
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.800]   of the things we talked about earlier, Hummingbird and the Knowledge Graph changes.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.920]   Google's released a completely redesigned analytics app.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.720]   That's a Google Analytics app for Android.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.240]   It's got a totally redesigned look and feel.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.640]   Ideal for tablets and phones.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.400]   You can see that clean typography and the card design that we were seeing across all
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.200]   Google products.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.160]   Google Analytics for Android now is new visualizations that automatically resize to fit your screen
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   size and your orientation.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.080]   It's got a slide navigation that mirrors Google Analytics on the web.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.440]   Quick access to reports and specialized reporting for web and app views.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.240]   So if you're Google Analytics ad-act, you definitely want to get this update.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.160]   Google also launches web designer.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.200]   This is a visual tool for building interactive HTML5 sites and ads.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.720]   This is a desktop app for Mac and Windows.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.440]   And you can download it if you go to google.com/webdesigner and it's available right now.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.120]   Again, just Mac and Windows.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.960]   And I got really excited about this because I thought, oh, this is a web development tool
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.600]   where you can make websites that are super interactive HTML5.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.640]   And then as you can see in the demo that Chad is showing us, it's this really small part
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   of the web.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:15.160]   And it's actually, you can build sites with it, but it's actually built for making ads.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:22.680]   It was developed to allow advertisers to easily create HTML5 ads for mobile and desktop.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.040]   Until recently, Google argued advertisers didn't have the tools they needed to easily
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.440]   develop content fit for today's cross-screen experiences.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.120]   And web designer wants to be that tool.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.440]   You can also make whole sites with it, but you'll see in the demos, really, it's about
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.240]   making banner ads and the standard ads size was built right into it.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:48.040]   Google's reverse image search is now available in Chrome by default, no extension needed.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.560]   This is in Google Chrome 31 and above, I believe.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.760]   And I don't have it yet, but it's rolling out over the next few weeks.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.840]   You don't have to install intention to reverse image search.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.600]   You can right click on an image and there's an option in the menu now that says search
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.440]   Google for this image.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.520]   So you do reverse image search and basically it lets you see content that's related to
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   a specific image.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.720]   So if you search for picture of your favorite band, you see search results that include
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.320]   similar images of the band, web pages about the band, or even sites that include the
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.320]   same picture.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.960]   Of course, I call this the catfish feature.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.080]   Catfish is that show about people who get into online relationships and haven't met the
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.320]   other person and this other person usually looks like a supermodel.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.600]   And then they do reverse image search and realize that they've janked this image from
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.800]   somebody who's totally not them.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.200]   So now Chrome makes it a lot easier to do that.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   What else?
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.640]   Oh, Google's rolling out the streamlined new colorful new design for docs, sheets and
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   slides in Google Drive.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.280]   It's just kind of a minor update, but it does look really nice.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.880]   You'll see in the screenshot there.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.560]   And notice each editor has a product icon displayed in the header, kind of bright, right color.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.920]   And that doubles as a link back to all your files and drive.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.760]   And the header is more streamlined and compact and so you can focus more on your content.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   It looks nice.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   I can see it here in the rundown here.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.200]   We use sheets for the twig rundown.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.880]   And finally, what we talked about earlier, the new search engine and card UI for mobile
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.520]   search and the new iOS search app that we talked about earlier, the 15th, 15th birthday,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:28.800]   so that you get cross-device notifications and the knowledge graph comparisons and filters
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.440]   all rolling out now and hummingbird as well, which has been rolled out for quite some time.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.320]   So yeah, that's it.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.080]   That's all I got in the change log.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.480]   Hey, Janah, did you guys cover last week?
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.480]   Maybe I missed it.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.640]   But the inclusion of the new apps icon when you go to Chrome instead of having all your
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.400]   Chrome apps come up, you have the little apps button.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.400]   We didn't actually.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.280]   I think I mentioned it when it was in beta.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.600]   Chrome is one of those things because there's Canary and the-- it's Canary and the dev channel
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   and then beta.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.120]   I'm not even sure how many channels there are, but you can often kind of see new features
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.240]   coming from far away.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:16.200]   But yeah, that little apps button in the upper left-hand corner of Chrome, like right under
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   the back button.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   Right here.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   Yeah, right there.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   Chad's got my desktop.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.160]   So now, instead of having this, this was what used to come up.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.000]   When you open a new tab, it was like all your stuff.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.120]   You can see I'm a big old-time arcade guy.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.560]   But that's what used to come up and it was kind of like, blah.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.160]   Here's all your apps on the page.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.480]   And then I think what they decided to do now is, number one, they're bringing the Google
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.600]   search bar front and center, which is interesting.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.560]   And then, so you have the button for apps.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.920]   And then the other thing, well, it's even showing me over here on the other side, Chad, welcome
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.040]   to the new way to find your favorite Google products.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:55.600]   So you can open up the grid and it automatically drops down the things that I use most often,
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.080]   which is really helpful if I just want to click on Drive without going to a different
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   page.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.600]   I mean, it saves me a couple of clicks.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.960]   But throughout the day, that actually adds up to quite a bit of savings, time savings,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.960]   for me.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.640]   So I can go right to YouTube, I can go right to Google+, so they've changed that around
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   a little bit.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.720]   And I really like it.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.160]   The more I use it, at first I was like, I'm not sure, just because I was used to the
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.560]   old way of doing things.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.360]   And now it's like, wow, this makes so much sense.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.880]   Why didn't they do this years ago?
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   Because it really makes it more streamlined on the page, at least for me.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.040]   Yeah, I have to say, I did not mourn for the departure of the black bar.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.720]   I think they called it the sandbar across the top.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720]   It's much cleaner.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.000]   I like the white space a lot more.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.240]   That grid of little boxes in Chrome, when I first saw it, I was like, oh, hey, get out
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   of my Chrome.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.960]   And I think that Chrome is supposed to disappear.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.560]   The actual Chrome is supposed to disappear a little bit.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.760]   I've gotten used to it.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:53.080]   This very cohesive design is really-- and you mentioned this earlier, Aaron-- this is
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   page.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:59.880]   This is Larry Page coming in and saying, Google is going to have a consistent design that shows
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.680]   up across all the products.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.880]   And it's really nice to see that the cards and the good typography and the white space.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.240]   And now you see the hamburger icon a lot.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.320]   And now we're seeing this grid of the apps grid button.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.400]   It's these visual signals that you're like, oh, that's what that is.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.880]   And I can see that in all different contexts and still understand what it is.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.560]   So yeah, I really like it.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560]   I've accepted it.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.120]   I didn't love that I had a button added to my Chrome without adding it myself.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.880]   But I'm good with it.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.920]   Now that I can see them rolling it into the web products as well, I like it.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.920]   And they even have a new commercial.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.000]   I don't know if you've seen it that talks about Chrome.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.480]   It's a commercial for Chrome and it says mobile, tablet, TV, or mobile tablet laptop.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   I forget what it is.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.680]   But it's the same experience everywhere.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.120]   So they're really pushing for that.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.840]   And I think that's what this is all about, really making sure that the user interface
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.960]   is common across all the devices so that people feel comfortable using it the same way everywhere
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.760]   they interact with it.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   Yep, absolutely.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.280]   Yeah, that's a good commercial.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.480]   Definitely pushing us toward a multi-device world where you've got a computer and a tablet
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.360]   and a phone and everyone has a computer and a tablet and a phone and eventually a watch
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.120]   and glasses and that's totally normal.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.600]   And you're not dismissing notifications across all of them, which is nice.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.120]   Speaking of watches, the Galaxy gear reviews landed today.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:25.200]   I know this is a little far afield, but the Galaxy gear is getting some bad reviews out
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   there.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.760]   Yeah, it's horrible.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Have you tried it, Mike?
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.400]   Have you tried one?
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:40.280]   I haven't, but I wrote about it when they first announced it and essentially declared
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.840]   it dead in the water.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:49.120]   The whole point of the new version of the wearable computing movement is that suddenly
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.760]   wearable computing is wearable.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:56.960]   Watches and smart watches and cell phone watches and stuff have been around for a long time.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:02.240]   You could, 10, 12 years ago, you could buy a watch that could make phone calls and that
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.920]   could take pictures and all that stuff.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:10.720]   I had a camera watch in the year 2000.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   But they were horrible.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   They're huge.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.200]   There's like a TV set last year wrist.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.640]   They're just gigantic boxy, bulky thing.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:27.160]   Most women could never wear a watch like this except for ironically or as a geek fashion
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   statement.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:37.880]   They're just awful and so the promise of the new watch movement that you see with the fitness
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:44.320]   oriented watches and also the idea that Apple's working on a curved glass smart watch is that
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:50.760]   they're going to be actually, you can wear them in public and not be a complete dork.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:58.040]   And then a long-come Samsung with this throwback device that's just a gigantic boxy bulky
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:05.000]   ugly thing that is, I mean, it's just incomprehensible that they actually did this.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.440]   That only works with the Note 3 if you want to talk about the pocket.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   Yes, yes.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.680]   I mean, they're slowly rolling out compatibility with a few other phones.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.600]   But you know, it's like at the exactly, I mean, the very least support every phone that has
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   Bluetooth.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.760]   And then you know, you'll get more than a dozen users.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.600]   I mean, it's just, it's just an awful thing that they did.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.160]   And the thing that bothers me about it is I've been a huge cheerleader for the wearable
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.800]   computing movement in general and the smartwatch movement in particular.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.360]   And I've been saying, you know, it's coming.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.880]   It's going to be fantastic.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.120]   And then they come up with everybody saying this thing and the Qualcomm watch, which was
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.600]   not a serious effort either, they're acting like, okay, this is the smartwatch revolution
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.760]   that we've been talking about.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.600]   No, this isn't the revolution.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600]   This is not.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600]   This is not it.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.880]   It's the thing that we're going to bury with the revolution that hasn't actually started
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   yet.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.160]   So, so what's, what's Google going to, I mean, the rumor is Google's working on one of these
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.200]   watches too, right?
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.840]   So what do they, what do we think, I guess, or what do we think they're going to do differently
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.880]   that that's going to make it something that we can actually use and want to use?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   Google now.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   Certainly now.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.920]   I mean, I'm trying to imagine glass on my wrist.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.040]   My wrist would be really, really great, right?
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.120]   Because I wouldn't have the dorky thing on my head, but I would get all the sort of nice
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.840]   benefits of, of, of Google now kind of right there.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.520]   And so really, just Google now running on my phone or my wrist would be, would be.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.520]   It's got to, there's so many things that they'd have to hit.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.040]   They have to hit great battery life.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.960]   They had to hit wireless charging.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.360]   They have to not try to do everything, you know, kind of and do a few things really well.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.800]   I think that there are opportunities to market the watch to certain groups like building the
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.840]   fit watch makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:00.240]   Like fitness nuts, you know, parents who have to do things one handed a whole lot, you know,
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.400]   people who just, just kind of notification junkies or news junkies or people who want
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.920]   notifications without being, you know, had to be doing that rude thing when they have
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:06.920]   to pull out their phone.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.640]   They just have to articulate the message of what the product does really well.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.040]   And the product has to be like simple and just, you know, just be something that, you
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.640]   know, that communicates its value so much that you just can't bear not to have one.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.680]   And I think too, opening it up for developers more as well.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680]   Yes.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   Right.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.120]   I mean, that's got to be, that's got to be pretty big because it's not only about what
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.840]   Google can do, but you know, if you have the ecosystem and a developer is willing to spend
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.120]   the time to make an app that's really cool.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.040]   I mean, Google doesn't know everything about this.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.000]   Samsung doesn't know everything there is to know about this.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.160]   Sony doesn't know.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.320]   So I mean, I think having a functional developer ecosystem for a product like this will be
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320]   huge.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.520]   Well, with Android's rich like notifications, like Android has great rich notifications
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.080]   built in already like that iOS doesn't have, right?
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   So, so if, if say, for instance, at Google IO 2014, all the developers get watches and
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:04.320]   automatically your apps rich notifications appear on the watch and you're able to control
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.200]   your media or, or, you know, perform all the actions that you can perform in a rich
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.000]   notification right now, but do it on your watch, which isn't, isn't that, you know, difficult
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.360]   to imagine right because those rich notifications do have minimal UIs, but do you let you perform
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.440]   the most important actions, you know, with out with very little developer intervention,
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   that would be amazing.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.520]   So that would be a good start.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.640]   Like, hey, your apps notifications work perfectly on our, on our watches and when they're dismissed
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.320]   on the watch or dismissed across every other device, so users not going to be annoyed by
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.360]   them when they look at it, look at them and all their other devices, that'll be awesome.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.960]   But you know, if they also give away, every developer gets a smartwatch at Google IO
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.880]   2014, also here's the SDK and here are a couple of extra cool things that you can do with
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   it.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.160]   Here are the sensors that the watch has that none of your other Android devices have,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.720]   then you then you get no place where you're like, hey, I can install, you know, apps
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720]   for this.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:59.800]   So, so a couple of things about the smart about Google's potential smartwatch.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:04.640]   One of them is that I predicted and I hope that the prediction is true that the Google
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:11.280]   smartwatch will have the same aspect ratio as Google Glass so that the user interface
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.560]   and the apps and everything can be just the same.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:16.520]   Just as you said, Gina, it's, it's the same thing.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.880]   So for those not familiar with the Google Glass interface, it's, it's a breathtaking new
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.400]   idea for an interface.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.360]   When it comes on, you see the current time and that's the present.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.920]   And as you scroll to the right, you go further back into the past, everything that's happened,
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:38.400]   the event that's happened, every card that's happened in Google Glass in reverse chronological
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.400]   order.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.400]   And if you go to the left, it's the future.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.120]   It's the weather today and you know, and so on and that you get the very end on the
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.000]   left and you get saying, that's a perfect interface for wristwatch.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   Perfect.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.880]   And if they have the same aspect ratio, they can essentially just leverage everything that's
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.200]   been done with glass for the watch.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.400]   So okay, that's one point.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:04.880]   The other point about Google and a wristwatch is that the cool things about the Moto X phone,
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.640]   the coolest things about it are the sort of low power mode and the fact that it's always
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.480]   listening and always paying attention to location and orientation and movement and all that
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.120]   kind of stuff in the super low power mode.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.440]   That technology was developed for a wristwatch, not for a phone.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.880]   They developed that for the, for the Motorola smartwatch.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:34.040]   And so, you know, look at what Google already has to bring to a wristwatch.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.480]   They have the Moto X technology.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.440]   They have Google now and they have the Google Glass interface.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.520]   That's all I want.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.240]   That would be the greatest watch ever.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.520]   And in fact, one of the stories in our rundown there, there, Google is set to release the
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:54.360]   GDK, the glassware development kit to developers, which will let developers build native apps
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   for glass.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:00.800]   It's interesting if native apps for glass, if the glassware app store, which is also rumored
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.960]   or may have been confirmed to launch next year, if that would just all work on the watch
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:05.960]   as well.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:10.000]   There was the mirror API that they released early on, but it was limited.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.560]   So it looked like the GDK will really let developers do more or native stuff.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:18.080]   So it's interesting that they're calling it the GDK or the calling of glass.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.480]   Like if the plans were to extend it to the watch, I'd almost kind of expect them to call
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.880]   it like the wearable, you know, DK or something instead of the GDK.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.960]   But there's definitely a lot of potential there.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.480]   It does seem like Google's really positioned to do a watch well just because they've done
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.040]   the DUI on glass, I have to say social, you know, all the other kind of blockers aside,
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.080]   the UI, the user interface is absolutely perfect.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.400]   They nailed that better than I thought you could do.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.000]   I had my doubts about how I keep navigating on glass, but it's really quite good.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   I agree.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.360]   Speaking of glass, I love this video.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.120]   They're a firefighter had entered the if I had glass social contest, social media contest
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:07.080]   and proposed that he would use glass to take pictures and take videos while fighting fires.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.520]   And he just got his pair.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.440]   And I think just last week, and I think this past weekend, he fought his first house fire
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:19.200]   using glass and he said, you know, I'm concerned about the heat and the smoke affecting the,
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.120]   you know, the hardware.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.760]   But he got some amazing pictures.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.440]   And you really can see how particularly for something, a specialized job like firefighting
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.800]   or security, how glass is really kind of amazing to be able to take hands free photos
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   and video.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.960]   Yeah, Chad, you've got the video going there.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.720]   I don't know if you can get sound on that.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.400]   This video had an actual blaze.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   It just handed me the novel.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.360]   I was like, what are you doing?
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   He's going to run over me.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.840]   This is my visor on my helmet.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.440]   It's just quick and easy to catch the picture.
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.600]   He would receive Google Glass on a Friday.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.680]   By Sunday, he was fighting a house fire.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.120]   This is just a decent fire.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.640]   Straight for straight, right there.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.840]   They'll come over here.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.000]   Of course, his plan has an inherent risk.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.640]   Will the technology be reliable?
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.000]   My biggest concern is the heat and the smoke.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.680]   He believes Google will take notes and make adjustments for Glass's 2014 release.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:17.800]   I think the glass that we have today is going to be different than the glass that comes
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.720]   out as a consumer model next year.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:23.040]   The way Chief Wood sees it, this tool could stand the test of time.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.400]   You can take a picture, send a picture, make a phone call.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.640]   I think it's the next step in the information revolution.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.640]   In Jones County.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.640]   Hmm.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.640]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.640]   Pretty cool.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.720]   I've had my doubts about Glass as a general consumer product.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:43.480]   I think for firefighters and surgeons and teachers and field guide leaders and those kinds
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:49.040]   of specialized factory workers, anything to do with safety or education.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:55.360]   I think there's huge potential there that certainly trumps the maybe discomfort of having head
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360]   mounted camera on your face.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.120]   Yeah, because you can't interact with it.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.240]   A lot of those, I know I have a friend who's a firefighter and he uses a GoPro that he puts
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.040]   on his helmet.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.520]   You can't interact with that.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.000]   You can capture for later use, but you can't interact right away and say, take this picture,
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.520]   swipe, send it to whatever, the Chief or whoever's monitoring the situation.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.840]   It's so much more useful.
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.520]   I can see this, Google taking this one step further and integrating it into helmets and
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   things.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Why wouldn't you do that?
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   Right?
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.280]   Or for police officers integrating it into their uniform somehow so that you can have
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   instantaneous feedback to somebody that's making decisions that needs a closer look at the
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.280]   situation.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.080]   Yep, absolutely.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.480]   Very cool.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:48.880]   Did you accidentally hang out someone who you were not trying to hang out with?
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.680]   Do you see the story?
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.440]   No, just Google Hangouts/Gtalk.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:58.640]   So on any of your devices, I guess apparently there was a glitch that sent some chat messages
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.880]   to the wrong recipients, which is basically the worst bug that you can possibly have
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.000]   in an IAM client.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.480]   This actually happened to me.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.840]   Oh, Chad, this happened to you?
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.120]   So here's the bug.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.720]   For me, it still sent a message to someone who was in my circles.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.160]   But if I sent a message to someone who I expected, it would only go to them.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.520]   It actually went to a hangout full of people.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.240]   Luckily, it was just like, "Hey, you there?"
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.760]   And people were like, "No, I'm not."
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.440]   Like, "What are you talking about?"
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.400]   And yeah, really scary to the point of like, "Okay, I'm going to use Skype for the next
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.600]   few days to contact everyone."
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.040]   Yeah, yeah, not fun.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.320]   So how did you realize that it went to a hangout full of people?
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.800]   Did a bunch of people respond?
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.800]   Like, who are you?
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]   What?
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.840]   Basically, and it would show up if you could see it.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:58.720]   It was a weird bug where I used Trillion.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.080]   And so I sent it through Trillion.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:06.560]   And then when I went to Google+, I could see that there was a hangout that I had spoken
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.320]   in, and I realized that the messages that I thought were going to the other friend were
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.480]   going to the hangout and not to the friend that I was messaging with.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.280]   Oh, weird Twilight Zone.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280]   That would have freaked me out.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.320]   I'm going to use a word that I would never use with Jeff Jarvis on the show, which is
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.320]   that creepy.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   Totally creepy.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.760]   And can you imagine if I thought that I was talking to a family member and was maybe talking
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.480]   about family issues?
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:38.800]   I mean, there's so much that could go wrong that there's so many awkward things that
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   could happen.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.000]   I'm really glad that it was an innocuous message.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   Hey, how are you doing?
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000]   Are you there?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   And I'm impressed that you saw it.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   Like, I don't know.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   If you were on Trillion, so you just happened to check.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.160]   No, no, no, it's funny because I saw the article and I went, my friend never responded
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.560]   and went over to Google+.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.560]   Yes.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   Yes.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.920]   So luckily I was, I was pretty, I mean, I was a pretty savvy user and I caught it really
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.920]   fast.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:15.000]   And I knew exactly where to look to see if I was exhibiting the issues, but yeah, not
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.480]   fun, not fun.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.480]   Wow.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.440]   I got to say, I love Hangouts and I've actually switched to the Hangouts app on my Android
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.200]   phone and I use it on the desktop.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.400]   I mostly use the text, you know, the text chat.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.520]   I'll talk about the text versus the video chat.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.720]   And I really, I really like it a lot, but that is, that's a little scary.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:39.400]   Apparently there's Hangouts update rolling out, by the way, which will show availability
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.160]   statuses, a better organized contact list.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.880]   And I'm not sure if that has actually been pushed out yet.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.080]   I think Android police listed a link to the, to the APK.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.480]   I think it's a different process of being charged out.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480]   Stayed roll out.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.080]   But they need to, they need to, there's a lot that needs to happen with Hangouts is
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.640]   it's confusing to use.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   It's hard to tell what's going on and who's, you know, it's, it's constantly interrupting
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   people.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.160]   But I think the most glaring problem with Hangouts is support SMS yet.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160]   Yep.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.520]   It's kind of support SMS before anybody can really take it seriously.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.280]   I'm waiting for the day, the day when the Google voice Hangouts integration gets announced.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.640]   And also the weirdness about the way that it interacts with Google talk with, with different
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.880]   clients and the XMPP decisions that they made.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.120]   I mean, there were some, there were some missteps there.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:36.120]   I feel like it just, it needs to talk to every, you know, to everything, interact with everything,
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.600]   but particularly with SMS, right?
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.800]   Because SMS, that's what I message has over Hangouts at this point, right?
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.960]   That is the, is the SMS integration.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.520]   So that's definitely a big deal.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.080]   I almost wish they would have waited on this one.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.240]   I mean, they should have just held back until that stuff was working and they had the integration
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240]   with voice.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.880]   They had the integration, certainly with SMS.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.800]   I mean, it just seems like they should have waited just a little bit because now they've
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.120]   introduced confusion.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.120]   Do I use G talk?
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   Do I use Hangouts?
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   Do I use voice?
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.120]   I don't know.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:05.720]   Maybe I just use my phones, built in SMS because that's what works.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:09.760]   You know, and so I think it's going to be a lot harder for them now to, to get people
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.040]   to, to, to upgrade or I don't know if it's an upgrade, but change to Hangouts, which is
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   what they want.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.600]   Because they want to unify all this messaging, which is great, but they're just going to
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.080]   have a hard time doing that now because now people are confused.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.720]   It would have been so much better if they just would have waited six months or something
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.280]   until they were ready, hopefully, and released it at that time.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.640]   But the other problem is, and I don't know if this happens to you guys, but there's an
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:39.400]   incoming call or some kind of Hangout or something and you can't find it.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.400]   Does that happen to you?
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   Yeah, I've had that before.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:48.120]   If I go to Gmail, maybe it'll appear, you know, and it's just, it's just so half-assed.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.120]   It's just awful.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.280]   I did get a notification of one, which I, a man's red phone, which I swiped away and
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.240]   then couldn't find it, the new one.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.300]   And now I have this lingering paranoia of like, did I miss one or was it just a, a
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.300]   double notification?
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.300]   No, you're right.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.300]   You're right.
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.300]   I have been using it.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.240]   I do like it, but definitely, definitely does have, have some issues to work out for
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240]   sure.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240]   Yep.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240]   Um, let's see.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.720]   Do you guys see Steve Ballmer's, um, tearful goodbye?
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720]   It was intense.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.120]   He used to be crying, man.
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:30.760]   Mike, you did a piece about, uh, um, why, why Microsoft should fire Bill Gates, actually.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   Yes.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.360]   Well, there, there's a, there are three investors, uh, this, uh, Reuters, uh, reported this
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:44.400]   yesterday who are calling for Bill Gates to be removed as chairman, but left on the board.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:49.960]   Uh, and, um, they're especially concerned with his influence over the next CEO.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.080]   So they don't want to Gates to bring in another bomber.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:40:02.600]   I mean, essentially, bomber, uh, in my view was a, a, a conspicuously, um, uh, incompetent
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   CEO.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.480]   Um, I was going to use this information as my, um, number of the week later on, but,
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.840]   but the number, I, uh, yeah, no, no, no, that's fine.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.440]   Cause I also have a pick of the week, which I can use in that segment, but, but here's
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.640]   the number, $570 billion.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.720]   If you, uh, if you look at the evaluation of Microsoft when Steve Ballmer became CEO
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.640]   in the year 2000, it was roughly $620 billion and it was close to a record, the record that
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.640]   they had achieved.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:35.520]   Um, when you adjust that for inflation, that that would be about $850 billion.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:42.960]   So adjusted for inflation, Microsoft was worth $850 billion in 1999, 2000.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.360]   And it's now worth 280 billion.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:53.480]   So essentially under Steve Ballmer's, uh, leadership and it's really Bill Gates's leadership, uh,
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.880]   Microsoft has lost $570 billion in value.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.240]   So if anybody can think of a CEO who survived that long with that much loss of value, I'd
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.720]   love to hear it cause it's never happened.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:13.400]   And I've always believed that Steve Ballmer, um, the reason he was promoted to CEO and the
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:19.160]   reason he survived all his failures was because he was Bill Gates's guy.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:25.720]   He was loyal personally to his former college buddy, Bill Gates.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:29.760]   And so Bill Gates, everybody says Bill Gates is a genius and a visionary.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.080]   And there's another argument that he's a moral person because he's saved a lot of lives
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:36.600]   with this philanthropic organization to build a Melinda Gates foundation.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.000]   And that's a separate issue.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.560]   But if you just look at the, at the, at the ability for Microsoft to succeed in the future,
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:51.360]   and you look at the litany of failures that the, uh, you know, the, the sort of Steve Ballmer,
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:59.600]   Bill Gates duo has, has committed missing the internet in every possible way, missing search
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:06.120]   engines, failing with MSN, um, screwing up, uh, internet, their lead with internet explore.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:11.760]   If you look at the failures in mobile with the windows for pens and the origami project
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:18.440]   and, um, and, and the, and the whole tablet PC concept and every, you know, the internet
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.440]   and mobile is everything that's been happening since Ballmer has been in charge and they've
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.880]   not had a single success.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.480]   Everything that they've done that's been good, like the zoom or like the surface has
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.200]   been way too late for them to succeed with his phone.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:38.600]   So they're either wrong or they're late on everything's in the last 14 years.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:45.840]   And so to, to swap out Ballmer for another Bill Gates pick, another Bill Gates loyalist
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.400]   and to have Bill Gates even on the board, even his not chairman, he has enormous influence
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.760]   as far beyond his ownership.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.600]   He only owns 4.5% of Microsoft.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.680]   And by the year 2018, he's going to own zero.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:03.440]   He's got a staged automatic withdraw, essentially of sales of stock that will leave him with
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.240]   zero Microsoft stock in the year 2018.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.080]   These three investors who are calling for him to be removed as chairman, just them alone
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.600]   represent a greater percentage of stock than Bill Gates.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.720]   So this guy Bill Gates is essentially not a visionary.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.200]   He's a dinosaur and he's the wrong guy to be so influential over Microsoft.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.640]   Microsoft does so much potential, but they're unable to take their brilliant research and
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640]   put it into products.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:30.720]   They're unable to foresee things coming.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.680]   And they need a CEO who's really in charge of the company, who really has vision.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:44.080]   And if Bill Gates is anywhere near the board, he's going to have used his influence to continue
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:52.320]   in my, I would predict this long, long string of abject failures and the evaluation of Microsoft
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.800]   is going to decline and decline and decline until they're just a footnote in history.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.720]   And so I think Bill Gates should be kicked off the bull.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.720]   Wow.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720]   Wow.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.040]   That's, I like that.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.040]   That's good opinion.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.840]   We got, we got Mike calling the end of Facebook and Microsoft here, folks.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.680]   I think I'm going to put him around here in my calendar and I'll check in in a couple
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.240]   of years and see if this actually happens.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:14.240]   Love it.
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.240]   I love that.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.240]   It's good reasoning.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.240]   But is it really, I mean, is it really Bill Gates?
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.000]   I mean, every time I hear Bill Gates talk, in fact more, the more I hear him talk as he
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.520]   gets older, it seems like he still has a lot of these good ideas.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.480]   But you know, he resigned from his position.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.960]   I know he's still on the board, but I'm wondering if really, bomber wasn't in the way.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.080]   I mean, I mean, do you think that it really was, you think that getting rid of Gates really
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.240]   is the right decision or maybe now that bomber's gone, some of those really good ideas that
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.040]   Bill Gates maybe still has could actually be carried out.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:52.480]   Bill Gates is very good with technology and business, but he has absolutely no feel for
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.120]   human nature.
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:59.560]   And so he's tone deaf when it comes to users, when it comes to markets, when it comes to
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.280]   culture.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.080]   And so he is kind of, in my view, the opposite of Steve Jobs.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.280]   Steve Jobs was never super technical, was never a software developer or hardware engineer,
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:17.000]   but really had an instinct for what would thrill users.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.280]   And since 1999 when Steve Jobs, I mean, 1999 is the pivotal year when those two come to
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.120]   opposite directions.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:32.560]   And Steve Jobs keen insight into human nature without a lot of technical acumen.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.000]   And Bill Gates had all the technical background without just tone deaf about, you know, let
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   me give you one example.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.240]   I think you guys even talked about it recently on Twitter or maybe last week's Twig or something
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.240]   like that.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:53.760]   But the continued, if you look at the tiers of Windows, the different types and all this
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:59.080]   because they was picked out at sort of Vista, to not understand that that is just a horrible,
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:06.400]   unnecessary waste of consumer goodwill to just confuse the pants off of your customers
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.360]   and generate this sort of buyers or more.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:15.520]   But back to your point, I actually think Bill Gates was a, you can't argue with the fact
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:20.440]   that Mike stuff succeeded when Bill Gates was the CEO.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.960]   And I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he was a tyrant, like Steve Jobs.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:30.800]   He knew how to dress somebody down, how to instill fear and how to kick everybody's butt.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:40.800]   And he was a hardcore alcoholic, totally engaged in making, as a board member, he's just his
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.880]   ideas and his influence.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.880]   He's not engaged.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.440]   He's not able to instill fear and loyalty and all this kind of stuff that he could as
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.520]   CEO.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.640]   And so he's more of a problem or a barrier, I think, to Microsoft's success.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:05.800]   I mean, I really, if anybody thinks that Steve Ballmer ran Microsoft in a way that was counter
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:10.360]   to what Bill Gates wanted, I would be really surprised by that opinion.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.520]   He was a Bill Gates loyalist all the way.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.080]   And he was essentially running Microsoft on behalf of Bill Gates and largely guided by
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.480]   Bill Gates.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.520]   And between the two of these guys, they just missed everything.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.160]   And it's really unfortunate.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.760]   Microsoft has enormous potential.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:37.080]   The technology and the market position they have with Xbox, the fact that they own both
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:43.520]   PixelSense and also Perceptive Pixel, that's the future of desktop computing is touch.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:47.880]   And Microsoft owns most of the intellectual property and they have the biggest lead.
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.920]   And they're on track again to completely squander their lead.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:57.560]   They need a visionary who's going to get this stuff to market and be a lot more Google-like
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:03.160]   by just getting this stuff to market and being more transparent as a company and stop,
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.040]   they need to stop fighting internally and having these sort of silification and this
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.720]   kind of like internal competition.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:15.120]   And they need to scrap all that stuff and just move forward and be aggressive.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.560]   And I know with Bill Gates, I just don't see how they can do it.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.640]   Maybe they're not, maybe they're too big to do that though.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:30.280]   I can't see a company that big being able to spit stuff out that quickly and not have
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   the competition.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.160]   I mean, I worked at Oracle for a number of years and it was similar there, right?
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.960]   You've got all this internal competition and infighting and things.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.000]   You've got different groups that are trying to gain mindshare and everything's being
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.520]   run by the top, I Larry Ellison.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.680]   I think with Microsoft, it's kind of a similar problem right now as they're so big.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.760]   They've got their hands in so many pies.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:55.840]   It's hard to really deliver like you're saying, like they should with something that's really
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.400]   innovative and really bring something to market before other people.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.160]   I think that there's so many barriers in the way, not just with leadership, but with the
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.680]   size of the company and the different groups.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.560]   Like you say, I think it's going to be really hard for them to actually deliver on that
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:14.960]   with if they are going to continue to be a big monolithic company like they are now.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:19.280]   Yeah, I mean, that could be, but what would Larry do?
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:26.840]   I mean, if they're too big to succeed, then you need to cut a lot of underperforming.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:32.360]   What Microsoft has been doing all these years is instead of cutting underperforming properties
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:37.360]   as Google has been doing, they've been hiding the lack of performance through accounting
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.320]   gimmicks.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.800]   How much is being losing?
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:45.880]   Well, that's hard to determine because they've buried that in these other divisions and so
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.880]   on.
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:53.640]   That's sort of an internal political, ask-covering kind of approach to these problems that's
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:00.080]   very antiquated and is not going to help you compete against the likes of Apple and Google
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.920]   on the internet and in mobile technology and in the gadgets fair in general.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.880]   I don't think Microsoft needs to be smaller in order to do what they need to do.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.160]   What they really need to do is they need to use what remaining power and cash that they
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:17.840]   have to go and school Hollywood in who's in charge.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:23.240]   They need to turn Xbox into the living room system and turn that into home automation
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.240]   and all this stuff.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:27.120]   They've got everything in place they need to execute on it.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:31.320]   The other thing that they need to do is take this PixelSense stuff and the perceptive Pixel
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.600]   stuff, the big desktop touch tablet things and also pan in Microsoft's case, they have
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.880]   great research on pan combining touch and pan together and they need to get that into
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:46.760]   a sub $5,000 consumer version as fast as possible and really own that market because
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:50.320]   if they don't do it, Apple's going to do it and if Apple doesn't do it, Google's going
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.520]   to do it.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:58.280]   As it is now, Microsoft is years ahead but they're not shipping anything.
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.400]   They keep in it as for casinos and CNN for election night coverage.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.200]   That's what they're using this stuff for, small potatoes.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:11.720]   They need to ship this thing, they need to have this thing at best buy and if they can't
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:19.800]   turn that around in 12 months, they're going to repeat what they did with Zoom and with
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:25.360]   Surface, they're going to come with too little too late and it's going to be another lost
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360]   opportunity.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:31.040]   Maybe they need to spin up a skunkworks project or something similar to what Google's done
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:38.000]   with Xlabs and then from my own experience, what Sun did with when ZFS started to become
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.560]   hot and heavy, they took these guys and they said, "Hey, look, we got this new ZFS thing,
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.440]   we've got this D-Trace thing in Solaris.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.120]   Why don't you D-Trace guys go off to San Francisco and get aloft somewhere, come up
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:53.280]   with something new and cool and they came up with this great product for a while that
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.640]   was really catching on.
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.960]   It was really innovative at the time and I won't comment on where it is now because
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:05.160]   of where I work but it was the concept of taking something like this where you have
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.560]   a lead and then because of your size, you need to pare down and get focused on it, turn
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.280]   it over to a skunkworks project.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.880]   That's what seems to make the most sense here.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:15.400]   Why wouldn't they do that?
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.960]   Well, I don't know.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.160]   The research itself is something that Microsoft is very, very good at.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.720]   They have killer research but then when it's time to productize that research, the internal
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:31.240]   political divisions prevent them because nobody wants to compete against another division.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.720]   What they're starting to do, they're just now starting to do jump on board to what Google
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.520]   started which is that you compete with your partners.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.920]   Google was the first major company to say, "Hey, our whole mobile operating system depends
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920]   on these other companies making hardware.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:45.920]   There are our partners.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.680]   We do the software, they do the hardware."
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.400]   Then they bought Motorola and said, "You know what?
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:55.400]   We're going to compete directly against our partners, our users, the companies that
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.400]   sell this thing."
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.400]   Everybody's like, "You can't do that."
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.920]   And Google's like, "Watch us.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:00.920]   We're going to do it."
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:01.920]   Now, they're doing that.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.680]   Now, Microsoft's doing that.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.400]   They're a purchase of Nokia and all that stuff but they really need to embrace that concept.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.960]   They need to stop being afraid to cannibalize themselves and their partners and just move
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:16.400]   forward with the most bleeding end technology.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.880]   It's a cultural issue.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.520]   It's not about invention.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.640]   I don't think it's about execution.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:32.120]   It's about politics and it's about internal, the internal folk that needs to be completely
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:38.120]   undermined by strong leadership that just drives the best technology out into the market
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.040]   no matter who gets hurt.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.440]   That's what Google would do and that's what Microsoft needs to do.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.520]   Wow, fantastic discussion.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.520]   Good stuff.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.960]   One of the hardest things to do is change culture inside such a big company and you do
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.120]   need strong leadership to do it.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.840]   But yeah, great, Mike.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:55.840]   Thank you.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:56.840]   Cool.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:59.880]   So I think we should start to wrap up.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.800]   If you guys have any other stories you want to talk about, we'll take a break right now
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.280]   for Leah to tell us about Squarespace, our second sponsor today.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.640]   And then we'll move on to our picks.
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:13.200]   Hello, Googlers.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.200]   Leo Leport here.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:16.800]   Actually, I'm not here.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:25.280]   But thanks to the miracle of technology, I can be here in this form, this evanescent form
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.800]   to talk about squarespace.com.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:29.880]   I see so many people.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:37.240]   I see people like Jeff and Gina and lots of other people struggling with their websites.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.240]   We do it all the time.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:41.080]   We'll go to a website, knock it off the air.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.880]   And I think, you know, that's kind of a shame.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.680]   I mean, you're getting the biggest plug of your life sometimes.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:51.040]   And because we know that because so many people are going to your site, it's gone down.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:54.840]   So all those people who would see what you're doing can't.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.480]   That never happens with Squarespace.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.480]   We have tried.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.880]   In fact, try right now.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.040]   Go to our Squarespace site.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:05.160]   The inside Twitch blog is running on Squarespace.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.160]   Inside that Twitch.tv.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.800]   Can't bring it down.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.800]   Every one of you goes there.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:09.800]   All at once.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:10.800]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.800]   Nope.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.760]   That's because Squarespace does both hosting and the content management system.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.400]   They're tightly integrated.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.160]   Anthony explained this to me once.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.200]   And I know, you know, the founder Squarespace.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.360]   Anthony Castellaini explained this.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:30.720]   It has to do with the servers are virtualized and the software allows that.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:33.080]   And so your site doesn't just live on one computer.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.320]   It lives on the whole Squarespace cloud.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.640]   When more bandwidth is needed, the cloud is there to, you know, put more bandwidth behind
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.000]   your site completely seamlessly.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.720]   Stuff like that.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720]   I don't understand it.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.720]   I just know it works.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.320]   I know we cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.560]   But more than that, I mean, it's very affordable.
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.520]   It starts at $8 a month for the annual plan.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.560]   The unlimited plan is only 16 bucks a month.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:01.760]   That means unlimited bandwidth, unlimited sites, unlimited pages.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.920]   In fact, a Squarespace, you cannot, you will never get a bill with the unlimited plan for
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.920]   bandwidth.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.360]   So you get to be, you're the most popular site in the world.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.640]   Your site doesn't go down and you don't get a bandwidth bill.
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:18.200]   If you want to do commerce, 24 bucks a month with the annual plan, by the way, with any
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.680]   of these annual plans, they'll hook up your site.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.640]   They'll give you a custom domain name for free and they'll hook up your site.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.000]   The commerce is amazing.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.400]   If you want to sell something online, there is no better deal for ecommerce and squarespace.com.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.520]   Unlimited physical or digital goods, you can sell MP3s and CDs, for instance, or paintings
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.320]   and photographs or digital photography, whatever.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.520]   They calculate taxes, shipping.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.760]   You could do coupon codes.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:43.760]   All of this is built in.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.720]   They set you up with a merchant account.
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.800]   But Squarespace takes nothing.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.680]   24 bucks a month.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.920]   That's it.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.520]   I don't know of a better solution for ecommerce, frankly.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.720]   I think this is the best out there.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:56.720]   Every site is mobile ready.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:00.160]   So that means your store works mobile as well as desktop.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.520]   Look, you got to try it.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.520]   It's free.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.160]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.360]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360]   You can see all the templates.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.400]   Start designing and port all your content or create a new site.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.960]   And then if you decide to buy after the two weeks, you don't need to give them a credit
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:13.960]   card when you want to try it.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.120]   So you can walk away.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.760]   But if you decide to buy, just please use twig 10 as the offer code.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.440]   TWIG in the number one zero.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.440]   And you get 10% off.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.440]   Kind of just our way of saying thank you for showing your support for this week in Google
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.440]   and squarespace.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.880]   Squarespace.com.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:35.600]   When you decide to buy, use the offer code twig 10 to save 10%.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.480]   Back we go to Jeff Gina and this weekend.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.480]   Hoogle.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.480]   Hoogle.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.680]   Before we move on to our picks.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:45.640]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:50.480]   Are there any other stories that you guys want to cover before we go on to our picks?
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:56.600]   You know, I saw this thing about the vending machine, the game vending machine that Google
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   put in Japan.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:03.760]   Because this is Android based or it's an Android game vending machine.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.760]   So how does it work?
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.760]   So it works with NFC.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:09.960]   I guess you just go to the machine and like hold your phone up to the game that you want
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.400]   to load and like automatically loads.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.200]   But I think this only works in Japan.
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.080]   I can't see how this would work anywhere else, right?
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.480]   Because Japan, if you don't know, I mean, they've got a lot of vending machines there.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:20.480]   So they're all over the place.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.680]   You can buy all sorts of stuff through vending machines.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:24.960]   And I guess the concept is you just come up with your phone.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.320]   It has to be Android 4.0 and you have to have NFC and you might see a game or something
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.480]   that you want to load on your phone.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.000]   And so you just hold it up there.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.160]   And if it's a game that if it's a pay service, you know, it uses, I think it uses Google
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:42.000]   Wallet to pay or maybe you can use a credit card too.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.320]   I didn't see that in the article.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.880]   But I don't know.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.240]   It's just a really interesting concept.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.520]   I just cannot imagine this.
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.920]   I mean, why wouldn't you just use the phone?
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.920]   Right.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.320]   So it's a software vending machine.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:57.480]   So it's like the Play Store, it's a manifestation of the Play Store.
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:00.840]   Actually, the vending machine will give you a Nexus 4 for you to try it out.
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.840]   But you have to give the Nexus 4 back.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:05.520]   So this is interesting.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:08.840]   So if you just want to play a game, you could just be like, hey, give me a Nexus 4, load
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:12.040]   up a couple of games and play for a bit.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.920]   And then just give it back, like renting an Android phone.
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.120]   Oh, that makes more sense.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:17.120]   It looks a little more sense.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.280]   I missed that part of the article.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.600]   So it drops out of Nexus 4 and they use it.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.680]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.760]   Maybe it doesn't make sense.
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.280]   So they're hoping it's kind of like the Redbox idea, right?
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.960]   Like you go up and pick a movie.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.960]   It spits out a disc.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.280]   But in this case, it's spitting out a Nexus 4.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.360]   Yeah, is this at an airport?
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.280]   It seems like this would make sense at an airport.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.320]   I guess you wouldn't take it on the plane with you.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.320]   Right.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:42.320]   You have to get the phone back.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:48.400]   It says the machines are-- they're only there for a limited 10-day run.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.200]   So they're testing this concept out.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.000]   But I just can't imagine this working anywhere else.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.200]   It's just kind of an interesting story.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.600]   I thought I'd bring it up.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.440]   Yeah, yeah, cool.
[01:59:56.440 --> 02:00:01.240]   All right, let's move on to our picks.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.600]   Aaron, why don't we start with you?
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.280]   We've got something really interesting going on in the studio there.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:10.200]   I've been chomping at the bit to see what's going on in that extra monitor.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.200]   Right.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.840]   I don't know if you guys have heard about this project.
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:15.000]   It came out a couple weeks ago.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.080]   It's called Google Coder.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:22.400]   And what it is, actually, Google is kind of embracing Raspberry Pi.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.520]   Everything around this is right up my alley.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:30.520]   So I'm big into Google, big into open source, big into open hardware, which is why I love
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.600]   the Raspberry Pi.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:36.880]   And what you may not know is I also really love new concepts around education, right?
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.800]   So things like Udacity and different ways for people to learn and easier ways for people
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.160]   to learn about things.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:50.640]   So what Google did was they created this Google Coder, which is basically their learning
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.400]   environment for people that want to learn how to develop web applications.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.000]   So what you do is you take your Raspberry Pi.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.040]   And I've got my Raspberry Pi sitting here at the desk next to me.
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.360]   I don't know if we have a shot of that, Chad.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.360]   Oh, you can kind of see it.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.200]   I don't want to mess it up, but it's right here.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.200]   So I got my Raspberry Pi.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:09.440]   I've got a Wi-Fi dongle connected to it.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:15.200]   And I've got the Google Coder image loaded on the SD card that's in the Raspberry Pi.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:20.920]   And when you boot this up, and I will switch to my browser now, when you boot this up,
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:29.360]   if you're running Mac or Linux, you should be able to automatically go to coder.local.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.720]   And it should connect you automatically to the Raspberry Pi.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.680]   If it doesn't, if you're like me and you're running Windows so that I can share my screen
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:39.320]   better, you actually need to find out the IP address.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.840]   Anyway, so this is the first use.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.240]   So it's telling me we need a password.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.240]   So I'm just going to try this.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.240]   It's going to be a live demo.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.240]   Let's just see how this works.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.240]   I'm just going to put--
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.240]   I'm just going to put--
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.240]   They always go smoothly.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.320]   So I'm going to put a password in here.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:56.000]   Oh, and it's telling me it needs to contain a lower case and at least two uppercase letters
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000]   or numbers.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   Wow.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000]   Okay.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.440]   Let me modify this and see if it works now.
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.440]   Okay.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440]   I'm waiting.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440]   Here it comes.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]   Okay.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.480]   So now it says enter your password to get coding.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.360]   Hopefully I can remember what it is.
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:16.360]   So I'll put that on there.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:17.720]   And here's what you get.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:20.640]   So it's really Googly number one.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.720]   You can see the things that are popping up.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:23.720]   It kind of gives you--
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:24.720]   Click here to do this.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:25.720]   You create a new app.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:26.720]   Click here to do this.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.800]   The brilliant thing about this is, is it's very low cost.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.960]   So I'm running this on my $25 Raspberry Pi.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.840]   So basically for less than $50, you can get everything you need to get started coding
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.480]   web apps.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.640]   So let's just try this out.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.760]   Let's go ahead and say we want to test--
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.040]   They've got some preloaded apps here so we could do eyeball.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.120]   We'll click on eyeball.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.320]   And you can see the eyeballs moving around when I move my cursor around.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:51.920]   And the great thing about this is there's a little--
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.360]   It's probably hard to see on the thing, but there's a little tab over here on the side.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:07.120]   But if we click on that through the magic of television, it's taking a while to load.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.160]   But basically what happens is when you click on that, you get the code that loads alongside
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:13.360]   the application.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.920]   And you can start going in and modifying it.
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:17.240]   So you could modify the color of the eyeball.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.640]   You could modify the way that it works by just doing some simple--
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:23.320]   Simple changing the script slightly.
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:25.600]   So it's helping you to learn.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.080]   And so I think this was a really great project.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:31.440]   And I wanted to bring it up because it's really combining all of these things with the ultimate
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.600]   goal of increasing someone's ability to go out and do something that they weren't able
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.600]   to do before.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:40.840]   So I just think it's a really great use of all the code's open source.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:43.040]   It's using open hardware.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.960]   It's a Google-y experience, if you'll pardon the expression.
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:50.120]   But they're trying to make it really simple to use and understand.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.120]   It's very inexpensive.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.960]   And at the end of the day, you can write your own web app.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:55.880]   So anyway, that's Google Coder.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.480]   And if you are interested in learning web applications, I would highly recommend going
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:04.400]   out and picking up a Raspberry Pi and trying it out for yourself.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.400]   Very cool.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.400]   Really cool.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:11.880]   So it comes with helicopter eyeballs, base rocks, and then you can make your own.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]   Yeah.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.880]   And then you can make your own.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:14.880]   And it walks you through.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.080]   I was going to demo that as well.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:18.360]   But for some reason, it's not quite working.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:19.360]   Of course, it's a live demo.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.800]   It's not working.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.160]   But it'll actually-- you can do create a new app, and it'll take you through, OK, it starts
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.160]   out really simple.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.080]   What color do you want your app to be?
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:33.280]   And it looks a lot like the apps in the Chrome-- in the browser, right?
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.040]   When you do a Chrome app, it looks very, very similar to that.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.040]   Right.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.400]   So it's just a really simple way.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   They're trying to make it simple.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.720]   I love that they-- again, this is kind of a pet project, right?
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:49.960]   But I love that they took the time to build on what Raspberry Pi was doing to make it really
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.000]   easy for people to learn to code.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.760]   And right now, they're concentrated on web apps.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.760]   Maybe that's not your thing.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:00.080]   I hope that they've developed this into other applications.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:05.240]   So maybe Android development, or maybe learn how to code in Java or Python or something
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:10.360]   like that using a similar, easy to use kind of approach like this.
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.920]   So yeah, I think it's really cool.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.760]   I hope they continue to do stuff like this.
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:16.760]   Right on.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.760]   Right on.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:18.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.760]   That's a great platform.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.760]   So it's a great platform.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:21.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:22.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:23.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:24.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:25.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:26.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:27.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:28.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:30.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:31.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:32.760]   And I think it's a great platform.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:33.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:34.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:35.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:37.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:38.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:39.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:40.760]   It's a great platform.
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:41.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:06:08.760]   And it's a great platform.
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.700]   Tap it against the phone and what this does is it
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:15.620]   It's got an FM radio built in it's got a little tiny low-res screen
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:19.600]   You can receive calls you can answer it like a little Zoolander phone, right?
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.360]   So if you can what it does it enables you to have a gigantic
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:28.280]   Fablet in your backpack or your purse or or whatever or even you know
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:35.140]   10 feet away and when you get calls or want to listen to music or whatever you can use this thing as if it were a little phone
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:37.140]   But it's actually connected your to your device
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:41.700]   There are apps in the play store according to Sony that deliberately used this thing
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:45.400]   For it's essentially I considered a wearable computer
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:47.860]   It displays your
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:50.140]   Message notifications. It's waterproof
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:54.700]   It's just a weird like odd kind of thing that Sony came out with that
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:07:00.060]   I think deserves a lot more attention than it's getting on you as you can see from from the screen it clips on
[02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:05.620]   It can clip you can go to pocket it can clip onto your coat clip onto your if you're working out
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:10.040]   And so on it's great for the gym because you can clip it on your clothes in the sniff em radio
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:16.280]   Some gyms have the television sets in front of the treadmills have FM radio to convey the sound of the TVs
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:20.380]   So it's just a really cool device and it's a thing that enables you to
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:22.880]   Have a fablet as your phone
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:26.560]   Without having to pull this gigantic thing out of your
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:33.560]   Backpack all the time and you and put it up against your head to talk on the phone you can you can have this little tiny phone
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:35.740]   and
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:42.100]   You know, it's just a it's just a cool little device that I think is is just part of the it's both part of the
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:44.480]   wearable computing movement
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:50.640]   And it's also part of the fablet movement because it enables you to use a fablet in a more practical way
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:54.560]   Yeah, it looks really cool headset and handsets
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:59.400]   So it's not like a bluetooth headset, but but it's so it's kind of like an iPod mini
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:02.960]   But you can talk in it so you get your big screen, but you can just
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:07.700]   Into it and clip it onto your shirt and then your your device can be
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:13.960]   In the backseat of the car or whatever and you can interact, you know on the phone and listen to music and all that stuff
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.940]   It's like a price range on this. Oh, yeah. Oh
[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:24.780]   I don't I don't know and they don't have it listed and they don't have a link to but they up until very recently
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:28.480]   It said coming soon and now it doesn't say coming soon. So I assume that this is a
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:34.360]   Logizable and I don't know the price, but I will up but if anybody's curious about this product
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:37.620]   I'll be following up on Google+ as soon as I find out this information
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:43.180]   Yeah, it's really cool. It's like an uber bluetooth headset. I mean I like the fact that it has the buttons
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:45.520]   Looks like
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:47.860]   60 well like that's not American pounds
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.800]   So it's like 80 bucks. Yeah, yeah, 80 bucks. That's not bad for a bluetooth headset
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:56.640]   I was I just bought one yesterday in fact for it was a car, you know version for the car, but
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.480]   You know, I like that they give you the play buttons and and you know
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.360]   Whatever that uber button does in the middle. I mean that really I mean
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.000]   I don't know
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.760]   I think there's a place for this especially like you say when you got this huge thing that you don't want to always
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:16.620]   Want to have to whip out every time you want to pause your your music or you know, it really makes a lot of sense
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:19.460]   So I think it's really cool. It does it does look weird
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:24.320]   Strange unexpected things for example, it'll pair to two devices simultaneously
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:31.440]   So if you have two phones you can use this to answer both phones whack whack weird stuff like that. Yeah
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.740]   Huh very cool right cool
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:38.460]   My tip this week is pretty simple one
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:41.940]   It's kind of for kind of web development tip for people who like
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:49.740]   Typography and notice typography on different web pages. This is a new feature that in chrome that is coming out on chrome 31 plus
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:53.980]   So you can try it right now if you're on the dev channel or or using chrome canary
[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:59.700]   If you if you come across a web page with a cool looking font you want to know what the font is instead of going to what the font
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:01.300]   Which is usually what I do?
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:07.340]   You can just right click the text now and then new versions of chrome choose inspect element elements
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:12.020]   And you switch the computer computed tab down in the inspection panel
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:12.980]   And you can scroll down
[02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:19.740]   You'll see a summary of all the typefaces used for that element and Paul Irish great web developer said that this works
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:24.420]   This was works great. You'll see the typeface names for Google web fonts type kit
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:29.900]   Local fonts at font face typefaces Unicode glyphs all kinds of interesting
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:32.940]   Font sources and again, this is built right into chrome
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:37.900]   You don't know extension needed a third-party service needed and this is in the the dev versions of chrome
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:42.580]   So cool cool way to discover new typefaces and see you know what?
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:48.300]   What that cool, you know font is that's that's going on on a page that you're interested in
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:50.860]   chrome font 5 finder and
[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:55.060]   It just just if you're a developer use inspect element all the time
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:58.180]   So it's just down on Nick the computed tab there. Oh, that's cool
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:59.820]   Yeah, yeah
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.980]   I like I like what these things are built into the browser
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:08.340]   So the chrome really got two things the search reverse image search built into the right-click menu on images and this this typeface finder
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:10.340]   It's really nice
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:14.260]   Well, I think that that's a wrap. Thank you both
