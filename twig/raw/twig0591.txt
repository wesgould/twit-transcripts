[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Hello everybody Leo LePort here. Yes, I'm dressed funny. We've got a fire in the virtual fireplace.

[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.040]   You know, the whole idea is to give the hosts a little break, a little time off for the holidays
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.800]   and make the editors work their buns off. And yeah, we've accomplished the goal this year.

[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.200]   Hello everybody. I'm Leo LaPorte. We gave Stacy, Jeff, and Ant the week off because it's time once
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.280]   again for our best of our holiday special. I look forward to this all year. I get to put a roaring
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.560]   fire in my virtual fireplace. I get to put on silly clothes. And I get to really enjoy the holiday
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.680]   spirit as we look back at some of the best moments from 2020. Admittedly, 2020 not the best year of
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.400]   all time. In fact, some might argue one of the worst years since 1918, but we made it. Most of us
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.440]   and I'm glad you're here. Stacy, Jeff, and I had a lot of fun, including, as usual, you know, it's not
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.800]   just about Google talking about brand Twitter. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes not. On a lighter
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.200]   note, can I suggest something? Please. I just brought the show down. Please do.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.720]   We'll bring it back up again. Thank you. Down under other, the second under other,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   my favorite thing of the week. Oh, yes. Wendy is mean. Oh, Wendy. Why you got to be so mean?
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.880]   Wendy's burgers, of course, or I mean, the Wendy's restaurant. Last week we had new
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.120]   jerseys. Wendy's not mean. She is on fleek. Yes. Happy you said that, Carsten.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.080]   Yeah, apparently Wendy's Twitter feed is going nuts. You go to the Twitter feed and she's calling
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   everybody out left right and center. There's a report that Burger King is going to have a
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   testing to say on which with nothing but french fries inside to which Wendy said,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.320]   when literally anything would be better on a bun than their beef.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   But you know, there's probably some shoots of that Burger King to a posted a picture of the
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.200]   Burger King, which is the creepiest thing. Yeah, I agree. Yeah.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.120]   Saying roses of red ballads or blue patties are round trying to get at Wendy's. Wendy's did not
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.680]   miss a beat and came back and said look to drop by to see what spicy nuggets were supposed to taste.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.760]   Oh, oh, spicy. Hey, this is the worst one. Picture from a woman on Twitter.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Two guys with a dumpster outside of McDonald's with with face masks on. Wendy's. What do you
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.160]   think they're doing here? Wendy's replies picking up their order. Oh, this is great. I like this.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.240]   Yeah, but and I don't want to get into like political stuff because that's like something I don't
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.120]   really discuss in general. You need to do it. But it's like this whole normalization of
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.920]   just being a Twitter troll now. I mean, it's ridiculous. Yeah, brand. I mean,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.680]   brand Twitter has has very much followed Wendy's examples and and has become a very interesting place
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.280]   for a very interesting sub segment of Twitter. Missy realized they don't need to be polite
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.640]   anymore. They have more attention. Right. Exactly. Mr. Jarvis in your day when
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:58.320]   what young man when newspapers were being printed regularly. Do you remember seeing ads like this
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   where a company would call out? You know, Wendy's would call out of McDonald's. No,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   you know, buying an ad space like that in our mark. We would say they would say they
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.880]   subtweeted. That was subtweet. Well, where's the beef? Yeah, but what about just examples?
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   They were calling out of the specific right brain, which is what ants asked. They wouldn't say,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.160]   Hey, McDonald's. Where's the beef? All right. Right. I don't think they would ever say it like that.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   Anyway, no, I'm from Jersey. Was the big was that Jeff or Joey talking to us.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:44.960]   I don't know. I like picturing the Wendy's Wendy saying that. Hey, McDonald's. Where's the beef?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   Hey, chomping on a cigar. Where's the beef? Yeah, you. You guys don't look mean.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.240]   Oh, yeah, these trolls, but you're right. That is exactly what I was thinking too, is that it has
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.360]   normalized up for everybody. It's a really good way. He are departments.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.920]   And last week, we did we did the story of the New Jersey Twitter feed, the official NJ
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   to go Twitter feed, which since then the New York Times did a big feature on them. I'm sure
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.040]   because they heard about it on Twitter. Of course. And and it's not as bad as Wendy's,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.480]   but it still has sass. Yeah. That one being the memory once someone says,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.360]   who let New Jersey have a Twitter and New Jersey official account responded, your mom.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:44.880]   No, it's it's funny though, but I guess it was funny, but it's yeah. I don't like where all this is
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.480]   headed. Yeah, I had not considered the whole normalization of Twitter trolling. I mean,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.080]   that's yeah, it's a really good point. It's a very, very fair point.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   Should I go back to COVID-19 just because I just got my King County health recommendations or
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:08.560]   oh, okay. Sure. The guidance of the public, the King County public health board issued a thing
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.680]   just now saying for workplaces of businesses, all employees should work from home. If they are
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.080]   able, employers should take steps to make it more feasible for their employees to work in ways
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.200]   that minimize close contact with large numbers of people. They should maximize telecommuting
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.680]   options, urgent place to stay home when they are sick and maximize flexibility and sick leave,
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.840]   and consider staggering start and end times to reduce large numbers of people coming together
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.880]   at the same time. For schools, do not cancel them unless there's been a confirmed case in the school.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.120]   And if you are a caregiver of a child with an underlying health condition,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.240]   you should consult with your health care provider whether or not they should stay home.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:57.840]   If they stay home, that's okay. Okay. So that's going to trigger a lot of businesses to,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.240]   you know, it's going to force them, but very seriously encourages them to take a look at how
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.440]   their business is running to make changes that may or no. Oh, and it is saying that for event
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   and community gathering considerations, if you could feasibly avoid bringing large groups of
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   people together, consider postponing events and gatherings. So that does come a ton right there.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.400]   If you can't avoid bringing groups of people, urge people or sick not to attend,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   encourage those who are at higher risk for coronavirus, not to attend,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.840]   try to find ways to give people more physical space so they're not in close contract,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.480]   clean surfaces, and encourage attendees to wash their heads.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.640]   When is Comic-Con? When is that? It's the 14th.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.240]   So it's okay. Everybody's behind the mask. It'll be fine.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.320]   Actually, comment. Sorry. It's the 13th. It's the 12th. It starts the 12th.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.800]   And that's in Seattle. It's in Seattle. It's Emerald City Comic-Con. I'm so sad. I'm glad we didn't
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   close play it because my daughter and I were originally going to go as people from the Dragon
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.680]   Prince. Si. What's interesting about that, Stacey, too, is that, you know, like in Japan,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.720]   they shut down the schools, but they didn't know anything. What about the parents? What do you do?
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.160]   So in this case, they're kind of saying that, well, the parents are sure to behold.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.760]   That's true. They're standing. Yeah, it is.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.160]   It's hard. There's a couple of things to think about, right? Sometimes kids only get lunch and
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.040]   breakfast at school. So when you shut down the schools, you're shutting down their access to
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:32.160]   nutrition. Parents don't necessarily have a way to keep their job and keep an eye on their kid.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.760]   These are things, again, I'm not trying to be political, but there is a decided lack of
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.800]   any sort of safety net in our country that really makes this whole thing extra fraught for people who
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.760]   start with sick days. Yep. People who are sick will have to show up to work to earn the money.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.160]   And I kind of don't blame them. They can't be cautious.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:03.520]   Talk about the restaurant industry just as one example, right? Like that's an hourly industry.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.120]   If you don't show up, usually, and most of the restaurants that I ever worked in in my
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.800]   restaurant career, you don't get paid if you don't show up. Nope. And so then if that's your
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.320]   livelihood, and that's how you make your money and not going there means you don't make a paycheck,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.360]   then I imagine a lot of people choose to ultimately go there because they have to.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.320]   People still want food. But they're also serving food. Oh, man, it's just a messy situation.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   Can't blame it. Sorry to bring it back. I just like breaking news, you guys. No, no, that is
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.400]   news. Yeah, it is news. You're ahead of the Seattle Times. I don't find it there. But you're still
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.960]   but you're still on for your presentation, right? Well, I'm waiting to see. I mean, this
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.920]   literally came. This is the email that came in eight minutes ago from King County Public Health
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   Department. The way it all changes. It's so rapid right now. Who the heck knows? Literally
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.200]   subscribing to King County Health Department. How did you know? Of course I am.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:07.200]   Okay. I don't subscribe. I'm a journalist. Jeff, I subscribed to every public, public body in my
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:15.120]   area. No, I mean, don't you? No, because I don't cover my town. But don't you want accurate
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.840]   information? Like I found like I always listen, if I can, to the press conferences and look at
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.720]   things because sometimes I'm sorry, local journalists, some of y'all are wonderful, but sometimes
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.840]   their headlines are misleading. Yeah. Or things aren't quite I'm sorry. I know they're there.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.080]   It's not that's not the journalist. A lot of times that's the editor. I know those editors.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.880]   Oh, it was the editors. Yeah. That's why I blog. So I got rid of editors. Very happy.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:50.000]   So one of the things I always call twig. I know it says this week in Google, but I call it our
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   variety show because our hosts have varied interests. There's a lot of things we can talk about.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:03.040]   And frankly, all of us are kind of interested in cooking, including it's perfect for the season,
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.600]   making a great pie. You didn't get much pie. I'm sorry. I got a bit of a slice out of there.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   I'm good for tomorrow. I love how he looked like a guilty German. I know it's like you.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.920]   Yeah, busted. I'm not hiding it. I love pie. He's titrating that pie. He's gonna get that
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.840]   pie to last all day. Just. Oh, I'm sorry, and we should really have a good conversation that
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.960]   doesn't involve ants. So he can like really shut down. It's a little birthday present for
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.520]   Ant is leaving in the lonely. I still have pie for, you know, post show work. The next 15 minutes
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.560]   after the show will be gone. I love you. I gave you a whole pie just for yourself. I love it too.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.320]   That's so grateful. We got a second one for the staff. So they got to have. What kind of berries?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.200]   Mary and Barry. Mary and Barry. Oh, they are Mary, but they're really Mary and Barry.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.720]   I didn't know where that was until moving out here. Oh, they're delicious. They're kind of like
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.520]   blackberries. Yeah, that's correct. I was like, I've had Mary and Barry pie. Is it just a coincidence
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.480]   that the former mayor of Washington, D.C. that was busted for cocaine? Yes. It's just a name.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.160]   Mary and Barry. Your coincidence. Yeah, because his parents probably didn't know there was a
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.800]   California thing called a Mary and Barry. Probably not. Mary and Blackberry. And I don't see any.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.840]   It's not just California. It's it's Oregon too. It's what? Oregon. Oregon. All right.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.200]   West Coast. West Coast. They don't have it in North khaki lackey.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.280]   Nope. We just call them blackberries over there. It's a variant.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:38.880]   California takes everything special. Special. Of course. California variety. Are those
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.560]   oh, are those carriagate California? They have them appear in Washington. They're from
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   Mary and you left. Oregon. That's what I heard. And they do look. They are based
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.000]   at their blackberries. That's a blackberry. We call those do berries in Houston.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.040]   They look just like Ollie berries or all that. They're all just different variants. Oh, that's
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.600]   what those look like too. Yeah. Okay. Right. Carces and Ollie berries similar. Ollie berries are
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:10.000]   more like blueberries. Oh, okay. No. Okay. It's a cross between an Ollie Blackberry and a
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.760]   chajalom blackberry. Never heard of them, but it's delicious. So there's an Ollie berry. But
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   on the Ollie berry, they don't have a picture of the berry. Just the pie. Nothing. Enough said.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.640]   I need pie. This is what pie is going to be. Oh boy. Do I need pie now? Yeah.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:35.920]   Duarte's in Pescadero on route one. Go now. Oh, yeah. I've been there. That's right. That's good.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.680]   Pescadero. Yeah. I grew up in Santa Cruz. The berry Ollie berry was a selection from a cross
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.160]   between the black Logan developed by Judge James Logan in California and the young berry developed
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   by Burns Young and Louisiana. Young berry. According to Judge Logan, black Logan was a cross between
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   the Eastern Blackberry Crandall and the Western Dewberry also known as the look at this word.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:09.680]   Awkambag. I don't know. Awkambag. Young berry is from the phenomenal versus Austin Mayes. Not Austin
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:17.120]   Myers. Austin phenomenal. There are old berry. The Aukambag Western Dewberry and the Cuthbert Red
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.000]   Raspberry. Good Lord. I had no idea there was so much work being done in Blackberry horticulture.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.320]   There is though. I appreciate their work because this pie is great. You think it must be really easy
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.840]   to cross blackberries? Like they just beg to be crossed? Blackberries are a scourge upon the
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   earth. They they hurt. They are. Yeah, those brambles are awful. We have the road we live on is lined with
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.960]   blackberry bushes and Lisa has a penchant to go out and pick them. We make the boys pick them.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.160]   Nope. Always go out with long sleeves. I had to teach my boys a serving though. Where your long sleeves
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.960]   when you go pick the berries. She makes a pie. Blackberry season. Pie days coming up March 14th
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:10.000]   Saturday. Everybody have some pie. It would be just another day for me. Sometimes on this week in
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.760]   Google, hilarity ensues. We're going to I think one of the funniest moments of the year is coming
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.320]   up in just a little bit before we get to that though. I do want to thank a sponsor. Been with us most
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.240]   of the year and somebody I've known for a long time and used for many years as a hobbyist. I'm talking
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.480]   about Twilio. Stacy is a big Twilio fan too. We both use Twilio but really it's not how we use
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.880]   it. Although if we can use it, anybody can. It's really how some of the biggest companies in the
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:44.640]   world are using Twilio to build new ways to help customers. Twilio helps you engage your customers
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:51.440]   wherever they are on any channel anywhere from text messaging to emails to phone calls to video
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.840]   and more all in a single powerful platform. When I say big, I mean big Twilio power 795 billion
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:07.920]   plus interactions across all its channels with five nines of uptime. That's 99.999% uptime. That's
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.640]   pretty darn good. They have over three just to give you an idea of the scale. Three billion
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.800]   phone numbers available across more than 100 countries. Customers love what Twilio has done
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.000]   for them. Just ask Shopify. They run their entire global contact center supporting more than a
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   million customers on Twilio's Flex platform. That's their programmable contact center solution.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   Blue Apron uses Twilio. We know them and if you subscribe to their newsletter, thank Twilio.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.360]   Blue Apron sends their newsletter emails with Twilio's Sendgrid. We've all used, I hope,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.280]   two-factor authentication. Netflix uses Twilio for their two-factor authentication. And of course,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.520]   I'm a big fan of Twilio's Authy app, a free app that I use exclusively for two-factor. Twilio
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.800]   knows two-factor for sure. And if you're ever using Lyft or Uber for delivery or ride sharing,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:07.200]   when you get those texts that says your driver's on the way, you guessed it, it comes in via Twilio.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.280]   Products and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their users
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.400]   inside applications. Twilio's got an amazing API. But here's the thing. Twilio is built by
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   developers for developers. So it's not hard. It's not complicated. In fact, they take all the
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.920]   complexity out of it. You don't have to be a specialized telecom network engineer to use Twilio.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.360]   If you can develop web applications, if your developers are already doing web applications,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.200]   they can include Twilio features with just a few lines of code. It's that easy. Text, call,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.280]   chat, video conferencing, Twilio does it all. Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.840]   communications across your entire business. Go to Twilio.com to learn more today. We love it. Twilio,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:03.040]   T-W-I-L-I-O, Twilio.com. It's time to build. So there was one segment we did this year that I had
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:11.440]   a really hard time not just kind of losing it. Well, just watch. You'll see why.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:21.360]   So speaking of the Guardian, their story astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.840]   while inventing coronavirus device caught my attention the other day.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.000]   Shall I read it to you? Oh, please do. It is an excellent story, please.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.000]   An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.360]   his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:50.240]   outbreak. Dr. Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at a Melbourne University, was building a necklace
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:56.800]   that sounds an alarm on facial contact when the mishap occurred last Thursday night. The 27-year-old
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:03.040]   astrophysicist who studies pulsars and gravitational waves says he was trying to liven up the boredom
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:11.680]   of self-isolation with a four powerful neodymium magnets. Stacey, how powerful are those neodymium
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:19.600]   magnets? Very powerful. They can rip your intestines too. You've heard, they're really fun to play with,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.840]   but boy, when you put them close to each other, they go, "Bam!" He says, "I have some electronic
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   equipment, but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things. I had a part that
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   detects magnetic fields. I thought if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set up an alarm if you brought it too close to
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.560]   your face." A bit of boredom and isolation made me think of that. However, the Guardian goes on,
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   the academic realized the electronic part he had did the opposite and would only complete a circuit
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.240]   when there was no magnetic field present. I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzed
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:09.840]   continuously unless you move your hand close to your face." He said, "So, after scrapping that idea,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.000]   I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.680]   close pins to your ears. I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.000]   and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.920]   He said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils and two on the outside.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:42.800]   I was hoping I could get through this. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:51.760]   the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.440]   magnets to remove them at this point. Having researched, having called somebody and said,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.920]   "What do you do when this happens? Why do you use a magnet to get a magnet?" At this point,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.720]   my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me. He said, "I was trying to pull them out,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.960]   but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose that you can't get past." After struggling for 20
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.480]   minutes, I decided to Google the problem. There is his mistake right there. I found an article
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:29.520]   about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem. The solution in that was more magnets to put on
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.240]   the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside. As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.680]   magnets, they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip. Those two magnets ended up in my left
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:51.200]   nostril while the other one was in my right. At this point, I ran out of magnets. Probably a good
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:58.880]   thing. Before attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   they became magnetized by the magnets inside his nose. Every time I brought the pliers to my nose,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:16.400]   my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:26.960]   It was a little bit painful at this point, he reports. My partner took me to the hospital and
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.840]   she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought it was quite
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.040]   funny making comments like, "This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom."
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:42.400]   At the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anesthetic spray and manually
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:49.760]   removed the magnets from Reardon's nose. By the way, it's not over quite yet.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.800]   "When they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat," he said.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.280]   "That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed a breath in, but I was thankfully
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.440]   able to lean forward and cough it out. Needless to say, I am not going to play with the magnets anymore."
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:16.400]   Is the greatest story, isn't it? So, just a word of warning.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.320]   Kids don't try this at home. These are the same injuries that small children have.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.120]   They're very serious because, again, if they swallow, they will rip through your intestines.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.480]   But for a grown astrophysicist.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:41.200]   Yeah, you should never like kids play with these super magnets. They are really problematic.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.520]   Here's a picture just to complete the story. Here's a picture.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.120]   "His full humiliation." "I have Dr. Daniel Reardon in the hospital
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:57.440]   after removal of the magnets from his nose." "I give him a lot of points for confessing."
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.360]   It is one of the funniest stories I've ever. And then also, they have the medical discharge
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.560]   summary. "Tonight's further magnets."
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:15.520]   Two hours ago, I had two neodymium 7 millimeter in diameter strong magnets up bilateral nostrils
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.600]   stuck to each other via septum, bilaterally attempted removal thread using two other magnets up
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.520]   left nostril ended with three magnets up left nostril, one upright all stuck together
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.000]   via septum. "Denise difficulty breathing denies further magnets."
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.160]   We needed that. Hey, Jeff had a great interview, by the way,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.760]   with a Unabomber, Nathan Alabak, who is also, as it turns out, little known, the voice of
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.560]   Steakum. He just has a very aggressive beard. He's a wonderful guy. He's a nerd. He was hired as
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:02.000]   their... Well, so he was... Is that really a beard? It's a marketing company. It's a...
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:12.000]   Okay. Does that look a little fake? The beard? Oh, no, it's... He was pulling on it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Okay. So he calls himself a nerd. He's a nerd. So, and he's a company, Alabak,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.920]   had been doing food marketing stuff. And like three years ago, Steakums came and said, "We're
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.400]   for old people like Jarvis. It's been around since the '70s when people like that ate cheesesteaks
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:38.480]   at home. And so, he said, "Let me take over the Twitter account and give it a voice that says,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.200]   'Gee, even Steakums says that.' And a voice of pre-sanity." This is pre-COVID. It was three years
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.800]   ago. This is three years. So, the long comes COVID while every other advertiser is running away,
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:57.200]   and to hell with them putting no COVID content on their forbidden list, they ran toward it.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:05.280]   And he has this voice of sanity and reason and science from a frozen meat product.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.000]   He's also extremely honest in this saying, "Hey, folks, don't forget, I'm a marketer trying to sell
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.440]   you a frozen meat product." It's funny, it's ironic. And we've talked about it before. It's really
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:24.160]   one of the best brands in the face of COVID of anybody. So, I talked to him about a bunch of
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.680]   stuff. But what I found fascinating, which you guys will like, is that he really understands
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:38.560]   social community. He goes in and he figures out, he looks at a librarian Twitter and media Twitter
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.800]   and weird Twitter and Stan Twitter's of K-pop. And he listens to them and he reads them and he sees
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.680]   what's missing and he knows how to enter in. He knows how to have a conversation. He listens first.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.360]   The reason I talked to him because it struck me as instructional for my journalism students
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.640]   and social journalism. And he really gets that gospel of listening to people, understanding with
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.760]   them, empathizing with them. One of the interesting things about him is that his name is out there,
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   he's Nathan Alabach, and his Twitter account is out there. So, he can't really be himself
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.760]   because people are going to say, "Oh, that's the stake sky." It's just like the Comcast guy,
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.280]   Comcast Frank.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.600]   Comcast Frank. Yeah. He kind of made it hard for him.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.800]   But he, okay, I got a question. So, in the days of Comcast, Frank,
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.840]   Frank really did very well for Comcast by making them appear to be responsive
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.240]   to customer issues. Something they've since given up. But it was a moment in time when it
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.440]   really worked well. He was brilliant at it. Fast forward though, doesn't matter if a brand is on
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.600]   Twitter these days. There's some ancillary coverage you get, but most people, normal people,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:56.400]   aren't on Twitter. And even if you are on Twitter, no matter what tweet, it goes by, right? It's not.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   You have to be there. Oh, I'm going to disagree. Look at another brand. Look at what
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:07.440]   Taco Bell, my favorite. Yeah, but I'm on Twitter. And I don't see Taco Bell because I don't...
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.480]   But it doesn't matter because your friends will talk about it or the cool, you're not the cool
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.080]   kids, but the cool kids will talk about it. There's now a Taco Bell literary magazine. Do we tell
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.120]   you that I thought? I think it's irrelevant. No. I think Taco Bell, when I think it's... Taco Bell
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.040]   quarterly. I think you're interested because you're interested in Taco Bell. No, they made
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:34.320]   new customers. Taco Bell quarterly. Do we read this last week? No. Do we do this? No. Go there.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.400]   TacoBell Quarterly.org. It has nothing to do with Taco Bell. This is fan fiction, right?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.040]   This is people came up so volume two has Taco Bell poetry and fiction.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.480]   Oh my God, Jeff, this is where we can write our queso like,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.400]   exactly the queso-reader requiem.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:01.120]   Eating you, your voice rings by heart. A language turned into light waves traveling at a pace to
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.040]   crack one's soul. It is break-grabby. And spitting at times and swallowing and brushing my bristled
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.640]   chin, the light now flamenco's mirror to mirror until it becomes noise again, bending and loud
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.760]   and rhythmless. Okay, well, never mind. So all of this stuff with standing, does it sell more tacos?
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.560]   Yeah. Eating cages to people who like you. I mean, that brands love this stuff. That's pretty,
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:33.200]   okay, that's pretty obvious. And you're able to if you're already a fan, then you're following
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.680]   Taco Bell or stacom or whatever. And so you can talk about this and blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.720]   I just don't think it's it's when I come along out of nowhere and I retweet
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   stacoms and somebody says, what the age I've never what is what's what's going on.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.080]   They discover stacoms too. They have to go to the store and buy stacom. Yes, I have tons of friends
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.160]   because they want to reward him because it's so good who are buying. Now, the problem here
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   is that I would kill for it by wife like you doesn't like your wife doesn't let you go to the
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.680]   store and she doesn't want me to have stacoms. So I can't get me stacoms. There's better,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:11.840]   better meat. That's if you're going to get I want it. I want a steak,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:19.520]   a little provolone and grilled onions on a roll that and Taco Bell or the two things I miss.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   Okay, badly. All right. I will accept your yes. We are having meatball
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.960]   paninis tonight and they're going to be delicious. Are you homemade or are you going to get them out
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.360]   from the no, no, I don't make meatballs. The local Bainbridge meatball vendor.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.000]   Oh, that would be nice. No, I have I always keep meatballs in the freezer.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.520]   Ah, but our son for unaccountably has suddenly got a Jones for meatloaf.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.160]   That's great. Meatloaf is the easiest thing in the world. Okay.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.240]   Yeah, comfort food. Do you put a ketchup on top? Oh, yeah, you got it. Right after
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.600]   I put a one steak sauce on my it's delicious. Oh, you fancy meatloaf.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:06.800]   You're going, that's French meatloaf. So, okay.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:14.160]   Okay, I just was curious because it's actually an internal conversation we have. We have a very
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.560]   good, very active social media presence on Twitter. We have Jerry.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:27.200]   Here's the thing about it. I feel like that's nice. And I guess it's but there's a difference, Leo.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.840]   What your social media presence does is promote what you already have. Right.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:40.480]   What what stakems does is create a persona and a voice and an empathy with people
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:48.720]   and irony and humor and intelligence. Right. And and Taco Bell is different, but it's very
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.520]   similar. It created so the Taco Bell was not cool. It was it was ridiculed. Now Taco Bell is cool.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.680]   I'm always cool. Taco Bell is always part of your drunk eating. I got ready to.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.840]   Maybe you're cool. That is maybe in Texas, but I got ridiculed forever.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.920]   Oh, that's because you're a grown man.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.680]   Let's get your grown man.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.240]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.640]   If you were eight years old, I understand.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:23.520]   It's for a trip to college kids in high school kids. That's what Taco Bell's for.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.360]   I want to be young. You want to be a little bit.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.720]   You won't let me.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.000]   I mean, you could be young, Jeff, if you want to turn back.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   The cost of one Alan back. Yeah. Tweeting is less than one ad on a network.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.800]   That was the other show. One story I read said they basically go through the budget and they
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.440]   said, hmm, what am I going to do? And Alan Mike said, I hate, why don't I try this? Yeah.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.880]   And they didn't expect. I mean, they didn't they didn't go into this thinking this is going to
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:05.200]   turn viral. But boom, one day and it did. Yeah. And and stakems is happy.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.880]   I asked him too about the relationship with the brand because I said, you know, what what
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.080]   they got to be nervous sometimes. They said, yeah, you know, you know, there are things that go on.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.840]   Maybe you don't want to do that again, list. But generally, he spent three years developing
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.200]   trust with the brand with his client and also developing trust between the brand and the public.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.760]   And so it's kind of brilliant. He's just a nice guy. He's a musician.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.600]   Songwriter who decided when he got married, he said, I got to have a job.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.960]   Good for him. So and, you know, he is thick. He has done the thing that you really want to do,
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.800]   which is he's created a voice. He really has. He's also on Twitch.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.320]   By the way, he's a gamer. What is he stream? I don't know. Can you can you look him up?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:56.000]   No, no, he does not. He gave games. Well, I guess maybe, well, if you go to,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:06.400]   if you go to Nathan Alabak's Twitter account, you'll see his his. So it's Twitter slash Nathan
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.520]   Alabak. He he was last live 16 hours ago. Right. And
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:22.720]   what does he do the history of media polarization and prominent political identities. So I guess
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.480]   he just comes on and talks. Yeah, he's he's he's a bit of a
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   auto-dedact. Call himself. Yeah, you call himself a nerd. So he just works.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:39.680]   He is a great dog. He is a great dog. He does. No, that's not a great dog. That's somebody else.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.240]   That's another person. No, there's a dog. Do you not see the dog? Oh, yeah. There's the dog. Yeah.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.880]   I thought that was an alpha. He's a good guy. So let's say, no, no, I'm not knocking him. No,
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.400]   no, you're not. I know you're not. I just like the guy a lot. Here's your dog a moment for you.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:07.280]   Stacey. Okay, that's a guy to love. Yes. Puppies. Oh, more puppies. Puppy content. So he's good on
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.880]   twist. Oh, that's the best. Yeah. Look at that. Love. Happy dogs. Look at that tail.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:22.240]   Poor Jeff Jarvis every year. I see him get pinker and bigger
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:30.320]   and scream louder and louder about moral panic. In fact, this was the year that God
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.760]   repeatedly tried to strike Jeff dead. I want I need a Leo complete.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.920]   Holy cow. Did you hear that? Yeah.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:49.360]   She's right there. You're going to sleep good tonight. Holy. That was killed. That was quite a
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.080]   thunderbolt there that if we lose power, we do have a generator, but it takes a few minutes to come in.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.680]   So wow. I thought there was a way in settings. If you turn on
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:07.280]   cheese, Louise, Louise, Louise. No, no, I love it. Are you kidding? We don't get thunder and
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:13.360]   lightning here in California. You don't know. Just wind earthquakes. Just earthquakes.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.600]   And they're quieter. They're much quieter. Here comes another one.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:24.960]   Wow. So how many are you counting the seconds? No, I forgot how to do that.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:32.400]   Seven seconds a mile per mile. I remember that. I just go to dark sky and look at the
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.480]   just like at the I look at the radar map. What are you talking about?
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.920]   Yeah, what are you crazy? New version.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:47.600]   Perfect. Can you get to God and fugue? That was perfect.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.920]   I feel like this is a Vincent Vincent Price movie.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.480]   Here we're just just tell Twitter. I love them.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.880]   Oh my gosh. Get some thunder.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.840]   Get some thunder.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:16.480]   Tell us about your podcast there, detector. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's a regular,
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.480]   normal sort of podcast. Oh, the thunder. I like this one.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.720]   No, not like this one.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:33.840]   Google now has a new healthcare. We can't make this up. I love it. I love it. I love it.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.560]   Can you add sort of like a flickering effect? Yeah, the lights should go down.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.480]   Just get that underneath light. You know, the worst part left.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.520]   And now. Very.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.120]   Or.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.640]   From the from the crypt, the crypt kicker. He brought them out of the desk.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.440]   Pretty sure.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:03.760]   Wind.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.080]   Obviously, Jeff Jarvis is with us alive and well.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.200]   We love Jeff and we hope to do many, many more years of this week in Google with my good friend,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.680]   Jeff and of course, Stacy and and it's just a fun time to get together.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.360]   Coming up in just a little bit, we're going to talk a little about coronavirus
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.400]   and its impact on Japanese roller coasters. Yeah, there's a story there. Before we get to that,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.360]   I want to tell you about a great podcast. One that I really love. It's called Command Line

[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.080]   but she really does. There's an episode about and these are people you probably never heard of,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:06.560]   but are movers and shakers like Gladys West. You know the name? No, but you know her work,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.680]   her mathematical models and data analysis made GPS possible.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.960]   Jerry Lawson invented the first cartridge based video game console. Yes, before Atari, before
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.560]   Nintendo, before Sega. And then the story of Mark Dean raised in the Jim Crow South,
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.320]   but grew up to revolutionize the PC industry with the Isobus.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:32.800]   A Saranya Barak is amazing. She herself is a developer. She's a great podcaster and she brings
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.680]   out the best in her guests. Check out all the incredible stories from season six today. Search

[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:55.520]   continued seasons. Good jobs, Saran. Now it's time to get back to Japanese roller coasters.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.480]   Yeah, amusement parks have been closed for a long time, but the folks in Japan have figured
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:08.080]   out a way to make roller coasters safe. Watch. The amusement parks are reopening, but because
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:15.680]   screaming is dangerous. In Japan, they're saying you may ride the roller coaster, but you cannot scream.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:24.480]   Get stop there right there. So line is please scream inside your heart. So everyone on Twitter
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.680]   right now was saying that's exactly how I feel. We're all screaming inside our house.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.520]   I got to see the video. This is a video of two executives from the, we'll turn on the sound
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.280]   from the amusement park riding the roller coaster. This is how they suggest you ride the roller
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:50.480]   coaster. I would say that if you have a mask on, you could scream quietly. They are riding the
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:58.720]   roller coaster without screaming. This is, you know, my palms are sweating already. This is a bridge
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.240]   thing. Oh, I don't like roller coasters either. Oh, they're going up. They're very stoic.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.200]   They're like, you know, kamikaze pilots. They're about to descend. You know, is that bad? Is that
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.600]   considered? No. Well, it was a thing Japanese people did. I know, but it's not okay. Not a good
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.760]   thing. Not something we should bring up. I don't want to offend anybody. Just because... Too
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:32.400]   late. Way too late. Honestly, you know, we went to the kamikaze in Japan. We're in Japan. They had
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.520]   the kamikaze museum. And they were talking back to these guys and here's the stuff I hit. Yeah, I don't
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.200]   know. The ships that they dive bombed into. I don't know if they really thought they were heroes.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.040]   It's making me nervous. They're almost to the top.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:58.400]   They really are quite stoic. Now, see, you're girding yourself. You're starting to sweat on his
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.560]   forehead a little bit. I see a little sweat on it. See, just because you're a amusement park executive,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:09.280]   doesn't mean you actually ride these things. I think as your panna does. Does it? You're
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.840]   required to? I think they're very much a... This is a salaryman job here. Okay.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.960]   He's just looking around. Yeah, this guy's like, "Chill, but they're not going fast yet. They haven't
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:26.880]   dropped." Okay, now they're going down. Here it goes. This is how you're supposed to enjoy a roller
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   coaster. Oh, mask fell off. Hold that mask back. No screaming. No enjoying. Scream inside your heart.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:43.760]   You don't? Do you lift your hands off the barn? No. I just don't scream. I don't know. I just don't
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:51.200]   think I'm a loud... This is the most anticlimactic roller coaster experience I think I've ever seen.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.400]   I'm a weird video. Actually, do you think it would be... You'd feel better about a roller coaster if
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.440]   you didn't scream, if you just screamed inside your heart? Well, I'm about to do it. Are they
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.600]   sanitizing each thing? Because this guy has touched his face mask like a gajillion times. Yeah,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.520]   I want that thing sanitized. This is why I'm not going to the amusement park anytime soon.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.840]   And what keeps falling off? Because those... There's a lot of velocity happening there.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.640]   I bet my mask wouldn't fall off. He's trying to be good. Keep in the masking place. Yeah,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:29.440]   he's keeping in the masking place. Maybe that's what he's demonstrating. And the other guy who has a
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:40.160]   properly fitted mask, he's just screaming in his heart. Do you think there's a camera operator in this
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:47.840]   first car? The camera is moving. Yeah. Imagine having to do this backwards. He's not screaming either.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:54.320]   Wouldn't it be funny if at the end they go, "Ahh!" They have to shoot it all over again.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:01.360]   This is going to be excellent COVID artifact right here. It is so weird. It is so weird. Yeah,
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:08.320]   do you think... I think that all the time, COVID artifact. That was exciting. Is that hair must?
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   Nope. All done. So I put up in the bottom of the other on the rundown. Mike Masnick reacting
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.640]   to this because everybody's recognized. Yeah. And she was Masnick again in the Masnick fan club.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:28.080]   Yeah. I was going to say, I'm like, "I can leave, Jeff." No, I know. We're going to get a room.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:37.920]   A great thread, which I just read. Oh, he's shaking. His hands are shaking. Yeah.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:47.600]   Mike, as a nipper, heated rollercoasters wouldn't do it, despised it. And his friends on this
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.160]   summer camp like thing kept bugging at me. He said, "Okay, if I ride this one, you'll leave me alone."
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:01.200]   And he said, "Okay." So they dragged him to it and they told him, "You're not going to be afraid
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:08.720]   if you scream." And he screamed and he felt better. So now you can't. I'm just screaming in your
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:15.440]   heart. Actually, that's true. The times I've been tricked into rollercoasters, I scream as loud
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.880]   as I can the whole time. That does seem to help a little bit. Makes you... I couldn't because I would
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:28.560]   be passed out and dead. Coronary. Happy birthday to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:36.240]   Wait a minute. We sent Jeff a little birthday gift. Actually, Carson gets credit for this.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.960]   And poor Jeff got it yesterday and has not been able to eat it.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:50.160]   Pull down the lower third so he can see it. Oh my God. It's a giant taco cake. It's bigger than I thought.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.400]   It's a coronavirus cake. Oh, it's not a please. I show them out. Although they do use the same mold.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:04.960]   Same man. I can't believe that Carson managed to find a taco cake. And from the best bakery in the
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:13.680]   region. Yeah. Swiss chalet. Yeah. Morristown. Isn't that awesome? Now, what kind of cake is in there?
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.640]   Do we know? Looks like chocolate. We're going to slice it right now. We'll see.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.920]   Nobody... It's not tacos. Looks like a cake, but it's actually a taco.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:28.640]   Slice off a little bit of it here. I set off a piece of that rhona virus cake.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:35.440]   Oh man. Happy birthday to Jeff. Are you doing anything to celebrate besides this?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.320]   No, I'm just trying to avoid it and not be older. I know. You know, when we get past... When you get
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:49.440]   past the big 6.0. Oh my god. It's six layers. Five layers with... Yeah.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:56.080]   Oh, you can take it. You're very welcome. Happy birthday. Let me have a little bite now.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:03.920]   Happy birth. Carson says that's the smallest one they have. Oh, damn, it's good. Oh, that's
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.560]   awesome. That's good. Nice. Happy birthday. That's really good. We have another bite. I was going to
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:14.640]   have one bite for them. Pretty soon he's going to have taco cake community. It's great. Cheers to
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.160]   you, you'll have to be able to see any bodies. See, he's still here. We just... In fact, he had a
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.320]   very happy birthday. Now, we've been talking all year long now that we're all doing these
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:32.640]   shows via, you know, Skype and Zoom and everybody's kind of cultivating their background. I think
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.720]   great. My skiperum should give me an 11 out of 10 for this background. I think it's pretty good.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:45.760]   But Stacey's background, well, you know, Jeff was coming off his recent 10 out of 10. And I think
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:51.920]   he felt compelled to try to help Stacey a little bit with some suggestions to dress up her sack.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:58.160]   Hello, y'all. You got a bookshelf. You got books. You're really... I have a plant.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:05.200]   There. I think she needs a moose. We really... We... Yeah, that's Jeff Jarvis, by the way,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.720]   professor of journalism at the Craig... And interior decorator. Yeah, School of Journalism at the
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.880]   Townite Center. He's at the city of Risenier. He's of course... Not the kangaroo. He's stuffed kangaroo
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:23.200]   would fit nicely there. We were looking at some tags here for me. Although most of it was weird,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:28.400]   Carsten sent along a rat with butterfly wings. I didn't think that would really suit... I thought
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:35.600]   the Bob Ross rat was excellent. And then I sent a creature from my nightmares who does rival,
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   which rivals Spot for like striking terror into my heart. It was a frog, taxidermied frog with
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:49.760]   the teeth of a shark. And it was... Yeah, it was pretty scary. It was fantastic. Where is it?
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:55.280]   Oh, yeah. How about this? Would that be good? This is the most life-like dead animals anywhere,
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:02.800]   according to... Oh, hi, taxidermy. Poor Stacey, we ended last week's show for folks. This is kind of
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:08.880]   her ratty. I'll use it for Stacey for needing to spruce things up for right by Skype room.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.280]   You know, we could just with a little Photoshop, frankly, just put that in. We could, yeah.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.680]   That's true. I could have a different taxidermy animal each week. All of this
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:24.320]   and can change his mood color. Oh, get chucked mounted. This is oh, hi, taxidermy.com.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:30.640]   That's an... Proit from Hands-On Photography, Hands-On Wellness. And the reason that everybody's
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:35.280]   trying to look better is because look how good an looks. Look, look at that shot. Just look at that shot.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   Oh, thank you. Perfectly lit. And the person in it. He don't need no taxidermy.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.640]   You don't need no stuffed animals. I'm just thinking... I'm going to change this
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:51.360]   set more than every day. How about this, Stacey? We could put this... I'm just thinking over Stacey's
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.440]   shoulder there. Oh, perfect. Perfect. Oh, I love trash pandas. Yes. It's kind of a reclining trash
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   panda. He's got his chin on the tree stump. He's just kind of reflecting. He's looking at... Oh, yes.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:10.240]   Yeah. Never heard that phrase. I don't know. A trash panda? No, never. A.K.A. Raccoon.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.080]   But he's a flying trash panda because there's no leg on the ground. No, he's in the air.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.720]   He is definitely in the air. I would be pretty good. This is for a very tricky trash panda.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.640]   How about a badger? You want a badger? No.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.320]   I mean, that's a good reporter emblem. I will get it. Yes. You are as true.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:34.960]   Nacious as a badger. I'm really liking the raccoon. I think so. I don't think you want a lion. No,
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.320]   I was looking at an alligator. There were some caemans that were kind of like upright.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:45.520]   And I was like, oh, that gives me both height and it's kind of a skinny spot. So you don't have a lot
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.680]   of animal room. These people also offer to yourself bird matting kit if you want to.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Do they have prices? Does there have a price on the trash panda? Oh, yeah. Let's see here. Price
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:02.880]   levels. This is posted in 2016. I'm going to zoom in on this here.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:12.240]   Antelope badger is 550 to 900. Oh, shoulder mount versus full mount. You want a full mount, I think.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.880]   If you wanted to showcase the entire the tire eminal, that all sounds quite competitive on the
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.920]   pricing. I think it's very good. I mean, that's a lot of work to make those bus cocks.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:30.240]   I dam the bus cocks. I want a whole bus cocks. Javelina with an open mouth, a big horn, a wolf,
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:39.520]   bobcat bison caribou. You could just have a cow. Stacey took a nap. Jeff and aunt watched as
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.840]   long as they could and gave up. I had to do windows weekly. So I only saw the opening statements.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.840]   We're talking about, of course, testimony today in front of the house judiciary subcommittee on
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:53:02.160]   antitrust by four of the five or six big tech CEOs from Amazon. Jeff Bezos, first time he's ever
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.920]   testified in Congress, which is kind of interesting. Mark Zuckerberg, who's been there before many
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.200]   times, if Senator Pichai, who's always been kind of a favorite of Congress, I think he's always done
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:20.400]   very well there from Google, our own our own CEO. And he's not really our own CEO, but this is this
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:27.920]   week in Google. So we'll own him. Or as a Republican congressman called him, Mr. Pichai. Pichai or Pichai.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:34.720]   How could you not know who Sundar Pichai and how to say his name? That's just that's poor briefing
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:42.880]   on the part of the staff. If Mr. Pichai, Mr. Pichai. And then finally, of course, Tim Apple from Cook.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:50.400]   No Tim Cook from Apple. And actually, I have to say, I was listening, I was getting ready to come to
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.320]   work. So because it was delayed by like an hour and 15 minutes, which is frustrating. But
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:01.280]   then after all, I do the same thing. So I guess I can't expect. They're also on Leo time.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:07.200]   So now I know how you all feel. I finally said, well, I look, I'm taking a shower. And of course,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   as soon as I started gotten the shower, they started. So I was listening to all of them speak.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.960]   Then I quickly wrapped myself at a towel because I wanted to run out and live in
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.720]   room. Lisa was watching. Liverman, I want to see. This is a visual I don't really want. But go ahead.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:28.240]   I wanted to see because part of the theatrics of this, all four CEOs were on video cameras. I think
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.160]   they're all using WebEx. Is that the congressional choice?
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.760]   They have them. WebEx has some security features, I think that might be why they're there.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.480]   That would make sense. Some members of Congress were there. Some were not the chairman of the
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:49.440]   House Judiciary Committee. Jerry Nadler was not. But Jim Jordan was. And so was Chitulini.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   The Jordan's the ranking member, Chitulini is the chairman of the committee.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:59.760]   And I wanted to see the backgrounds of all four CEOs because I thought this is going to be kind
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.000]   of telling you how they were dressed. Zuckerberg kind of had a loose tie. He looked like he looked
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.440]   like he got some sun. But as one would expect when Mark Zuckerberg, it wasn't a tan. It's just very
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.000]   freckly nose. It kind of looked burnt. Of course, everybody made fun of him because he put the zinc
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.120]   on his face. Yeah, he was surfing. Yeah. And now we know why. Everybody made fun of him for
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.040]   protecting himself from sudden. Oh, that's the right thing to do. Thank you. Yes, it is.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:29.440]   And so he looked like he was at his Martha's Vineyard House. I don't know. It was like on the
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.560]   porch of his house with him. And then I was a little disappointed. I expected the richest man in the
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:40.960]   world to have something a little better. But Jeff Bezos just kind of had an office with a credentials.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.000]   That's why you're the richest man in the world. Yeah. He saves money. Well, very famous. So
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.680]   Amazon for years made their own rated Bezos. And they did a ball. Okay. You need to go. Okay.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:01.120]   Very famously for years, Amazon had desks made out of doors on saw horses. I don't know if they
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:07.040]   still do, but that was that was actually the big thing at the time. So you're right. That's why he's
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.920]   rich. So here's let's see what room raider. Very good. Let's see what room raider has to say.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   There's Jeff Bezos. And you see, it's just a credenza. Looks like it could have come from Ikea.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.360]   Not well, a little more expensive than that. But you know, and it's got a not a lot of effort put
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.560]   in dressing. And I don't think that's a real place. That's probably a nice, nice use of the rule of
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:37.920]   thirds back off the soft focus says room raider ad books. Remember books? Order a couple of ring
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:46.080]   lights. Here's one you gave it 4.5 stars, six out of 10 for a feel like. But I like that he's
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.280]   just slightly off center. I like I like the rule of thirds. And even the fact that this is a light
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:59.360]   rate behind him. This is all I think by maybe wrong, very conscious. That the idea is to make it
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:07.760]   look like an executive in the office, not not a stage set. So or maybe it's his lawyer's office,
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.920]   but go ahead. Yeah, you know, and a black suit, black tie, white shirt, very nondescript.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.600]   Didn't want to look too rich, probably Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.960]   So you can't choose a blue or red tie anymore. Because that's not it. It's not saying something.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:29.040]   Zuck is wearing a checked blue tie with a white shirt, both Zuck and Bezos affecting the rich
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.800]   man's spread collar, which of course is a Britishism that I find particularly annoying because
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.880]   anyone with taste wears a good preppy button down collar. Anyway, he does look like all about
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:46.560]   how your face is. I'm just kidding. He does look like he's got some freckles. So he's been
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.920]   in getting some sun. His tie is loose, not exactly tight. But he remember we kept him waiting an
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.320]   hour and in the green room. And I don't get the background here. But honestly, it looks like he's
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.920]   on the porch of his nantucket summer home. It doesn't. It's an odd kind of background.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   And it says the oven and it's ship lap. By the way, he's well lit. In fact, if you look in his eyes,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.840]   you can see it may not be a ring light, but he's got some good lighting going on there.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:20.400]   Hostage video, says room raider. Putin has not released him, but has allowed him to loosen his
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.080]   tie. That's nice. Two out of 10. That is as simple a background as you can get. Tim Cook.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:32.800]   Ooh, even worse. This looks like there's some dying lands. He's in the lobby.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.120]   Yeah, this is awful. There's those partitions, you know, those cloth partitions. They used a
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:45.920]   dead noise. He looks like he's in borrowed somebody's cubicle. It's terrible. And you can see in front
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:52.080]   of him. And I'm not sure why you can see a looks like an iPad. I don't know a Macintosh.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.800]   No, it's I think it's an well, it's obviously an Apple device beside it. Tim wearing gray,
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:02.000]   gray suit, light gray tie, kind of gray, light gray shirt off white shirt.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.720]   Yeah, nice. Not doing the spread color, but it's still a little more spread than Americans where
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:14.400]   Tim Apple needs some work. Plants help, but that wall needs a patch of art depth would help too.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:20.000]   I think the plants look dying. My favorite was an obvious to be curious what room raider thinks.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.400]   Yeah, Sundar Pichai loved him. Loved him this very textural sculpture or painting behind him.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:31.040]   Another credential. I wonder if that would sound baffling. It looks kind of like, you know, you could
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:37.680]   buy a textured baffling and expensive sound baffling. Also, serious dark suit, dark time,
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.000]   almost matching, but a little bit lighter gray. And the least spread of all the colors.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.920]   Well, I feel like this actually might be his office. What do you think? I feel like it almost
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   might be. No, he also has a plant room rate. Of course, loved him. Love the texture, great
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:59.360]   composition, the vase and plant are perfect strong nine out of 10. It would be 10 out of 10 with
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:06.320]   more color. You should have stuck a product, a little speaker that's coming to your
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.600]   home. Yeah, I always set that off nicely. But you know what? None of these guys, in fact,
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.480]   one of the things they all said is, Hey, what are you talking about? None of us are dominant.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:24.160]   Tim Cook was famous. He said, we, Apple is not dominant in any of the markets we participate in.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.280]   We're a small part of any market we participate in. However, that's not our goal. We don't
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.760]   want to be dominant. We just want to make the best products, which actually I think is sincere.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.200]   Well, he's not dominant, even an iPhone, he's dominant in mind share. But even in the United
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:47.600]   States where the iPhone is as strong as it's only 50%. But it's the well, the app store, not the
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.800]   phone store. And that is what they talked to a little bit about. They kept him mostly on the
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.120]   sideline. It was from what I read in the play by play, mostly Sundar Pichai, who did a lot of
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:05.280]   talking. As we already mentioned and expected, the Republican members of Congress were more
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.800]   interested. Even though this is the antitrust committee, we're more interested in bias
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.920]   any conservative bias than they were in any interest.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.760]   Because governing is hard and they don't want to do that. They just want to get all
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.200]   aggravated and get their talking. I mean, what is even?
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:32.880]   It is interesting. I know. I think that Bezos's shot was carefully contrived. Remember, he's got
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.400]   the best people, right? He is contrived to kind of blend into the background.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:45.680]   Seriously. Not really here. He's just like, I'm just on the show. Isn't that how he deals in
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.360]   general? He never gives interviews. He's very much a blend in the background kind of CEO.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.920]   And so I think that was very conscious. I think all of these are pretty conscious.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.160]   But for those tight shirts at Sun Valley, there isn't blend in at all.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   He doesn't expect anybody to be taking pictures of them at the Sun Valley.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:12.560]   Yeah. Tim and Sundar have normal collars. But the rich guys, the founders.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.520]   How do they do the rich guys? Well, the founders, they're the two. They're the founders. These guys
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.480]   are just hired hands of the four. He says the rich guys. Those are the
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.280]   guy's or just suck. Suck is so rich. He lost $70 billion in stock value over the last three
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.840]   months. And he's still the one of the richest guys in the room. That's how rich
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:41.040]   Suck is. So the founders prefer the British spread colors. That's all I know. Although I said,
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.920]   I felt like after I watched the four speeches, I felt more like Jeff. I felt like,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.440]   because all four of them were great pains to say, look at the benefit our companies have brought
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.120]   us that we are the economic tech in general, the economic engine of the United States.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.280]   It's brought huge benefit, especially during this time of quarantine. We are not trying to be
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.400]   cutthroat competitors. We're just trying to do a good job. And I felt like I wanted to wave the flag.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.680]   I felt like, yeah, I did a good job. God bless. It turns out, I didn't know this,
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.840]   but there is a Scottish Wikipedia. Did you see this?
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:28.240]   Oh, I saw the headline. I didn't get the story. So apparently this Scottish Wikipedia
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:35.280]   is being edited. But the problem is it's by a guy who doesn't speak Scottish. He's some American
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:44.640]   guy, according to vice a self professed Christian INTP furry, furry living somewhere in North Carolina.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.960]   And only only only stop. You got to do this in the accent. You have to destroy the accent.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.920]   I thought he was letting me take his hat. Well, the funny thing is,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.200]   his Scottish is about as real as mine is.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:06.240]   So here's an example. This is the first article he edited. The Human Development Index. I mean,
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.080]   it's just a simple, simple thing. I'll just blow it up.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:17.120]   "Freh, Wikipedia, the v. book, a knowledge." The Human Development Index is a composite,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:25.200]   statistic, or life expectancy, education, and income indices to rank kinders in day,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:35.440]   followers, tears, or human development. Oh my God. But that apparently is no relation to anything.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:44.560]   Oh, Scottish. Apparently, though, he's not doing it for any mean reason,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.040]   what he's doing is he'll write the article in English and then look up each word in a Scottish
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:58.400]   English dictionary and just stick it in if it kind of sort of matches. But this is the sad part.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:03.840]   He's responsible for one third of the Scots Wikipedia entries.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:12.080]   And probably nobody noticed till now. Well, yeah. One user wrote, "I find it insulting that you
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:19.200]   would pass this off as our native language, which you clearly don't speak." Again, as a native
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:25.360]   and native speaker, no one uses who uses the site as it isn't even close to resembling any
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:34.560]   Scots language. This is here on a page about the movie Million Dollar Baby. He wrote,
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.880]   "This film is a boot, an unappreciated box-entrainer."
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:49.760]   "Pinkine is a peer-to-peer payment system introduced as open source software in 2009
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:58.880]   by developer Satoshi Nakamoto." Oh, geez. Yeah. There's no indication,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.040]   according to Vice at Amarillo, that's the guy's name, Amarillo's gardener, his handle.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.160]   "Was it tempted to do anything wrong? But their work has been damaging nonetheless. On their
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.720]   talk page, they wrote, 'If I had to do it over, I would have kept too more clean up
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.880]   and just keeping the wiki up and running instead of writing articles. But I meant the best."
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.920]   It's like those old ladies who try to redo the Renaissance painting.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.880]   Yeah. Exactly. You end up with something horrible, right? Yeah, you get those smoosh
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:37.680]   Jesus. On the Reddit post, it says, "The damage done by this may be more severe than anyone
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.040]   anticipates." As a result, quote, "This person has possibly done more damage to the Scots language
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.960]   than anyone in history. Because of this cultural vandalism, it's possible many people think
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:55.360]   Scots is a horribly mangled rendering of English rather than a language of its own,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.040]   and for which I take some responsibility." As you should.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:05.440]   So now they're debating, "What do we do? If we close it, it will never be reopened."
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:12.480]   The guy was just trying to preserve Scottish Wikipedia. Oh, God.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:22.160]   Just amazing. The answer is to solicit more people, to get more people,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:29.600]   to more Scottish people to actually participate. Because that's the downside of not having enough
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:37.200]   participants in an open ecosystem. Yeah. It was apparently he was a teenager when he started doing
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:43.360]   it. The Redditor who discovered it said, "I've been told that there's been harassment going on.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.760]   Seems like a nice person who made a mistake when they were a young child. The mistake nobody ever
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.840]   bothered to correct. It's hardly their fault. They're very passionate and dedicated."
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.520]   The Scots language version of Wikipedia is legendarily bad.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:06.960]   Wow. "Blaze Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer,
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   and Christian philosopher. He was a child prodigy that was educated by his father, a
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.520]   text collector in the room." So I think the kid thought, "This is how they do it."
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.680]   Can we find some real Scottish language? Very simple of that.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.920]   They misuse common elements of Scots that are even regularly found in Scots English like
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:36.320]   "sign." "Well, yeah, me, old acquaintance, be forgot, and they're brought to mind."
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:44.640]   That's a Scots, right? Old Langsein? There's Scots language and then there's Scottish English.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:52.640]   Yeah, I don't. Once again, where's John McWhorter?
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:09:06.800]   It's pretty funny. It is. Yeah. And the funniest thing is the kid apparently was sincere.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.960]   This wasn't like some... That's not funny. That's sad. Everybody's being fiendy.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.760]   He's like Star Wars kid. My fear is that he's a Twitter fan. He's probably watching right now,
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.000]   and he learned how to speak Scots from me.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.520]   One of the things I love about doing this week in Google is getting together with three people.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:37.840]   I just adore Stacy and Jeff and Anne. And sometimes it's just a conversation about the things
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.400]   that had caught our eye or caught our attention this week.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:49.280]   Anne really surprised us a few months ago with a story about a good friend who had recently
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:57.200]   passed away. And I really... No best of would be complete without this story from Anne Pruitt.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:06.880]   Get your hankeys ready. And now I am going to yield the floor to my colleague from North
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:14.560]   Kacalaki. The right honorable. Is that how I say it? Did I say it right?
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:21.280]   You said it right. North Kacalaki. Mr. The honorable Mr. Ant Pruitt has the floor.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:33.120]   My pick of the week is I want to say thank you to Chad and I mean Chad Bozeman. The whole
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:39.200]   Chad Whit Bozeman still throws me off because I didn't know him by that name. Always knew him as Chad.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:47.520]   I wanted to put this out there because I know a lot of listeners are from my hometown of Anderson
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:54.160]   South Carolina and I felt that I owe it to them to bring this up and just share just a few minutes
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:05.040]   of what I know about Chad. Where I grew up, the house that my mother built, the land that she
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:15.280]   built it on was owned by some Bozeman family. So my neighbors were Bozeman's. And there were
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.640]   two sisters that lived there that had another brother named Chad that he didn't live with them.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.600]   But he would come by from time to time and we would all hang out together, play basketball,
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.280]   and just be teenagers, you know, just be kids and had a good time, taught the lot of junk,
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:39.360]   had a lot of fun. And Chad was special. He was a hell of an athlete that went to another high
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:45.600]   school in the area, not the same one that I went to. And just taught the lot of trash,
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:51.760]   heck of a competitor, really, really good at the sports, you know. But beyond that,
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.080]   he was an interesting kid because he wasn't like the rest of the kids that, you know,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.440]   we all had the dreams and aspirations of going pro in this sport and going pro in that and whatever.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:09.280]   But Chad was different. Chad was into debate. Chad was into theater. And he had divisions of
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.800]   of being able to go to college to get into theater. And most people in that area didn't think that way.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:24.480]   And he would get ridiculed when you talk like that, depending on the area that you're from,
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:30.240]   if you know what I mean. And so he continued to go on and I wasn't in touch with him much,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.160]   but I was in touch with his sister because again, they lived next door to us. And during this time
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:43.280]   of his passing, I really feel for her because she kept us abreast of his progress and let us know
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:51.840]   that what was going on with him. And I never really saw any of his movies until 42 with him
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:58.720]   portraying Jackie Robinson. But I heard about some of his stories of just being in New York and
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.400]   struggling just like all actors do, but he kept pushing forward. And he also had the mission of
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.080]   saying, you know what, I actually want to make the story. I want to be in directing. I want to be
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:16.960]   in the writing. The acting stuff just happened. You know, that wasn't even his main vision. His
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.680]   main vision was to just make the story. And when he got that opportunity to jump into Marvel
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:31.200]   and be the Black Panther, he just took that opportunity and just absolutely crushed it,
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.040]   considering all the things that he dealt with growing up, considering all the things that he
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.600]   was dealing with at the time. And it really resonated with me. I never go to the movie theaters. I
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.400]   hate the movie theater experience. The only time I've gone is for Star Wars. And that was because
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:53.280]   of the connection I have with my late father. But I did go see Black Panther because of Chad.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:04.480]   And when I went to see Black Panther, it warned my heart to see that. This man was a superhero.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:11.200]   And in our area, superheroes didn't look like Chad. They didn't look like me. They looked like
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:17.360]   this guy with a pomper door or just there were no Black superheroes like that. And to see
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:23.760]   that he was able to bring that to life and my kids could see, you know, there are superheroes
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.000]   out there that looks like us. We can still go out there and strive to do things beyond
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.200]   the basketball court and beyond the football field. We can go and write stories. We can go
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:42.160]   and make the story that we want to present and entertain millions around the world. And he put
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.960]   his guts into this. He was so serious about his craft. And he also wanted to make sure
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.800]   other people could prosper from his efforts as well. And I just wish that more people
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:01.680]   would could understand the backstory behind Chad growing up in that tiny little town of Anderson,
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:08.240]   South Carolina, where it's not much going on there other than Clemson football. But he had a vision
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.480]   and he stuck with that vision, thick and thin, getting more opportunities left and right that
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.640]   he had no control over it. There's the story of Denzel Washington helping him pay for his trip
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:28.880]   to go to Oxford and study acting. Denzel freaking Washington. Then he gets back and he's been told
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.200]   no a gazillion times on set because he didn't fit this role of that role. Then there's another
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.400]   time in the soap opera where he was portrayed as a Black man. But he didn't like how that role
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:47.280]   was being portrayed negatively. He spoke up about it and they took him off. But he said,
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.080]   you know what, it's okay. I still want to make the story. It's okay. I don't have to act. I can
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.200]   just write and do my own stories. And then after that, all of these other doors just continue to pop
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.560]   up for him and just keep pushing folks don't don't have ass life. We really do have a tremendous
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.080]   opportunity right now, even though this is COVID-19 and things are shutting down. If you have a passion
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.480]   about something right now, just keep going for it. Keep living it. Chad did it better than anybody
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:24.160]   that I can ever realize considering everything that he dealt with with with with cancer. And people
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:33.440]   are complaining about wearing a damn mask. Walk in his shoes. Do what he did. And just be better.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   And I just wanted to say Chad, thank you so much, man, for representing our city, representing our
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:47.600]   state and representing our people, resilient brother. I love you. And to your sister,
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.040]   I'm not going to say your name. I'm thinking about you too, because you've lost not one sibling
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:02.720]   20 years and my heart goes out to you. I love you. Thank you. What a hero. That's beautiful.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.840]   Thank you for that. And that's it for Twig. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:14.960]   Bye bye. That was really great. Wow. I didn't know you knew. Well, holy cow.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:24.080]   Wow. Thank you, aunt. That was really from the heart. It's interesting how beloved he was in such
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:34.880]   a short career. But boy, and I'm not a Marvel fan by any means, but when I saw Black Panther,
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:43.280]   it was like, wow, wow. Yeah, his sister used to send messages.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   And she said, look at my little brother, just doing it up. And I would joke with her and say,
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.000]   yeah, that don't look like the same dude. He just threw our ass in the face.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.560]   He had already been diagnosed with colon cancer when he was doing Black Panther.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.320]   We knew we knew Chad was different from from a lot of the kids that we hung out with.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:18.640]   He was likable and you know, could party and all of that stuff, just like any other teenager.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.360]   But there was something different in that whole
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:30.000]   theater life and the debate life. It was he wasn't like the rest of us and it showed.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.120]   And he just kept pushing along and it's. We should mention that the most liked tweet of all time.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:45.040]   Yeah. It was this tweet from his Twitter account.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:54.160]   Yep. Saying he'd passed away. 7.6 million likes retweeted 3.1 million times.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.400]   Well, says something too about the coverage in having covered entertainment industry.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:13.200]   It shows how not to racialize it, but white controlled media just didn't understand how huge
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:19.520]   he was until they started hearing the reaction that how profound a sadness this was.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:29.760]   Yeah, I got the message from my mom when it happened and I was like, wait a minute, no,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.400]   this can't be real. And then my son, they sent me a message because I was out.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:39.920]   They sent me a message and it just just broke their hearts and then my phone started running
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:48.160]   from people from back East just like this. This can't be real. And being able to hear everybody else's
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.880]   story, it just just further approved how much that catch is just really
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:59.680]   meant to all of us from the area. No, I didn't keep in touch with Chad. There's no way I could
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.720]   keep in touch with Chad. It's just it is what it is. And I was never upset about that. But
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.600]   I really appreciated what he represented from the area because
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:15.200]   y'all know how it is in the south. You've heard the horror stories that I've told about the south
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.400]   and this being the so-called land of opportunity, it was great to see that he was able to take his
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:29.840]   opportunities and just really maximize it. And then beyond that, give back to everybody else and
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.560]   just say, hey, you can do this too. So get on out there, do the work, get slapped in the face a
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.240]   couple of times, but just keep going at it. And you know what, you can be a freaking superhero
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:45.760]   that we used to dream about and look at on the TV screens and movie screens when we were kids.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.680]   And I never ever would have assumed something like that would have happened
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:59.280]   until seeing that with my own eyes. It's kind of amazing. Yeah. And what I think he made 42
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:06.560]   third good Marshall and Black Panther are three movies that must mean so much to Black
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:15.360]   children and just Black people in general about achievement in not just in sports, but you know,
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.160]   as a Supreme Court Justice and King of Wakanda, which is pretty good. If you can make it to King
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.560]   of Wakanda, you can make it anyway. Yeah. I remember when I saw Black Panther,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:33.360]   when we left the theater, I remember walking out of the theater and just sort of standing and
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:39.680]   just looking around and I was just taking it in. Yeah. And it was Phoebe and I at that particular
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.440]   time, it was Phoebe and I and I just stopped and we're just taking it in. People were taking
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:52.640]   selfies. Oh, yeah. It was so inspiring. It was it was it was beautiful. Yeah, it was really beautiful.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:57.760]   It was really. Thank you for your generosity. Yeah. Thank you. Not easy. Not easy to do that.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:03.120]   But thank you. You know what's fun about this week in Google, there is no lack of stories.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.160]   Yeah, if we're just talking about Google, maybe there would be. I mean, I guess there'd be a lot
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.960]   of stories, but Google, when we started this show more than a decade ago, really was, you know,
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.280]   a big player in the industry. These days, Google just is a little bit less interesting.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.080]   But to me, what's interesting is the world Google plays in with Twitter and Facebook,
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:31.360]   the internet, the intersection of technology and government, media and the new way of media,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.040]   work, everything that we deal with. That's what we deal with on a twig. And I think that
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.000]   post COVID, it's going to be a whole new world. And it should be very interesting. I hope you will
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.640]   watch or listen every week, because we're going to have a lot to say in 2021. We'll be back next week
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.760]   with our final this week in Google of the year. We'll take a look back at 2020 and look ahead
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.880]   at some of the stories we'll be covering in 2021. I hope you'll join me and Anthony.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.240]   And I call him Anthony and prove it. I say Anthony people go, who's Anthony?
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.320]   Aunt Pruitt, Stacey Higginbotham and Jafarness. That's his real name, Jafarness Jarvis.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:17.040]   Come back. Join us next week. No, it's not. Join us next week. Meanwhile, I hope you have a wonderful,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:23.920]   happy and safe holiday. Zoom your friends and family. Let's make this a very cozy,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:34.080]   wonderful holiday. But do stay safe, stay healthy, because we want you back in 2021. Take care.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.680]   [Music]
