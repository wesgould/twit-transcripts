[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.640]   This is Twig, this week in Google
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.920]   to show the covers, Google, and the cloud.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.720]   And on the line with us are regular panel of experts
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.800]   starting with the lovely Gina Trapani
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.720]   from the research triangle today.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.520]   Yes indeed.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.000]   Hello.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.960]   She's doing research.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.200]   Yes.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.280]   Research in the mass potatoes.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.400]   Yum and turkey.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   Yum.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.920]   Yum.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.800]   Good research.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360]   That's the kind of research I can dig.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120]   I can get behind.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.200]   It's great to see you, Gina.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.000]   Jeff is in his home in New York City, I can tell.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.640]   The book lines study.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.800]   Just out of focus today.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   I'm feeling a little out of focus today.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.480]   Of all?
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.960]   Yeah, well, now you look pretty good.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.760]   He's on the blue camera today, which actually, ironically,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.000]   is kind of a little yellow.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.240]   Yes.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.600]   But that's just the way it is.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.320]   We were remarking before the show began.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.040]   This is a holiday week, and I suppose next week
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.000]   will be the same, and there really isn't that much to say,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.600]   although it is the end of a decade and the end of a year.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.760]   So one of the things we could talk about a little bit
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.280]   is what a year it's been.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.360]   And a lot of the Google blogs did that, talking about what
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.840]   happened this year, are their favorite new features
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   on various Google products and so forth.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   But we could even talk about the decade,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.840]   because this is completing the odds.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.960]   And Google was started in 1998.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   It's 11 years old.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   It's 11 years old.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.760]   So most of its growth happened in this particular decade.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   So we could talk a little bit about that as well.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.160]   And looking a little forward to Google in 2010.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.960]   And now, before I get email from people
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.800]   saying, it's not really the end of the decade.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400]   The decade ends in 2011 with the conclusion of the 10th year,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.480]   the decade, because we start counting at one, not zero.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.920]   I know.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.720]   And I don't care.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.360]   You love your--
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.600]   I don't care, because if--
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.240]   It's their life.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.120]   If on the last day of 2010 we do a decade ender,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.640]   I'll get far more email from people
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   saying, what are you talking about?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.240]   They're already in the teens.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.640]   This is not the end of the decade.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.520]   So I'd prefer to get fewer mail from correct people
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   than lots of mail from incorrect people,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.800]   if that makes any sense at all.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.240]   So what are the big stories of the week?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   I imagine Google takes the week off
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.360]   like any sensible corporation would this week of Christmas.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.520]   And then next week is probably going to be equally slow.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.880]   Did anything happen at all?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.520]   No?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.120]   Besides the usual set of--
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.880]   What?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.560]   Did Google do a Santa thing?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   I didn't even notice it.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.200]   I was offline.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   I can think.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.760]   The big thing for me was the open email came out.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   Yes.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   Google open.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.880]   Well, what does Google mean by open?
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   It was decreed to the land.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.760]   Ah.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.360]   And what does Google mean by open?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   I'm looking for the darn link now.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   You know, I think it was interesting.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.440]   While you're looking, I will mention one thing I did notice
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.040]   because I was tracking Santa is that Google owned
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.640]   the Santa Tracker, forget NORAD.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.560]   It was from NORAD.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.440]   It was NORAD talking.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.480]   But boy, if you look at the mashup,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.760]   they'd had a big Google in the lower right--
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.280]   I mean, big Google in the lower right hand corner.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.200]   This is something I started to--
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   I've been doing this for years as all radio DJs did
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.800]   because even 20 years ago, before the internet,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.040]   we would call NORAD and they had a phone line.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.600]   We'd play it over the air so the kids would go to bed early
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.480]   because on Christmas Eve, as Santa getting
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.880]   tracked across the globe.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.160]   And NORAD's been doing that, I think,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.960]   for many years, 50 years maybe.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.520]   Then of course, once the internet came along,
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.720]   you were able to in increasingly less rudimentary ways
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   track Santa.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.320]   This year was a Google map mashup with embedded video
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.800]   and photos and a big Google on it.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.040]   Google bought Santa.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.800]   I think that's the big acquisition of the year.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.840]   And definitely.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.760]   What big sense takes over the North Pole?
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.440]   Everything's free.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.600]   Oh, guess who went to NORAD?
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.560]   Sorry.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.040]   You just couldn't resist, could you?
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.760]   I'll show you.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Are they still tracking Santa?
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   He's kind of done, isn't he?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   I think that's a good thing for journeys.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   The journey's done.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   Yeah, the official--
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.360]   It was NORAD, Santa.org.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.560]   So why is he going to play the music?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   Let's play.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   [HONKING]
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   Really bad MIDI music.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.160]   And he's-- Santa's completed his flight,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   come back in 2010 and see him again.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.760]   But I'll just show you.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   So that's a Google map.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.280]   But if you click on any of the video things,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.440]   you'll see the Santa Cam video via YouTube.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.480]   And if you go full screen, they did--
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.760]   I think this is Google Sketchup.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.640]   But look, you see the big Google logo on the video.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.040]   And they'll show Santa--
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.600]   Now, Santa has just been sighted off the coast of Florida.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.040]   He has finally arrived in the United States
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.600]   and into US Northern Command's area of responsibility.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.040]   See, and I think I swear that's Google--
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.480]   We still don't want to work sighted about this.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.400]   Oh, you know, they use the NORAD.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   Everybody gets a chance.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.440]   And they're not pros.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.680]   But look, see, I think these are Google Sketchup buildings
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.960]   that he's flying through.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   Wow.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.640]   That's definitely Google Earth.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.520]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   But look at the size of that Google logo.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960]   There's no question.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.760]   Google owns this one.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.280]   It's true.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.720]   Wow.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   Wow.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.760]   Pretty cool.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.160]   So Google bought Santa.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.760]   That's a big acquisition.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.160]   Eric did say they would be buying more things.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.880]   Do you think they paid for that as an ad?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.200]   Or they just said, no, you can use it,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.000]   but you just got to give us a big plug.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.840]   They probably have a ladder, right?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.000]   So this was the week Google explained what they mean by open.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   What does that mean?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.240]   Hi, Jonathan Rosenberg, the senior vice president
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.400]   of product management, put on a memo that
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.200]   tried to explain to the troops what
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.280]   was meant by open both in terms of projects and open source
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.440]   and opening up your code, whatever
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.200]   possible, the one wonders about the exceptions to that rule,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.920]   and then about open information and our data being
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.560]   open to us.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.000]   Gina, what did you think of it?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.720]   I thought it was really interesting.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.840]   I-- it was interesting.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.240]   John Gruber said that he felt that the whole thing was just
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.400]   this big pile of horse manure.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.920]   You know, Gruber has become the internet curmudgeon.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.680]   He has.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.200]   He has.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.600]   He has, you know.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.360]   I mean, they had a little jab at Apple
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   implying that the iPhone and the Apple systems
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.320]   are closed systems.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.560]   Well, they are.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.680]   It's open systems.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.400]   And I think that's what kind of Tweet Gruber--
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.760]   although Gruber made the point that there
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.080]   are a lot of things that Google is not transparent about.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.720]   Like, it's search algorithm and the way
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.440]   that it scales its servers.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.640]   But you know, Rosenberg actually did address that
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.760]   in the blog post.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.480]   So it's a really long blog post on the official Google blog.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.840]   And it was an email, I guess, that had gone out to company
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   wide.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.120]   And he said, you know, there are some cases in which being
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.840]   open and transparent isn't beneficial to everyone.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.920]   So there's a whole point in saying
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.440]   that openness and transparency and open standards
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.880]   and free data, data that can be transported from one place
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.000]   to another is good for the internet.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.320]   And anything that's good for the internet
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.520]   is good for Google.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440]   And anything that's good for the internet and Google
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.240]   is good for everyone, basically.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.800]   Because you said, you know, there are times--
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.160]   That's the greatest impression of it.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.720]   That really is the spirit of it.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   Yeah, I mean, he can't--
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.400]   It's good for GM.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.960]   It's good for America.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.880]   Right.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.400]   Right.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.800]   Right.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.680]   But he said, there are some times when being open
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.360]   isn't beneficial to all, like the search algorithm.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.040]   He basically said that if Google was open and transparent
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.560]   about what their search algorithm is,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.040]   you would enable people to game it.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.680]   So that was kind of interesting.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.840]   Now, that was Goober's complaint.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.560]   Like, oh, well, Google, what isn't
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.760]   open about the things that make it money?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.880]   But Rosenberg was saying that closed systems--
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.840]   the old way of thinking is that closed proprietary systems
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.760]   are profitable.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.560]   And so you had this kind of old school MBA view of protecting
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.880]   your IP.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   But Google's taking the other approach,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.680]   which is to be as open as possible and to help along
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.240]   the internet and help along everyone.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   He uses the internet, and that that's only good for Google.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.160]   So I mean, I have to say that--
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.680]   Makes sense.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   --you know, he points to the data liberation.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.280]   It does.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.800]   It does.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.120]   And he pointed to the data liberation front.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.480]   And a couple of other initiatives within Google,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.760]   he pointed to Android and Wave and Chrome,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.360]   all open source projects as examples of this in action.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.880]   And I have to say that I bought it.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   Here's kind of the heart of the logic.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.760]   He says, so if you're trying to grow an entire industry
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.040]   as broadly as possible, open systems Trump closed.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.680]   And that is exactly what we're trying to do with the internet.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.520]   Our commitment to open systems is not altruistic.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.200]   It's good business.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.160]   Since an open internet creates a steady stream of innovations
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.720]   that attracts users and usage and grows the entire industry.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   He quotes Hal Varian in his book, "Information Rules."
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.960]   Here's the equation.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.360]   Reward equals total value added to the industry
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.720]   times our share of industry value.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.320]   So he says, all other things being equal,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.600]   a 10% increase in share or a 10% increase in industry value
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.560]   should lead to the same outcome.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.160]   But in our industry, a 10% increase in industry value
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.200]   yields a much bigger reward because it stimulates economy
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   of scale across an entire industry.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.240]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.520]   So leverage, he's saying we get much more leverage
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.760]   by improving the internet than we would
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   by increasing our share of the market.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.400]   It's a much more valuable thing for us to do.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.320]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:31.840]   It does.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.320]   It does.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.680]   That's what you said last week, Leo, about the revolution
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.720]   we're seeing.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.960]   It's not just a powerful smart company involved here.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.200]   It's new rules.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.480]   It's just a new way of doing business that
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.440]   is made possible before because we didn't
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.240]   have the network structure to enable this.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.920]   But when you have this network ecology,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.560]   it changes business otherwise.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.400]   I blew it.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   I should have gotten Gruber on so he could
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.920]   declare horsepucky in person.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.600]   I think my favorite-- my favorite paragraph is this.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.880]   These close systems are well-defined and profitable,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.640]   but only for those who control them.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.800]   Open systems are chaotic and profitable,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.600]   but only for those who understand them well
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   and move faster than everyone else.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.320]   Yes.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.000]   And close systems grow quickly while open systems
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.120]   evolve more slowly.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.200]   So placing your bets on open requires the optimism, will,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.440]   and means to think long-term.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.760]   At Google, we have all three of these.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.640]   So they're basically explaining the reason why Google
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.080]   starts these projects that don't have immediately obvious
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.320]   business models that you can't look at and say, obviously,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.840]   this is how they're making money,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.200]   that they're going into long-term projects like Wave,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.000]   like Chrome EMOS, like Chrome and Android.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.280]   And yeah, I'm right there with them.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.080]   They can afford to.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.960]   Yeah, I remember discussions some years ago.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.840]   After six apart, first, in the early days of Moonball
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.600]   Type, decided to make that a platform
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.440]   and then have a hosting service on top of it,
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.280]   and finally started licensing the platform.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.520]   And there was a human cry because they limited the license
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.880]   so much, because they didn't want to disadvantage
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   their own hosting service.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   I remember the time thinking that the mistake was
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.400]   that they were in kind of a conflict of interest there.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.840]   They should split the two up.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.040]   Then along came Moonball Type.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.720]   I mean, I'm sorry, WordPress.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.240]   And WordPress had the dot org.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   And when WordPress got VC investment from Polaris,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.960]   I talked at the time to the folks
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.040]   from the venture capital company.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.720]   And urged them to do what Matt wanted them to do,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   which was to leave the dot org as the platform
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.960]   and make the dot com merely the first company built a topic.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.560]   And going to what Rosemary just said,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.240]   it means that WordPress dot com is faster and smarter
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.720]   than others, but that everyone who benefits the platform
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.520]   benefits WordPress dot com and everyone.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.080]   And that's just such a different way to do business.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.360]   - And yet I wonder, is it a good thing?
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.920]   I just, I'm looking at another article.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.840]   This is from the Fylo security blog that says,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.920]   "Over 60% of US state governments have gone Google.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.160]   "Is that such a good idea that one company control
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.000]   "the data for 60% of the state governments?"
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.080]   That's a little scary.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.160]   - Yeah, I don't see this all the time now.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   - It's a little scary.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   And so everybody says, "Oh, is that a good thing?"
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.320]   Well, yeah, there's danger there.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.600]   GM was big and it brought down the auto industry.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440]   - Right.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.280]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.400]   But what are you gonna do about that?
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.600]   Split up GM, would that have helped
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.480]   if Chevrolet were a different company?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.760]   I don't think so.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.480]   - I would hope that state governments
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.360]   are backing this stuff up locally.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.440]   I mean, the argument is Google now controls
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.920]   government's access to its own data.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.000]   I hope that's not the case because.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.480]   - And what is the what if?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.720]   I mean, Google gets bombed.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.560]   I guess that's bad thing.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   Google goes evil and suddenly what cuts off
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.080]   all state governments from their license-played applications.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.320]   You know, it's an easy rhetorical thing to say
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.640]   and start a conversation.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.160]   Uh oh, that could be a bad thing.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.080]   Yes, anything in life could be a bad thing.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.360]   We don't rule ourselves around that, I say.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.680]   But then I'm an optimist, cock-eyed to a fault.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.920]   - I think it's an important point, but you're right.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.440]   What is the worst-case scenario?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.040]   And I can't really think of it with some,
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   I don't know, some foreign government becomes 51%
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   control of Google somehow.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.120]   - You know, but here's what it is.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.720]   If something goes wrong, right,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.040]   then I hate to go so far off topic,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.200]   but Twitter is exploding with us just now
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.760]   because the TSA came out with new rules.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.560]   - Oh, let's talk about that.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.360]   - The test is playing berserk.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.680]   You're not gonna be allowed to pee the last hour for profit.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.280]   - P, you're not gonna be allowed to have your Kindle,
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.440]   you're not gonna be allowed to have your laptop,
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.680]   although you're right, not being able to pee,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   could be, you have to bring a bottle, I guess.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.840]   (laughing)
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.080]   - Maybe for the boys.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.680]   I would do it if I blogged in December, 2001
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.960]   that we all have to fly naked.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   - Well, you know, there's an easier way to do this,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.840]   which they do in L.L.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.200]   No carry-ons.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.400]   Just eliminate carry-ons, then you can pee all you want.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.760]   - Yeah, but the problem becomes,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   this is back to, right of, right of,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.320]   right of, right of, right of, right of,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.160]   it's back to Google.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.760]   If you make rules around everything that could go wrong
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.040]   or has gone wrong once, you're the bubble boy.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.120]   - Yeah. - Cool.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.200]   - Right, we'll soon have the pretzel band.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.400]   - Right. - Somebody tried to use
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.360]   pretzel salt to make a bomb, no pretzels.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.760]   - Right.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   What can you do?
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.000]   - Yeah, no, you're right. - Smart.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   - You cannot protect against everything.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.440]   I mean, and clearly our security on airplanes
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.400]   is all about security, theater, not about true security.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.240]   Why the last hour? - Yeah.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.520]   - Why not the last hour and a half,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.280]   one of the last two hours?
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.160]   Why the last hour?
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.320]   That's just kind of arbitrary, isn't it?
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.080]   So if I decided to blow up the plane an hour, one-on-one,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.600]   is I've done any less damage?
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.440]   No.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.280]   So it's just, it's theater, it's security theater.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.360]   We've known this, Bruce Schneider is very famously,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.560]   there's a great article in the Atlantic last November,
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.880]   a year ago, which the author conspires with Bruce Schneider,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   the security expert, to demonstrate
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.480]   that there is no security at all.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.160]   He brought in knives, he brought in scissors,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.760]   he used fake boarding passes.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.360]   I mean, it was a mockery, it's theater.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.320]   - Right, so go back to the fears about Google and states.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.040]   So should the 23rd state not be allowed to use Google?
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.120]   23's okay, 20's all right.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.240]   - I frankly trust Google more than I do state government.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.520]   - Yeah, the TSA right now.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.880]   - Yeah, let Google do airport security.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.720]   - By the way, I tweeted this,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.280]   "I'm all in favor of government blogging,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.040]   "it's a wonderful thing, but it just doesn't make me
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.000]   "feel comfy that I go to the TSA blog,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.160]   "and what's the topic, but a poem?"
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.360]   - Oh boy.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.720]   - Yeah, they dropped the ball on the whole blog.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.320]   - This is one they need to talk about, yeah.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.440]   - Was the night before travel and all through the suitcase.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   What suitcase, I don't know how to have one!
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.400]   (laughing)
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.960]   We should, okay, for those who haven't read it,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.200]   I'm sure that there will be a fewer,
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.320]   and I think Zini Jardin was the first to really,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.440]   she tweeted as she was being exposed to this
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.680]   for the first time on an air Canada flight,
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.360]   that she even said the flight attendant seemed
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.120]   very embarrassed, they said, "We've just learned about this.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   "You will not be allowed to get up out of your seat
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.520]   "in the last hour, you will not be allowed
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.960]   "to use any electronics in the last hour,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   "so put everything away, you will not be allowed
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.760]   "to go to the bathroom in the last hour,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.480]   "all due to this nutcase who set off explosives
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.160]   "on the Delta flight yesterday."
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.280]   And it's like the shoe thing, it's like,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.880]   "Well, what are you gonna wait and see what they do
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.960]   "and then ban anything that, okay, then what next?"
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.400]   It's just crazy.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.440]   - Yeah, I can't wait to fly home next week.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.480]   - That'd be very, you know, I'm curious about this.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.280]   Obviously, they'll do the minimum they could do
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.960]   without the public revolting or not flying.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.120]   - They may have been over the line on this one.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.960]   - This is-- - They may have,
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.000]   they're gonna have tire plane loads,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.160]   everyone coming in for a landing is angry now.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.120]   - Yeah, well, the word to the geeks is bring a paper back.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.200]   - Because it's that.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.800]   (laughing)
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.760]   - You know, I presume they include the Kindle
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   in the electronics.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.600]   You're not gonna be able to read at all
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.440]   unless you have something.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.280]   You're gonna be reading that Air in Flight magazine
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.120]   for an hour.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   It's about 10 minutes worth of reading there.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.160]   Maybe it's all a plan to get you to buy things
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   from that catalog.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.280]   - Yeah, a Sky Mall.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.200]   - Sky Mall.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   - It's a-- - It's a Sky Mall
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.280]   conspiracy. - It's what it is.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   - Clearly. - Clearly.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   (laughing)
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.120]   - Clearly. - The spirit.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.840]   - I'd bail out. - Yeah.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   Buy more from Sky Mall.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.040]   (laughing)
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   You know, if you look at that Sky Mall catalog for an hour,
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.160]   you're gonna buy, you know,
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.320]   some, you know, golf club that has a radio in it or something.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.920]   (laughing)
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.720]   - Someone's gotta start putting advertising on the,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.920]   on the puke bags.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.840]   'Cause, you know,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.680]   (laughing)
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.480]   they'll have a captive audience.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.080]   - Next is one, that's the Google phone.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   And I, you know, there's still these rumors
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.600]   that they're gonna sell it,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.840]   although it's invite only according to Engadget and others.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.400]   - Yeah, what's up with that Leo?
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.760]   You gotta hook us up.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.600]   - Me? - Me?
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.760]   - Like I can get an invite?
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.120]   - Me? - You gotta wave invite.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.840]   Gita, you got the first wave invite, I think.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.680]   - Yeah.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.320]   - Oh, I'm gonna, yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   Hopefully I didn't call in all my favorites for wave.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.280]   - How would you get a,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.680]   look at if the three of us can't get an invite,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.240]   how are you gonna do it?
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.200]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   Is it gonna be registered developers?
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.280]   Is it going to be, you know, I don't know.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   How are they gonna,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.960]   how are they gonna choose?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.120]   It's not like they're even,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.400]   now has Google made an official announcement about this?
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.840]   Or is this just all rumor and commentary?
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.360]   - It seems like all the announcements
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.200]   are coming from Engadget.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.440]   - Yeah.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   And now we're talking about a January 5th release date.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.840]   It's the 26th.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.960]   Don't you think that they would have said something?
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.080]   Or is this just gonna be a surprise?
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.720]   Yay, some lucky people have been invited on the 5th.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.400]   - Isn't that the Google way?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.720]   - The according to the frequencies
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.880]   that the phone is capable of,
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.000]   it's not an AT&T phone, it is a T-Mobile phone.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.960]   - T-Mobile only, so even though supposedly it's not locked,
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.240]   an S&T mobile doesn't lock you because you can go up.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.360]   - They don't need to.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.680]   Because they have, they're the only ones
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.880]   who have a HSDPA on that frequency.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.240]   900 megahertz, 1700 megahertz and 2100 megahertz.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.080]   Now listen to this, 7.2 megabits down, 2 megabits up.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.520]   If you can get that 3G from T-Mobile.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.440]   But that's in very limited markets.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.360]   5 megapixel camera with mechanical autofocus and LED flash.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.080]   Sounds a lot like the Droid, it's got Android 2.1 of course.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.320]   5 megabytes RAM, 512 megabytes ROM,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   4 gigabyte micro SD in the box, of course you could put a 32 gig in there.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:36.240]   AM OLED display, those beautiful displays, WVGA resolution.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.400]   It's similar to the Droid in a lot of ways.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   But no slide out keyboard.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.040]   - I'm in.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.880]   - I would get one.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.720]   - Oh, I'm in.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.560]   - Okay.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.640]   - I've used up all my self-discipline on the Droid.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.200]   (laughing)
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   - You never did get a Droid.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.280]   - I never got the Droid.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.120]   (laughing)
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.440]   - Well, see now I'm gonna be mad because I got the Droid.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.400]   And now I'm gonna be mad because I, well, let's see if we get an invitation.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.280]   - Okay, Gina, all right.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.520]   Now here's your psychological test for the day.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.920]   So January 5 comes the announcement that let's say February 1,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.160]   you can get the Nexus 1.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.200]   And then January, what is it?
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.880]   26 comes the announcement of the tablet.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.720]   - Uh oh.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.880]   What are you going for here?
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   Is the tablet Apple's tablet or is the tablet?
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.880]   Okay, so it's not an in-dread tablet.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.360]   - Is latest rumors there and of course, you know, it could be the fall?
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.720]   - It could be the fall.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   - Yeah, but the report is that they reserve some space at the end of January for a day.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.240]   - Oh really?
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.680]   And now everybody's talking about the fact that they have the trademark for Islate?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   - Exactly.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.520]   - I don't buy it.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.080]   - So there's the temptation.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.800]   Yeah, you know, the tablet hasn't, I don't know, I'm kind of still kind of feeling bad about it.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.960]   I think I'll go for the phone.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.240]   - This is like deal or no deal.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.840]   And Jeff, you're the Howie Mandel of Twig.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.000]   - Don't touch me.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.680]   - I say, oh, I'll take the phone, Gene.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.200]   - You know, you should go for a briefcase right now.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.960]   - Yeah, really.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.600]   Well, I don't, you know, I'm with you, Gina.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.400]   I'm real skeptical of tablet, but I just, I also don't underestimate the ability of Apple
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.040]   to come up with some very interesting, for instance, marketing things, you know, stores
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.840]   and stuff that might make it more compelling.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.560]   - Agreed, agreed.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it just from a design perspective.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.960]   I mean, I'm really interested to see what it looks like, but I'm not like dying for a
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.160]   tablet personally, but maybe they'll change our mind about that.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.080]   - I'm not dying for Nexus One.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.960]   I don't think the Nexus One sounds so much better than anything else that's out there.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   I mean, it's an HTC phone.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's probably very much like the G2.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.240]   I think the Droid is a great phone.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.280]   I'm very happy with the Droid.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.520]   I wish it had a better camera.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.920]   It does not have a very good camera, despite the five megapixels.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.520]   But invite only, how do you even do invite only at retail?
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.040]   I don't even understand how that works.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.280]   - Well, the psychology of it is obviously working on me.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.280]   - Yeah.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.520]   - The invitation part makes it even more exciting.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.080]   - I gotta get in the mic.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   How do I get in the mic?
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   Have you played with two on you?
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.880]   - Yeah, if you have a, there is a cracked two one that you could put on an unlocked Droid.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   - Oh, is there?
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   I have to do that this week.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   I haven't played with it.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.960]   I saw this very shaky screencast that just made me feel a little nauseous, because I
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.880]   couldn't hold the camera straight.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   It was very blower-witched, but it looks really good.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.000]   It looks like an incremental kind of upgrade.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.040]   Nothing, you know, that was shockingly different, but it looked real smooth and interesting.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.080]   So, yeah, I definitely want to play it with two on.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:47.720]   - I'm hearing that the UI for the Nexus One feels different, but it's still just Android,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   right?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.880]   Is anything they could have done specially for this, or is there a build, a top Android,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.800]   just for the Nexus One?
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.960]   - I think it's slightly different.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   It seems to have the major difference that I saw.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.360]   It's got a little home button that you push, and it kind of flings out the menu, and kind
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.960]   of a flashier, smoother, transitional kind of way.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.040]   I think it has maybe a little, a few more different widgets that I hadn't seen before.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.080]   - But I think it's basically Android.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   I think it's, I recognize it as Android, even in a fuzzy screencast.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   - I want to leave.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.400]   - Have you heard of anything too different?
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.680]   - No, I just wish, and I don't think it does it, I wish they had more home screens.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   Three is just not enough.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.080]   And I just don't get why they're so limited.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.200]   I know that on the, on the ARIS, there's more, because it's not a Google experience
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.560]   phone, so Motorola configured it with more.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.680]   I don't know what'll happen when they give, and I'm sure, I'm told this is imminent.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.080]   Give, push 2.0 upgrades out to the ARIS.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.280]   I just, it's, and I've tried all the homepage replacements and all of them just kind of.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   - Don't do it for you.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   - They sucky.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   Yeah, they slow it down.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.120]   - I'm excited that Mint, the financial app is announced that they'll have an Android
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   app out.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   - Oh, that's good news.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.400]   - First quarter, that was one of the ones that was, that was bugging me.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.040]   It was one of the, it was like the one app that I'd point out and say the Android market
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.760]   is not complete, because this is, this is a great iPhone app and it needs to be out.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.920]   And so, you've gone up.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.160]   - Now that, now that seismic is out for a Twitter on the, I think seismic is quite good.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   And it's free.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   So that's fantastic.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   And, uh, Evernote's, um...
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   - Evernote, I got on here.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   Yep.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   Evernote's app.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   Yep.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.780]   That just got approved and now is official and now in the Android market.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.200]   So, so the bigger holes are really filling in and I like to see that.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.640]   - Four squares on, uh, yeah.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.840]   I mean, and you get, and you get stuff that's exclusive like Google goggles.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   - Yep.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.440]   - That you can't get on the iPhone.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440]   - And Google Voice, yeah.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   - And Google Voice.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   That's right all the links.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440]   - No, no.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   Google Voice is now coming to the iPhone.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.840]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.280]   - Not officially, but there's a semi-official.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   - Mm.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.760]   - Um, what else is on?
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.320]   - Well, I wonder if it'll use a...
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   Have you guys heard about PastryKit on the iPhone?
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.680]   Just a reverse piece on that?
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   - PastryKit.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   Good name.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   What does it do?
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.720]   This is all the code names are, are pastries.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   - [laughs]
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   - Actually, it's an iPhone thing.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.400]   It's a JavaScript framework for the iPhone that makes web apps act very much like,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   native iPhone apps.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.640]   - Which is kind of interesting because it's really going to give the iPhone a little bit
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.840]   of a leg up on Android in terms of web apps.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.720]   So that'll be interesting to see.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.080]   - Now, LifeHacker did have a Google Nexus hands-on.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   I don't know if you know the guy, or Gao, who wrote this.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.200]   - Mm-hmm, Jason Chen, actually it was Gizmodo and they made a cross-
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.840]   - Oh, it's from Gizmodo.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   Okay, okay.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   - He liked it.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.640]   He says, "Thanks to a clandestine meeting with a source."
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   - [laughs]
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.200]   - Basically, it's Google's Droid Killer.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.960]   He says, "It's faster, it's better in every way."
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.120]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.360]   He says, "Slightly thinner than the iPhone, slightly lighter than the iPhone."
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   I like that.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.600]   It is a gorgeous screen.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.400]   OLED screen is nice.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.240]   - Now, is the Nexus one the first piece of hardware that Google has had a hand in designing
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.480]   besides their search appliance server thing, that yellow box they sold to business?
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.800]   - They're doing stuff, but yeah, that's the first consumer thing I can think of.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.720]   - Yeah, I think that's what I'm kind of...
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.000]   When the announcement goes out about invitations, they're not just gonna send phones to people
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   randomly.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.200]   These are gonna be invitations to purchase the phone, I assume.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.760]   - Why don't they bother with purchase?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.240]   - Why would they bother with purchase?
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.680]   Yeah, give me an invitation, give me the phone.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.000]   - So you guys think they're just gonna send phones to lucky folks?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.800]   - No, they could.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   - Get the gold ticket.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.040]   - I don't know, if you ask for the right search, you'll suddenly get a...
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   - Hey, you know.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:46.520]   - The magic duck drops from the Google's page and you get one.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.680]   - Basically, Jason says, "If Google releases this phone, they will immediately preempt
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.600]   every other Android-based phone out there.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.240]   It will be the phone."
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.760]   He says, "It beats the hell out of the droid in every single task we threw at it."
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   - Mm.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   - Mm.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.160]   - Well, here is to upset the rules of telephones.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.960]   - Yeah, you can't do that.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.600]   You know, you won't get another deal if you do that.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.400]   - But they won't need another deal.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.240]   That's the point.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   That's exactly the point.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   They wanna break those chains, Mr. Marley.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   And...
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.480]   Sorry, which is a mind.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.920]   - Yeah, that was a Christmas reference.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   That's good.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:36.080]   - Uh, uh, change the way the industry works and who else could do that but Google and
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.920]   our customer is gonna complain?
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   Not us.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.520]   - Microsoft has a very infilicitous phrase called "killing your babies."
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.720]   That they use internally only because it's so horrible.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.280]   But essentially, it's what Google would be doing, which is that in order to go to the
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.480]   next thing, you have to kind of destroy the previous thing.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.840]   And you have to be willing to do this.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.000]   And this is what Microsoft says.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.440]   You know, we're willing to undermine our relationships with Samsung and iRiver to go forward in the
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   Zoom, that kind of thing.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   - You know, I think you're right, Leo.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.480]   You know, look at how television has done better than newspapers because networks we're
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.080]   willing to just tell their affiliates to buzz off.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   - Screw you.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.480]   - And we're gonna stream online because that's where the future goes.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.640]   Sorry, tough nuggies.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.360]   - Now, again, it's tough nuggies economy.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.760]   - The tough nuggies economy.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.280]   - That's a much better phrase.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:35.600]   And gadget does have a review from April of a Samsung with an OLED screen powered by Android.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.080]   But I haven't, that hasn't been released.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.200]   The Samsung 7500, have we seen that yet?
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   That would be a three-level as well.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.880]   - I think what this announcement was, we're hardware people.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.760]   I think that the revolutionary thing here is not going to be the phone itself.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.200]   It's gonna be the model, the business model.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:59.280]   - All right, we're gonna talk about pastries and I guess it's pastry that's allowing the
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.480]   Google voice app to come back to the iPhone.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.920]   This voice central happened just a bit before we go on much.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.320]   I wanna mention CES is coming up and we're gonna be going to CES in style thanks to Ford.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.440]   And we're gonna have a great Lincoln.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   I think it's the MKS with Ford Sync Equipped.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.920]   So when if you're coming to the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas in two weeks, come say hi,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.280]   I will give you a personal demo of Ford Sync.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:32.040]   Sync is the amazing hands-free Bluetooth, music search, media playing, information system
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.760]   in the new Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles that allows you to do things like ask for weather
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   reports.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.600]   You never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road though.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.240]   That's what's beautiful.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.560]   You don't look down at a screen, it tells you this is the five-day forecast.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.680]   This is what the ski report is.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.280]   This is what traffic conditions are.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.000]   And turn by turn GPS built in to all Ford Sync.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.040]   Of course every Ford Sync has an audio connection and a USB port.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.600]   So if you've got a droid, for instance, you hook up the droid to the USB port, it sees
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.840]   the droid, it puts the songs on its index and now you can call for songs by name.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.440]   If you've got a too deep peed built in as you do on the droid or the iPhone, the 3GS,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   you can get in the car and it starts playing immediately.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.080]   You can control it from the phone and I listen to my audio books, they stop when I get out
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   of the car, they start up again when I get in.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.840]   It is simply put the best and going open, they're going to have an SDK, there's some
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.360]   big announcements coming from CES from Ford.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.600]   I'm told, I don't do embargoes so I'm not on the list that can see what these are.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.760]   But people are saying, "Wait a minute, you see, wait a minute, you see.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.360]   Sync is amazing.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's the new platform in Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.880]   It's kind of like Hal 9000 in your car without that whole lock you out of the pot bay door
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.600]   and all that thing.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.320]   Go to sinkmyridepodcast.com to find out more or just visit your local Ford, Lincoln and
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.960]   Mercury dealer and say, "I want a test drive sync, Ford Sync."
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.680]   We'll see in Vegas, we're going to be talking to the CEO Ford and the chief guy behind the
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.920]   designer behind Ford Sync and we're going to get the scoop from them on what's new in
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.000]   sync.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.400]   Voice Central was an application that was yanked from the App Store when Apple pulled
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.480]   the Google third party applications and Google voice's Google's own Google voice application.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:26.880]   The company behind Voice Central is coming back with Voice Central.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.720]   They call it the Black Swan Edition.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   It's browser based.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.800]   I don't know if they're using pastry.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   What is it?
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   Pastry Kit.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   Pastry Kit or not?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.880]   I can't find confirmation that it's using pastry kit but it is going to be using HTML
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   5 local caching.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.120]   It's going to be a pretty advanced mobile web app.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.840]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.040]   I think HTML 5 is going to make this all mood because you'll be able to do everything
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.240]   in the web and so forth.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.560]   Is Safari on the iPhone a good HTML 5 client though?
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.080]   I don't think it's perfect.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.760]   I don't think it's quite all the way there.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.480]   I know Google Wave will say that mobile Safari isn't totally compliant.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:18.880]   I think it checks for HTML 5 but at the same time I have seen, actually John Gerber did
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.480]   a pastry kit kind of demo.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.680]   There's an iPhone user guide that uses pastry kit which stores the data locally.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.320]   If you look at the user guide once and then you disconnect your iPhone or iPod touch,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.840]   you can go into your settings and you'll see the local store of the database of this user
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.160]   guide and browse it offline which tells me that mobile Safari is definitely doing at
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.800]   least offline caching of HTML 5.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   That's pretty hot.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   Wow.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   Very interesting.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:51.320]   Which is what the best HTML 5 client must be Chrome right now, right?
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.840]   Or can you not say best?
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.880]   I mean, well Chrome is WebKit, right?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.680]   So WebKit is Safari.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   That's true.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   And Safari and Chrome Firefox isn't WebKit, right?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   Nope.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   Nope.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   It's got Gecko.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.600]   I think Firefox is right at the front of the line as well.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.040]   So I'm not sure if there's one that's best.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.880]   I'm not sure if there's one browser that fully implements HTML 5 yet to tell you the truth.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   It does make sense now the Chrome, the Google Chrome thing because if forwards HTML 5, it
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.280]   kind of forces everybody to support HTML 5.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.720]   You can't let Chrome leapfrog you.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.680]   So again, this is kind of that open strategy.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   Well, we don't want to own the browser marketplace.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.920]   We don't care.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:39.320]   What we want to do is forward standards and HTML 5 is a standard that is critical to Google
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.840]   to going forward.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:46.120]   It's a great HTML 5 demo of YouTube that doesn't have any flash in it at all.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.240]   And that's got to be the future for YouTube is no flash.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   Yeah, let's hope.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:56.560]   It's interesting how the tech community has started to kind of turn against flash.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.920]   Maybe not started to maybe always has, but with the vulnerabilities again and again in
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   flash.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   I mean, this thing is a security nightmare.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.600]   The amount of CPU cycles it uses.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.000]   I mean, it basically pegs your CPU.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.720]   And yet it's ubiquitous.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.880]   I mean, even Google uses it.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.720]   But there's this kind of growing, I noticed this growing demand, this tension for getting
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   away from flash.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   What can we do?
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.480]   And then from the content side, for my non-geek side, it's always the show off tool.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.520]   I'm going to control this in every way I can.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.640]   It's like the early days of not doing text, but doing GIFs.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   It's the same for flash.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.560]   And it's overused in content like crazy.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.360]   And even though Google can search it now, it hurts your Google juice.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   It just takes time.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   It's dumb.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:47.360]   So I'm told by the chat room that the HTML5 demo for YouTube does not work in Firefox.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.920]   But it does work in Chrome, of course, and apparently in Safari.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.280]   I'm going to I'm trying to load it right now.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.840]   If I get it loaded, I will.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.640]   I'm trying to load it in Safari.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   This is it.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.400]   This is this is a Google YouTube HTML5.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.040]   This is a YouTube page that has no flash.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.320]   And it's all rendered using HTML5 and 03D.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.880]   And it looks just like YouTube.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   It's got all the controls.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   And that's Safari.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   You've got there, right?
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   That's Safari.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.400]   It's got all the controls.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.960]   It looks like the full screen doesn't work.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.600]   But it's high def.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Nice.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   So I think you're right.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   I think WebKit is the key.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.840]   And HTML5 will replace gears, right?
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   Gears is dead.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   Dead, dead, dead.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   OK.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.080]   So what is the status now?
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.440]   So I still use gears on some of my Firefox.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.040]   But they're not going to support it anymore, Gina.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.600]   What happened to Gears?
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   They're letting the sun set on it, quote unquote, which means that some of the apps
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   still use it.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.560]   Like they just they just graduated offline Gmail from labs.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.000]   And that depends on Google Gears.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.280]   So it's so so things are still going to work with certain apps.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.520]   But I think they're going to move apps off of it.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.280]   And they're going to kind of let it, you know, die eventually.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.400]   I think that's the plan and to transition everything to HTML5.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.920]   But I think right now we're in this limbo, right?
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.400]   Where browsers don't fully support HTML5, you know, and Gears was kind of this thing
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.080]   that Google had developed.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.320]   So I think that Gears is going to slowly kind of ease its way out as HTML5 comes in.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.240]   So, but you know, major things still depend on Gears like Wave and like Gmail.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.120]   I mean, offline Gmail anyway.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   Now, the interesting thing about this voice central thing using HTML5 is it's still going
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.920]   to be a paid app.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.880]   So they're so now they got to now Apple's really got a problem because now they get developers
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.760]   putting apps on the iPhone charging for it and Apple gets nothing.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.440]   Oh, so this is going to be a P4 web app.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.480]   According to TechCrunch, Apple won't get any revenues.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.560]   It's just a mobile website.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.440]   I guess you subscribe, right?
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:59.680]   It'll offer offline caching, takes advantage of the HTML5 features of mobile Safari.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.180]   Huh.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.120]   That's where it goes.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   That's where it goes.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:11.800]   Yeah, and the thing is the developer Gphone and the way he explains it to me is that you
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.320]   can't buy the apps because you don't necessarily have a phone account through which to buy
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   them, right?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   Right.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.600]   So you do it in the browser.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.760]   You do it just as you would any other paid service.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.960]   This is where Chromium goes.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   Right.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.720]   So again, it goes back to what we said a few minutes ago, it breaks the business model
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.560]   of not only of telco, mobile telco, but also Apple, new business model of the iPhone,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   the app store.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.000]   The app store is dead.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.640]   Apple's kind of hoisted with its own puttard though because they're the ones who didn't
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.240]   want to put flash on the iPhone.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.200]   They wanted to kind of support HTML5.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.840]   In fact, they were the ones that when the iPhone was shipped said, we're not going to
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   offer regular apps.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.200]   We're only going to offer web apps.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   Right.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.640]   So I don't know why, but they, I don't know.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   You can't really look into Steve Jobs' mind and see if at that time he was thinking, well,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.560]   we're going to do an app store, but we're just not ready yet.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   Or if he came to the belief we needed to do an app store because when the iPhone came
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.800]   out, there was no app store.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   There were no apps.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   It was all web apps.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.600]   And he said, he, I mean, you never know with Steve because you know, lie through his teeth,
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.680]   but he said at the time, oh, who needs apps?
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's all going to be web based.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   He was right.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.600]   Here too is the paid media model versus the ad supported media model coming into conflict
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   here.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   Wow.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   Walmart.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.760]   But that's the Japanese monster movie we're seeing in Tokyo Bay now is again, it's a
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.480]   clash of business models.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:49.600]   The Apple stock went up $6.94 per Christmas market value, $188 billion bringing its stock
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   over $209.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.960]   Of course, Google is what?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.600]   Over 600 now.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   Yes.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.000]   It's just it's funny money.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.960]   But it is very I mean, that's very interesting.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   Boy, that's incredible.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.760]   Mark, so you're really seen that we think Apple's this cute little thing.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   Huh?
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.920]   No, it's a clash of two tight.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.040]   Yeah, to control or to dictate rather what the business model of the web is going to
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.600]   be, I think.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.200]   And where does and with and with their Microsoft, I guess withers the word.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   There's the word.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   There's the word.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   They're not even in the game anymore.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   It's like, what about Microsoft?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.440]   What do you think of Microsoft's cloud strategy?
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.720]   You know, look, they've got, I want to call them Aussie Osborne.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.760]   They've got Ray Aussie, who is the guy who invented Lotus, who's, you know, their cloud
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760]   wizard.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.160]   They've got Azure, which is their cloud platform.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.520]   They've got Windows Live.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.680]   They've Office 2010 is on the cloud is, you know, much like Google Apps.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.720]   But for some reason, they just don't seem as a cloud company, do they?
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   They don't.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   It's really a cloud.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.480]   It's more like a cloud in the bottle.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.320]   Oh, I like it.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.080]   You're saying it's not open.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   That's us.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.840]   What's things where we want to in this amorphous thing?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.480]   Microsoft says, no, no, no, no, no, come to our cloud.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.280]   We own the cloud.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.160]   You can't own the cloud.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.560]   Now Bing is doing better every month.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.760]   Bing is somewhat of a threat to Google.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:23.600]   In fact, I just put the Bing app on my iPhone and it's exactly like the Google app.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.120]   It has, you know, speech voice.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.240]   Not as good, but it has voice.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.440]   It has images, maps with turn by turn.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.800]   I mean, well, actually not exactly turn by turn, but you get directions.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.200]   You know, Microsoft, at least is trying.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:46.160]   But the thing that Microsoft doesn't have, I mean, they're just too slow, right?
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.200]   They're too slow and they also don't have user trust.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.160]   Like when I was reading that blog post about openness, it occurred to me that like the
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:58.360]   essence of Google's business is user trust in the brand and scale and like their ability
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.240]   to just roll things out fast to respond very quickly to what people need and get it out
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   there.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.720]   Microsoft is playing catch up.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.880]   You know, they screwed up everyone's trust with Vista, right?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.680]   And with a lot of the Windows products, I mean, not a lot of the Windows products, but Vista
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.360]   wasn't, you know, really didn't go over well with the mainstream consumer.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.080]   And they're just super slow.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:29.880]   There's a website, the chatroom's given me a website, Bing-VS-Google.com, Bing versus Google.com.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.120]   Can't choose default search engine.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.360]   Want to compare Bing and Google results?
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.840]   Get your query in the box and press enter.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.600]   I'll put Gina, Trapani, press search.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.800]   And we get two sides.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.720]   It's the on the left, Gina's Bing, on the right, Gina's Google.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.560]   I have to say the Bing is prettier.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.840]   You've got pictures right at the top.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.960]   But it's, you know, let's see this.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.200]   It looks like the same results.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.960]   Your website, GinaTrapani.org is first.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.600]   Bing's got your Facebook next, Google's got your Twitter next, Bing's got your Twitter
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   next.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.320]   Google's got smarter where?
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.880]   Smarter where it's pretty far down on the Bing results.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:13.160]   In fact, it's, it looks like it's not even on the first page on the Bing results.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   Shocking.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.440]   James Fallows, the editor of the Atlantic.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   I love him.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:23.200]   Or the editor of the Atlantic was a piece on, on the media this week, the NPR show or,
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:31.040]   or I guess last week prior and tried to write a piece, research a piece using only Bing.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.560]   And the, about a third of the way through, he said he started cheating and you said
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.320]   sort of how fine that the first was.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.280]   And in the end, he said, he was okay, but he said, Google was far better.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.360]   But I think the bigger thing is this.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.240]   I think that Microsoft is fighting yesterday's battle.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.120]   They're, they're now, as Gina said, they're slow.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   They're finally figuring it out.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.600]   Oh, search the thing.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.160]   And meanwhile, Google was now moving past search.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.400]   That's five years ago.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Mm hmm.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   It's true.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   That's not.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.840]   Google's going to give up search or, or grant it to Microsoft, but it's not where they're
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   thinking about it.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   Google ground is.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   No, I think you're right.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.200]   Google has the scale and they have the head start.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.720]   I think that this is what Google's all about.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.760]   I realize is the head start and the computing power.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.720]   Like as well said, Gina, speed and scale are up.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.040]   And it's hard to, to hard to grab them.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.720]   Again, you can always do what they do.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   Right?
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.400]   There's nothing so far.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.840]   There's nothing terribly secret.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:32.360]   You know, no secret sauce really about the end result, the edge uses.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.280]   What's behind the scenes, maybe that's different.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.800]   Maybe the scale they have there.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.080]   But that's just because they're so big.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.760]   They have to do it well because they're just gigantic.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:47.600]   So David Pogue notes in his New York Times blog a couple of days ago, Pogue's posts,
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.920]   owners of Blackberries on the Verizon network woke up one day last week to find they could
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.640]   no longer specify a preferred search service in the search box on Blackberries browser.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.520]   It's Microsoft's Bing or nothing.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.640]   Microsoft paid Verizon half a billion dollars according to the register to again, who cares?
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   It's like fine.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.080]   So wait a second, if you have a Blackberry, you can only search with Bing.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   That's what we're saying.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.200]   On the Blackberry browser, you can put another browser on your Blackberry Opera has a browser
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   and so forth.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:27.560]   On the default browser on your Blackberry Bing is half a billion.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   Come on.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.240]   That's hard to turn down.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.360]   You know, here's the other thing.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.720]   What a waste of a half a billion is what it is.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   Microsoft.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   Pardon me, go ahead.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.440]   The bottom money that they're spending to try to win search to win yesterday's battle
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.760]   is huge.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.720]   That's half a billion dollars.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.080]   One little thing.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.640]   And what a waste.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   Because who cares?
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.440]   Does a Blackberry still work?
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   Nobody's using.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.840]   I mean, yeah.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.360]   I mean, even that battleground that is that is I mean, look at the Blackberry still the
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.840]   number one smartphone probably in the in the US.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.440]   However, it does sure doesn't feel like the future of smartphones, doesn't.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.920]   Now, and this is why when I hear that Bing's market share is going up, I automatically
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.580]   get cynical and think, well, I'm sure that's because of some Microsoft like, like move
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.580]   on.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.980]   I mean, the way for being is the default young search on IE or something.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.020]   I'm sure they pulled some kind of move that made that happen versus actually people switching
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.100]   to Bing because they think it's better.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   But I don't know.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   I'm right.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.380]   Back to the to the bubble and and, you know, use your VC money.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.980]   Use your cash to buy if you could buy people.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.900]   But more importantly, who has the best free food in the cafeteria?
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.380]   That's what really comes down to.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:49.780]   According to an article in Gawker, a string of cutbacks of threatened Google's status
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.460]   as a veritable Shangri-La of free gourmet food.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:57.260]   Meanwhile, Facebook is ramping up the dining perks.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:04.700]   The Times suggests Facebook might be the new standard bearer for corporate sponsored dining.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:11.580]   Francis Dinkle spiel, a tour of Facebook's HQ cafeteria.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.300]   She writes, let's see.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.700]   Fred Labby, a credit analyst who arrives at 545 AM to reach the European market, says he
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.100]   ate at least two meals a day at Facebook.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.460]   The food is fantastic.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:30.260]   As he's savored a plate of scrambled eggs and a bagel smothered and glistening pink locks.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.900]   He put on four pounds in the past six months.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.260]   They call it the Facebook 15.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:42.260]   I want to see data on cholesterol comparisons at Facebook, Google, and maybe that's how Microsoft
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.260]   will kill the others.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.260]   It's funny.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:50.780]   I have a friend who was a corporate chef at, where was it?
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.620]   I think it was at Lucas, I believe.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.300]   Really, this is true that this is like the status symbol in a really successful company
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.460]   as the corporate food, especially with geeks, because you don't want them to leave any lunch.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.460]   It's an hour out of the day.
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.300]   If you can get them to eat lunch at their desk or at least go to the local cafeteria
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.420]   and eat faster, you're better off.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:15.620]   I maintain that the most innovation is happening by freelancers eating PB&A at home.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.020]   You're absolutely right.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.100]   Speaking as one, you're absolutely right.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.300]   That's where it's happening.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.700]   Talk about fat and happy.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.780]   No innovations coming out of there.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.020]   But boy, they do eat well.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.420]   We've all eaten at the Google cafeteria, right?
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   At the restaurants.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.220]   Oh, have you eaten there, Gina?
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.220]   Have you eaten at Google?
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.220]   I've eaten at Yahoo.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.220]   I have not eaten at Google.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.820]   I went to a Google event and they had a barbecue out on the lawn.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.940]   Yeah, they have that event.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   I missed that event.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.260]   They have that event every year for journalists.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.980]   But no, I've eaten at the Kristobona and invited me over once a night in the cafeteria.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.180]   It was sushi and just mind-boggling, wonderful food.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.220]   It's all free.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.300]   But I wouldn't like it.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.900]   I would get so fat.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.700]   They don't want you to leave.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.340]   I really think that's it.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:10.200]   In fact, I hear at the Twit Cottage, we have a refrigerator which I'm stocking with
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.020]   with delicious coffee drinks.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.660]   Because I realize free caffeine is the single best thing an employer can offer.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.660]   That's true.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.660]   Just keep caffeine.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.660]   Yeah, just keep them caffeinated.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.380]   We've got an espresso machine already, but I want to make it even easier.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.420]   Mountain Dew and Frappuccinos for all.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   See?
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   See?
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   Nice.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.420]   I like it.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   See?
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   Free oatmeal.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   Oh, nice.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.160]   I remember when I knew tech TV.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.340]   TV was done when they took the oatmeal out of the cafeteria.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.020]   It's like, what can that cost?
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.580]   Pack it oatmeal in the cafeteria.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.380]   And it keeps people at their desks.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:56.180]   It's not good for you to live on oatmeal, but you could.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.660]   So let's look back a little bit at Google in 2009.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:04.900]   This was an amazing year for Google.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:12.640]   Gmail offline, Google Earth did added space and the oceans latitude.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.200]   It hasn't really taken off.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.560]   That's their location based service.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.720]   We watched the Google books fight go back and forth.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.880]   It wasn't anything new, but that that's been the big fight.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.400]   Chrome was out earlier than this year, right?
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.800]   But the Chrome OS is new this year.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.280]   Wave is new this year.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.820]   What else was new this year?
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.660]   I've got the blogoscope.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.660]   Is it the one you're going through?
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.140]   I'm looking at some of the things on here.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:46.420]   A lot of these are just little things like Google's venture capital fund.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.420]   Right, which has started investments.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   It did one last week.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   Did they?
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   These aren't acquisitions exactly, right?
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   These are just investments.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   What's the difference?
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   They don't own a controlling stake.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.420]   Right.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.420]   Okay.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:06.780]   Google's social news gadget.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.880]   A lot of its little stuff, things like the duplicate button that we talked about last
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.320]   week, Google translator toolkit.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.320]   Wave was huge.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   Wave was huge.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.560]   That was probably the big announcement.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.800]   And Chrome OS, although we still haven't seen it, that was just an announcement.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   Nothing came out.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Well, Android this year.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.760]   Android grew up a lot this year.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.000]   Absolutely.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   It became serious.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Data liberation front.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   We talked about that.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Last week.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Side wiki.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Oh, there was a stinker.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   That's the thumbs down one, right?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.180]   Oh, there's go the new programming language.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:47.000]   I mean, I don't know how much traction it got, but still notable.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Programming language.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.360]   I mean, yeah, it's a big deal.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.200]   The sheer volume off it is what some price is.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.640]   It's a long darn list.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.420]   I mean, a lot of its little stuff, but it's it goes on and on.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.680]   This is in blogoscopes.com, the Google official Google.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.760]   It's the unofficial, I'm sorry, Google blog.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.060]   It is a long darn list.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.880]   Was this the year that Google goggles almost forgot that?
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.860]   Was this the year that speed became important for Google?
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   I think so.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.860]   This is when they decided to get fast.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   And lots of developer tools.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.260]   Lots of developer tools.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:26.100]   You know, it's interesting because a lot of these were released in the last two or three
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.100]   months.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.020]   We noted that the last couple of months were huge.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:36.420]   And it's probably the last week, we talked about the last week, but I start to see it
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.820]   all coming together.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   Mm hmm.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   Singularity here.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.820]   Serenicity.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:50.420]   You use Google's device on Google's OS with Google's DNS to Google's browser, Google's
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:56.620]   advertising, Google knows where you are, knows who you are, knows the context which you're
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.620]   asking in question.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.100]   So we can answer the question showing intent before you even ask it.
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.100]   You know, it all starts to come together.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.980]   I wrote that in the column for The Guardian and I got some predictable email of again
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.980]   people saying, "That's scary."
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.100]   Well, that's an emotional response, not a rational response.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.100]   What though?
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:19.900]   I do think that what do you think Google's net reputation change is in 2009?
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   Positive or negative?
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.900]   I think it's a great question.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.900]   I think it's negative.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:27.300]   And I think it's Google doesn't understand why or what to do about it because they don't
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.380]   understand the reaction to huge, the reaction to success.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.860]   And they should have, I think, when I was out there in January from my book event, it
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.740]   was the one question they asked me about their PR.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.620]   I think they were aware of it and they don't really know what to do about it and they still
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:50.060]   don't because they just keep on doing the, you know, Google, we're here to help routine
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.700]   and they don't understand what to do and people don't like them.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:58.860]   So, you agree, Gina, as a geek, as a coder, Google's reputation, not a net negative this
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.860]   year?
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.460]   So, wait, are we talking about mainstream users?
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.460]   Are we talking about--
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.460]   Well, that's the question.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   I mean, you're--
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.660]   I think that you're right, Gina, because I think what I'm talking about is media impression
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.380]   partly because media doesn't like them.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   I think mainstream users--
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.380]   Okay.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:19.580]   --re
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.340]   geeks feel about Google.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.300]   I think co-coders and geeks love Google.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:29.300]   And I think mainstream users also, I think that the reputation is mostly positive.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.300]   Mom loves Google.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.060]   My mother doesn't go, "Oh, Google, they're scary now."
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:37.220]   No, I was having dinner with some friends who were not in tech and one of them said
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.860]   to me, "Google is amazing.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.060]   I was typing into the box something I was searching for and it told me what I was just
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.820]   about to type before I typed it."
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.820]   You know, she was talking about that.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:46.820]   That's a big thing this year.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:47.820]   The success.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   Autocomplete got much better.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.820]   Yeah, the autocomplete just I'd suggest.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.220]   And with results right there, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.020]   That might be the single most important thing they did this year from the point of view
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.260]   of the normal user.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.260]   That's what they see.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.260]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.500]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.740]   But amongst the coders and geeks, I think it's been positive.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.860]   I mean, I think that so many of the tools that mean that the three major releases this
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.460]   year were open source.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.220]   They're releasing unbelievably cool tools for web developers from Google Web Toolkit and
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.940]   the Speed Tracer and Speedy and Wave.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.820]   I mean, these are all super cool geeky toys.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.180]   I mean, they have me.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.500]   And I think the general consensus is like, this is amazing.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.660]   We live in the future kind of feeling.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.900]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:36.300]   The question I have back is that if, however, Google's enemies and those who fear Google,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:41.340]   which is, I think, again, emotional, get enough of a PR movement going against it, could it
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.660]   hurt Google in some ways?
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.580]   In government lobbying and the idea that Google's too big, I mean, I wonder whether there's
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.980]   because the world loves them or they leave themselves vulnerable and they're left flank.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.380]   How about the Google books debacle?
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.980]   Did that hurt Google this year?
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.420]   I don't think anybody really understood what was going on.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.820]   We barely could figure it out.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   It took us eight episodes.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.820]   Right.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:06.220]   Some jank who was told me, don't talk about that on the show, Dad.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.220]   Really?
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.220]   Nobody cares.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   Nobody cares.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.380]   His generation doesn't.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.380]   No.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.780]   But I think that we do need to talk about it because I think there are consequences.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.620]   As we learned about it, as we understood it better and as understood the consequences
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.940]   of it better, I think it became apparent that it was an important issue.
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.500]   It's like talking about tax code.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.780]   I think Google realized they went over a line.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.260]   They crossed a line.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:37.380]   Well, and the line was that they controlled something too much.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:40.340]   They put the cloud in the bottle and for them that's not good.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.620]   Because they are so huge, they can't have an excess of control where people will get
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.500]   nervous and will start really shooting at them.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.220]   And so hosting the books, even though no one else did it and they thought they were
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:55.140]   doing good and I think they were doing good, they got too far ahead of themselves and they
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.620]   have to start thinking more politically.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:04.300]   Yeah, maybe this was a coming of age for them in terms of managing their reputation.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:08.940]   I think they were a little innocent and naive and maybe realize, oh, we can't just kind
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   of do it because we know it's the right thing to do.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.220]   We've got to consider other stakeholders.
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.380]   Right.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:20.180]   I think that's an issue for them because there can be damage somewhere down the line.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:26.660]   I think you and Jeter are exactly right that programmers and people like them.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.180]   Business partners will never figure out what to do with them.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:30.180]   It's tough negotiation.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.660]   It's what I've said about newspapers is that Google's mistake was trying to make friends
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.900]   with people who only want enemies.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.100]   It gets through with a lot of areas.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:44.620]   I think they risk a lot of hassle in the EU.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:51.620]   The Europeans are anti-American in some quarters and anti-big in some quarters and they have
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:55.580]   the regulatory environment to be able to try to do something about that, why they should
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.060]   is another question.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:03.020]   And so you have the French case on the books, you have the Italian case this week, you have
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.780]   the EU threatening to go after them.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.540]   I think it's very intriguing.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:15.940]   I have to say, I think this is a case of, I truly feel like Google was kind of this innocent
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:20.540]   giant and stumbled into something and said, "Oh."
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:28.300]   And now with this, for instance, this Rosenberg blog post is clearly and Larry's New York
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:36.260]   Times op-ed piece, clearly an attempt to kind of patch this up a little bit.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.260]   And kind of fix the problem.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.820]   Well, I don't know if that's even the case.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.580]   I think Gina said it well before.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:47.060]   It really was just an expression of the way they've been acting and it shows their philosophy.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.820]   I'm not sure that there was any, some wondered cynically whether the Rosenberg thing was
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.020]   a PR move.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.020]   I'm not so sure it was.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:59.180]   I think it was trying to reset perception with reality they see inside.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.460]   Gina, do you think so?
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.980]   I think that there may be trying to be more open about their internal culture.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:09.020]   I think that it seemed like they were kind of secretive about their very own culture for
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.380]   a while and I think they're just trying to practice what they preach.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.620]   I mean, if that email really went out to everybody in Google and they said, "Oh, hey, we thought
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.980]   maybe we'd put it out on a blog post as well."
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.420]   Yeah, I think that it's a matter of them just trying to practice what they preach and put
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.420]   it out there.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.420]   I don't know.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420]   Maybe I've drank the cool.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   I think we've watched it.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.420]   I think the magic people are saying.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:31.700]   I can just imagine the chat room is saying that I'm just such a Google shill at this
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.260]   point that I'm secretly getting paid.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.580]   I'm waiting for my Nexus One Google.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   I think we're trying.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.260]   I think that's the way I go for you.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:44.500]   We are trying very hard to be balanced, but I think on balance, I'm trying to hate Google
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:49.860]   and it's very hard to because for some reason I believe Jonathan Rosenberg when he says
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:50.860]   these things.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.860]   I don't think Larry's...
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.700]   There's a lot of issues in another company come out with that kind of statement.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:59.700]   No, and if it's sincere, it's remarkable.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700]   No one would...
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.300]   Name another company where that could have happened.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.300]   Yahoo, no.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.300]   AOL, no.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   Microsoft, no.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.300]   Son, no.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.940]   No other company has that kind of philosophy about what the world should look like and how
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.180]   they're going to help it do that.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.900]   I want to believe.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.700]   Google's like Santa Claus.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.060]   I want to believe.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.140]   That's why they bought them.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.140]   That's it.
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.620]   I mean, and I think somebody like John Gruber, and we'll get them on.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.620]   We'll get them on next week.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:34.380]   Somebody like John Gruber, who is like maybe John Devorak as well, kind of a paid cynic,
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.580]   has decided I'm going to be skeptical and it's good.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.580]   We need people to be skeptical.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.580]   It's good.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580]   We need skeptics.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.260]   We need smart skeptics.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   Absolutely.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.180]   I try to be that, but...
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:49.220]   But you see, that's a different colored glasses.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.500]   You got rose colored glasses and you got brown colored glasses and I think they're both
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.500]   glasses.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   And it's hard to know what to use this.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   I'm going to let you also look at the rest of the company through those glasses.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.180]   If you take Rosenbergs memo and now put it against their business practices, I don't
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.260]   think it looks so good.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:10.420]   There's no reason they have to be as opaque as they are about their splits and how that
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.420]   operates.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.900]   Again, you'll think about how the advertising algorithm works to the extent that you don't
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.900]   want it gamed.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.100]   I agree with that.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:22.900]   But there's a lot that could be more open there and they are dangerously opaque, I think,
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.900]   in their business dealings.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.540]   Yeah, I think it's great that they did this post because we can hold them to it.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.500]   So when they're not practicing what they preach, we can call them on it.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.260]   And I think that in a lot of ways they really did practice what they preach.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.660]   I love that they're releasing such major open source projects and pushing ahead protocols
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.860]   like Speedy and with Wave.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.220]   I mean, they're trying to reinvent some of the major protocols that run the web.
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.820]   And then when they do stuff that's shady, we can say, "Hey, this thing that you said,
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.540]   how does this apply here?"
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.820]   And he was asking for people to call them out on it, basically.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:59.500]   So in the post itself, so I think it's all responsibility to do that as much as I want
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.500]   my Nexus One.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.500]   Oh, come on.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.500]   You're not that cheap.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.140]   You're not that easy, Gina.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.820]   You wouldn't sell out for a silly phone.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.460]   No, I certainly would.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.940]   I was totally just kidding about that.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.300]   Yeah, but I'm glad they put it out there.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:16.460]   PR move or not because now they've set out what the mission is and now we can hold them
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.460]   to it.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.500]   It's what I've always said about the Don't Be Evil slogan.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:26.220]   If that had been etched over the doors of Wall Street and insurance companies, it might
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:31.820]   have inspired a few more people to hold their companies to some standards.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.820]   Right.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:34.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.820]   I think it's a great argument and I think it's something that we're going to continue
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.180]   to watch and we're going to do our best, of course, to be objective about it and bring
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.100]   in people like John Gruber to keep us honest.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.940]   But I have to say my leaning at this point is towards trusting Google because they're
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.340]   doing so many great things.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.580]   And we just trust but verify, keep an eye on them.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.200]   Well, the other thing about it is that I argue to people who are not sure what you
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.180]   about Google, I would say exploit them.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.860]   Use everything they give you for free.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.860]   Use everything they can.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:08.380]   Now, the argument is you've only gone into their spider's web.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.500]   But I think we're all smart enough to figure out how to use data liberation using the
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   industry.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   Exactly.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   Back stuff up.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.180]   Yeah, you don't have to trust them forever.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.700]   If you want to start a new blog business, you can put Google ads up, you can drop them.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.700]   Right.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700]   You can use great Google ad looks.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.460]   If you don't like what it is, you can always buy a stats package.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.540]   Use this stuff to your own advantage.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540]   Right.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540]   Yep.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:38.300]   And the good news is that Google is kind of in a way as setting a standard that other
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.260]   companies, let's hope like Amazon and others, will adhere to.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:47.060]   And then we can use them in conjunction to kind of balance it.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.580]   I'll show you in fact, my tool of the week does exactly that.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.620]   Let's you back up your stuff onto Amazon so that you have, you know, they'd all have
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.420]   to go bad at the same time.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.940]   Speaking of Amazon, if I can go back to the earlier topic I just saw on Twitter, I put
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:06.020]   it up on the on the front feed, you know, Verner Fogle's the CTO of Amazon linked to
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.340]   how to be a Kindle terrorist.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.620]   Oh, I mean, I keep using your Kindle even on the airplane.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.620]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.860]   Is it just like turn off the wires?
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.260]   Put it the Bible.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.660]   No one will F with you.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.140]   Oh, that's good.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   That's good.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.060]   And I don't think anybody yet has figured out how to be, how to do anything bad with
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.060]   the Kindle.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.300]   It's too primitive to be how to be a Kindle.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.900]   Well, except for remotely deleted books.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.900]   Right.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.180]   Well, Amazon might have, but we haven't.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180]   Right.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180]   Right.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:42.340]   If the terrorists are as innovative as Google, then we're in trouble.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.340]   That's funny.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   That's funny.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.780]   It's only a matter of time before people started putting up posts like that.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.540]   I'm sure there'll be a lot more this week.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.700]   And we will cover it next week.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.580]   It might be a slow week next week, but I think this would be a good week to kind of look
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.180]   ahead to what we would like to have Google do in 2010.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.620]   So we'll prepare our notes on that for our next episode.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:05.420]   Meanwhile, time for our tip tool and number of the week, starting as always with Gina
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.740]   Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.740]   Okay.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.620]   So I have two tips of the week and they're both really light.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.140]   It's the last week of the year.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.980]   So it's a good time to change your master password and just kind of do a little inventory, every
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:23.660]   most important web apps and other places where you enter passwords and change your passwords.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.220]   It's always good, a little extra security.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.500]   Make sure your password's up to date.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   That's a good tip.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.940]   And then my other tip is last week of the year, a lot of people have some time offs,
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:36.260]   but some time with loved ones, log off and relax.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   No, sorry.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.260]   No bad tip.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.580]   Wrong, wrong.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.180]   Still not, cannot, does not compute.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.180]   Log off and relax.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.180]   No.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.180]   Me, I should have played out on Twitter.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.180]   She's not on Twitter.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180]   Where's coming?
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180]   What happened?
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.420]   Gina, are you there?
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.940]   Did you really log off?
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940]   Just log off and relax.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:04.140]   I'm going to spend some time actually interfacing with other humans, human to human.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.140]   I will interface with other humans.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.140]   Humans.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   Humans.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.140]   I bought eyeballs.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.140]   Humans.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   I am interfacing now.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.140]   All right.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.140]   Well, good luck.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   Your family loves you.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.900]   No, they, they, no, my family's response to me is who are you?
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.020]   Where's your blackberry?
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.180]   Up the screen, burn, heal a little bit.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.860]   Actually, my kids, the viral video of the couple who got married.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:35.340]   And at the end of the ceremony, before they kissed, he pulled out his iPod and the ministry
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.460]   explained that he was updating his Facebook status.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.300]   Oh, that's actually very romantic.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   Can I find that touching?
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300]   Aw.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.260]   The Kyrie, you got a good laugh.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.860]   That's pretty cute.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.860]   No longer single.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.340]   Yeah, I like to get that sweet.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.660]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:07:01.100]   Well, factual.com, which is a wonderful open analysis platform for any kind of large data
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100]   pools that are out there.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:08.940]   Got a whole bunch of data from Common Crawl, a nonprofit group that has a crawl of sites
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:13.100]   and then can all of those stats against four million sites that they crawl.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:17.660]   So 28% of those sites have Google Analytics on them.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.660]   12% have AdSense.
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:26.940]   5% have either a Twitter or Facebook link and 2% have both a Twitter and Facebook link.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.260]   I'm surprised that number is so low.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.260]   Wow.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.660]   Well, I looked at the actual data and of course, there's a lot of porn there.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.700]   So you have to do the report exception.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.980]   So the 28% use in Analytics, I found interesting.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:47.540]   That means that Google knows intimate details about almost a third of sites on the Internet
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.940]   on their amounts.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940]   Wow.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.540]   That's amazing.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:59.220]   My tool of the week now, actually, I want to do a tool of the week responding to you
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.300]   specifically, Gina.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.380]   No, I won't do it.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.380]   I won't do it.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.380]   No, what?
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   I'm not doing it.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.260]   What was, oh no, I forgot now.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.580]   What was it that you were talking about is getting offline.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.300]   I've blanked it all out.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.020]   No, I'm going to show you how to back up your stuff online.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.220]   This is a great service.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.100]   It's free through January 31st.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.500]   I think you might have mentioned.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   Have you any of you mentioned this?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.500]   I can't remember.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.140]   We mentioned it last week just briefly, but I think we discovered it from the chat room
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.140]   on the show.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.740]   And I've signed up since, and one of the things I like about it is you can back up on their
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.780]   service, but you can also use Amazon's S3 if you have an S3 account.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:41.060]   So back up a five backs up your Twitter, WordPress, Facebook, delicious base camp, Google Docs,
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:45.340]   Gmail, Zoho, Flickr, Photo Bucket, all your social networks.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:51.060]   In other words, not stuff on your hard drive, but stuff that's on the internet that you
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.700]   don't currently have backed up.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.860]   And I like this idea of being able to back it up to S3.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.180]   That makes me wonder, Gina Leo, I have a student in my entrepreneurial journalism class
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:06.140]   who's got grant money for a super secret project to kind of organize the data you have.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.540]   I'll say no more.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:12.420]   But if you took all of that stuff in the backup of I, could you then do meta analysis against
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   your own data?
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.620]   Oh, I presume so.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.620]   I don't know what you know what I.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.500]   Is it in formats that doesn't have to look?
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:26.300]   I believe it is in fact in in standardized formats because Kevin was saying that it was
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.660]   the metadata was there, right?
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.340]   Didn't he say that that was that was there?
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:30.700]   Anyway, I just want to say it works.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.180]   I will look at my backup of my account and see if it's kind of in standard form that
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.540]   we could then, you know, parse and pervert your friends.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   I think it comes back in XML documents.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.540]   That's what I think.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.220]   You know, pretty very possible for programmers.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.420]   Leo, do you have to give backup of I the passwords to all your accounts in order for it
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.660]   to do its export or does it mean it?
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.660]   Does it support?
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.660]   Does it support?
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.660]   Oh, it's a supporter.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660]   Yes.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.660]   No, it supports OAuth.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.660]   So if you have OAuth, it'll support that.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.860]   Well, so this is the part that freaks me out a little bit.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.300]   Do you have to give it your Gmail password to log in and get your get your mail?
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.740]   I don't remember.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.900]   You give it your Twitter account.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.980]   I don't remember.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.220]   That's a good question.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.300]   I will find out for you.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.740]   I set it up and I didn't make a note of how well I you know what I give people my passwords
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.460]   all the time.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.860]   So I don't try this at home.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.980]   I should have I should have paid more attention to that.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.100]   I gave up on that a long time ago.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100]   So that would be a concern.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.260]   No, that would be that would be a real concern.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.460]   I'll tell you next week.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.460]   I'll go back and look.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.380]   I'll just need to check it out.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.380]   And it looks really good.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.900]   I just the idea of giving up all my passwords gives me the willies.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.300]   But remember how we avoided men.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.380]   Yeah, we avoided men for that same reason.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.380]   Yeah, I did.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:56.020]   There's a new there's a new Philip Kaplan the guy putt who did you know, F company has a
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:02.500]   new service that I'm a beta tester on called Blippi in which you give it all of your credit
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.660]   card Amazon and everything accounts.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.340]   And then it's it's Twitter for your purchases.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.660]   So so it tweets everything you buy in effect, not on Twitter, but it actually tells the
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.220]   world what you buy.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.940]   And then which is weirdly compelling.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.860]   You follow that's a lot like beacon.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.460]   But done with but your control now they use the same.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:29.060]   They use whatever the wufu back end that mint uses.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:33.940]   So I feel comfortable doing that when you set up your accounts, you know, they're not
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.180]   keeping that information.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.100]   Wufu does.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.060]   So you can give it your Amazon iTunes, Zappos, Netflix, Blockbuster, GoDaddy, Wine Library,
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.140]   seamless web credit debit or bank account.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.540]   And then it it it it it affected tweets, everything you buy.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:53.340]   You can follow people comment on their purchases.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.260]   It's a really interesting site.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.220]   It's in private beta right now.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.060]   So I, you know, I'm just kind of like giving up.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.380]   Can we see your your your purchases in your Twitter stream, Leo?
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.940]   No, it doesn't tweet them out.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.980]   Although I imagine that's just you have to be on Blippi to see what I bought.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.540]   But it's but it's boy.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.540]   I'll tell you what.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.540]   Talk about monetization possibilities.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.300]   Yeah, I mean, that's got that's got a whole lot of cash written all over.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:27.220]   For instance, somebody on there bought a Twittering scale weight scale and and put point out
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.540]   that five people have now bought that scale ever since the first guy bought it, including
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.420]   me and put.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:36.260]   So watch for my weight to be tweeted soon.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.260]   I couldn't resist.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260]   Is it?
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:42.460]   Yeah, I mean, so it's a Wi-Fi enabled scale that that you program with your Twitter account.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   That's so cool.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.980]   So is it so you put it on the network and you and there's like a web interface, like
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.380]   you can figure out like a router and you give it your credentials?
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.380]   That's awesome.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.780]   Every time you weigh yourself, it tweets.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:58.980]   So I have a new account, Leo's underscore scale and and because I'm on a diet, I thought,
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   you know what?
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.980]   This is a good way to be accountable, right?
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.020]   It's tweeting every time you weigh yourself.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:04.940]   I love this like biometric stuff.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.940]   Isn't that great?
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.940]   And it does.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.260]   It gives you Leo's underscore scale and it gives you there's nothing on there yet because
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.020]   I haven't got it yet, but it gives you a I'll get it on Monday.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.460]   It gives you a graphs and stuff.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460]   It's actually a very cool scale.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   Okay.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.460]   That's awesome.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.460]   Okay.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.300]   You see why now people buy that I fat.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.300]   So then there was a little contest going on to see who could have the smallest purchase
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:28.220]   and I found one penny HDMI cables on Amazon.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.220]   Oh, cool.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.500]   So I've got a thousand people.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.740]   I think bought those.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.740]   So wow.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.740]   Social shopping.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.740]   Social.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.700]   Pud's very smart.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.860]   Social shopping.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.340]   I remember seeing Pud speak and he said the key is to create a site that once you set
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.100]   it up and it goes, it runs itself.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   Everybody posted all the content.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.900]   He just sat back and collected the revenue.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.900]   I think he's got another cool thing is that I saw somebody say a user of it that, you
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:59.500]   know, his three credit cards, he designated one for Blippi.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   Yes.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.660]   And that's that's his public credit card.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:03.660]   That's what I did.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.380]   You can see the Blippi credit card company soon.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.980]   Oh, man, he's going to make a lot of money.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.340]   So when you want to advertise a purchase, you use your Blippi credit card.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.580]   You have sharing capabilities.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.220]   You can say, don't share this.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.540]   There's some privacy stuff, but that's exactly what I did.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.540]   I didn't register all my credit cards because I don't want them to see my porn accounts,
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.180]   but I registered the one credit card.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.940]   I know every time I buy something with that, it's going on Blippi.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]   Cool.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.940]   Interesting.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.740]   There was, I had a response to your idea to get off the web, but I forgot what.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.220]   I forgot what it was because I think mainly I blanked out your whole, your whole thing.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.220]   Get off the, what is he?
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   I don't remember that.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.220]   She said, get off the web.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.220]   Dude.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220]   I don't remember.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.060]   Actual conversation, not on Skype, but no.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.060]   No, I was Twittering.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.940]   I had a little walking around his house with his headset on.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940]   My kid.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   Pretty much.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.940]   That's it.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.940]   Terrieta Mike.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:02.940]   That's pretty much it.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.780]   My kids, that, you know, they say put down the iPhone.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.540]   They really do.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.540]   Sad.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   It's because they care.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.540]   They care deeply.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540]   I'm addicted.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.020]   What can I say?
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.020]   Hey, thank you guys.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.020]   Happy holidays.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:17.060]   It's been a great, wonderful beginning to our show.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.740]   We're on a 22nd episode, which means we've been doing this for about five months now.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.740]   Almost half a year.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.460]   I'm sure I speak for Gina when I say thank you for starting it and having us all.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.460]   Oh, we love it.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.460]   Thank you.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:30.380]   It's our huge, it's a big hit on the network.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.740]   And it's just really, it's so much fun to do.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.500]   And I know our audience loves it.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.580]   You can now watch it on YouTube.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.580]   Thanks to Jeff.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.180]   We are putting full-length versions up there.
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.180]   It's not instant yet.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.180]   It's still being done manually.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.780]   Soon it will be as quickly as possible migrating from the show.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.820]   Editors to YouTube also on twit.tv.

[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.140]   As we all do, I guess, Gina Trapani.
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.180]   I don't spend in public.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.300]   The more public, the better as far as I'm concerned.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:18.220]   Gina Trapani is at smarterwear.org, even if Bing doesn't know it.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.100]   And her book, that's amazing.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:26.340]   And her book is the complete guide to Google Wave is at completewaveguide.com.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340]   Bingo, yes.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.340]   I've never had any.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.340]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340]   Thanks everybody.
