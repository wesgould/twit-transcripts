[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.900]   We are here to talk about Google, the cloud, the Googleverse, all things cloudy.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.980]   The Gene of Japan is smarter where it.org.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.860]   And part of the new ThinkUp, ThinkUp.com, how's the fundraising going?
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.100]   Fundraising is going really, really well. We're in the upper 900s now. We're trying to hit
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.060]   1000s, so check out ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.620]   But yeah, it's going great to be here.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.820]   Also here, we normally Jeff Jarvis would be here, but he is unfortunately stuck in basil.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.940]   Switzerland. And the internet quality was terrible.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.820]   So, hey, we got somebody great though for you. Matthew Ingram from Gigalm is here.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.820]   Hi, Matthew.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.820]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.780]   The boxing glove is still on the doorknob, just in case.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.620]   Don't make me use them.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.620]   Just in case.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.420]   So, I don't really know what to make of this. I think it's kind of fascinating.
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.140]   Google's Motorola division, makers of the Moto X phone, pushed something onto my phone
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.580]   today. They started pushing it out yesterday. And I think it's, I don't think it's on another
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.940]   droids. I think it's only on the Moto X. And it's an animation they made with former Pixar
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.340]   animators that is designed to be played back on a smartphone.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.140]   And it's very interesting. Now, this morning when I got up, there was a little red hat
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.380]   bouncing around all over the phone. I mean, it wasn't like just in, it was everywhere.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.460]   It was down in the buttons and, and you couldn't miss it.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.380]   I played the video, but I'll play it again.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.380]   Did you know what it was, Leo, when you saw that?
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.820]   I had somebody had said on Google+, a couple of days earlier, "Install this thing." And
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.180]   you'll see why. And then I'd see some articles, but I wasn't really quite sure what I was
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180]   going to get.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.540]   So, but I know a friend saw it and he tried to uninstall it or get rid of it. Right.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.020]   Several times and it kept coming back. He didn't know what it was.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.500]   Right. Yeah, I don't think they told anybody. It's kind of like a little serendipitous surprise.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:45.020]   It's an animation made with John Pinkava called Windy Day. And I'll replay it. So you tap
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.660]   the hat and then you get something kind of odd. See, there's that hat. That was what it
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.620]   was like, a little red hat floating around. Let me turn up the.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.100]   I got to pop your home screen. Yeah. Okay.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.020]   And then it's accelerometer enabled. So as I turn, this is going to be kind of hard to
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.340]   play back, but I can look up. I can look down. I can look left. I can look right.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.220]   Is it 360? Yeah. And eventually you'll find, I don't think
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.220]   I'll be able to do it on camera. There's the hat. Some really great, I don't know if this
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.380]   is Django Reinhardt or just a Django Reinhardt clone, but some really great Django music comes
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:33.420]   up. And there's a little mouse. So does it play when you stop moving?
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.660]   If you if you don't find the mouse, it doesn't start. Okay. And so you find the mouse and
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.740]   you'll see I have to follow the mouse to follow the action.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.460]   This is a really interesting use of a smartphone for for a animated short. And it's a by the
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.300]   way, it's a Pixar quality animated short. It's a great animation.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.100]   Turn away and then come back. Yeah.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.700]   And in fact, there are parts of this where you lose the mouse and you have to find him.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.580]   And the action does not proceed until you do. Can you interact with it? Other than?
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.580]   No, I don't think so. I keep tapping and stuff. The problem is I there's no way I can show
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.420]   this on the show because you actually, I mean, can you show me? You literally start doing
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.460]   this to watch it. You're turning around. Oh, there. Oh, I just found. Oh, now I can't
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.740]   show you. It is a very personal experience.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.220]   So what did you install the other day to get there?
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.540]   Well, I don't even know if I had to. I think it just arrived without instead. Matthew,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.940]   did your friend just showed up? Yeah, it just showed up. So I knew that something was coming.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.620]   So I installed an app called Moto roll. Let me see if I can because it was the weirdest
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.420]   thing. It was the weirdest thing because when I when did you see the hat flying around?
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.020]   When I installed the app, it disappeared. It didn't show up in my apps listing. So I
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.020]   didn't know what I couldn't launch it. I couldn't figure out. It was like Motorola
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.020]   Animator, Motorola player, something like that. And then and then a widget showed up in my
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.580]   widget list that was this little hat. So I put the widget on the desktop. It didn't
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.020]   turn down. I didn't need to because when the when the when the when the oh and see now
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.580]   it's installed again, it does it after you play it. It installs it again on the desktop
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.620]   so that you can replay the movie. There there is a this is called spotlight stories. What
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.780]   happens when our engineers get together with Oscar winning artists? You get a new kind
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.540]   of story in the making. We can't wait to show you love Moto X and presumably they're going
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.620]   to be more of these.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:45.140]   I believe he wrote about it and wired. It's really interesting. So the fact that they
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.220]   would invest I mean, they've clearly invested a lot in this. This is part of their marketing,
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.140]   right? I'm sure this is included in their half billion dollar marketing budget because
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.460]   the only can do it on a Moto X.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:06.380]   I was actually wishing that the Nexus would do it. This is super cool. It is cool. But
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.460]   okay, it is really cool and I love I love Pixar shorts, right? But do I want something
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.340]   flying around on my home? No, no, if you're if you're a grump, the first thing you tap
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.500]   it and you can disable it immediately and uninstall it and it'll never bother you.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.660]   You can say don't show this time. I don't want to see this. But if if you I wouldn't because
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.180]   I I think now from now on, I'm going to get serendipitously new stories every once in
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.180]   a while.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.420]   Yeah. And can you say show me this later? I'm curious but yes. I just did that. I just
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.140]   did that. And now what it does is it puts then a widget on your table and so I mean your
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.660]   desk. So who doesn't love a red hat? Add shark cart and then no more ever. Please don't
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.460]   play. You can uninstall it. I'm just I'm curious about my mind, of course, goes directly
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:04.260]   to the sort of technical implementation of a of an app that can run itself and have permission
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:11.780]   to run over the install itself. It's install itself and then launch and run have permissions
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.140]   to run over your app right over your home screen file over your home screen. So it's a virus
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.980]   but it's a bit like a virus attractive virus. It's a really attractive virus. It's a really
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.380]   cute virus. I just like as an app developer, I'm going to make an app that can that can
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.700]   float above my windows above your existing windows. Like I have to explicitly like list
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.180]   that as a permission, which is requirement of my app and then you as a user when you
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.180]   install my app have to accept that that's okay. You're not but but Moto Motorola's not
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.700]   is bypassing all of that, right? And installing this thing on your phone and then running
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.420]   it. I mean, I think that's the part of this that I'm a little bit like it's really cute,
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.860]   but I wonder how many people are going to react the same way my friend did where they're
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.580]   just going to think what the hell is this stupid hat because they don't know and it
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.220]   doesn't really tell you and so they'll just get irritated and I mean, that's not a great
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.540]   experience. I could totally I understand completely understand what you're going to say what
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.660]   you're saying and agree with you. And I also could see the guys doing this going, come
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:18.380]   on, just a little fun. It's just a way to make you smile. Don't you trust? I mean, that's
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.580]   the problem is that it assumes that you have to you have to trust them, right? And I do,
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.660]   you know, when I read about it and wired it, it's a fascinating like the funny thing is
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:35.900]   we've had these capabilities for what years now and yet there are very, very few applications
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.740]   like that are that are trying to take advantage of those things to sort of do something interesting,
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.660]   not just to track your footsteps, but to do something sort of different in the way we
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.340]   interact with information or entertainment. Well, and that's the other thing. That's exactly
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:58.220]   what my reaction was. Wow, why isn't anybody done this before? It's almost your it's virtual
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.980]   reality. You're looking through the screen and you're and there's points in the movie
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.060]   where you're you know, there's something going on and they wait for you and you're like,
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.340]   where are they where'd they go and you find them? I think it's trying to imagine imagine
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.620]   that kind of thing on Google Glass. Yeah, fascinating. If you could overlay something
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.940]   like that on your real surroundings as you move around, they're calling this a new artistic
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:27.340]   medium and I don't think that that's unfair because they have to design this animation
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.660]   within open world, basically. Yeah, it reminds me of Chrome experiments. You know, when we
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.020]   say when we see those HTML5 experiments that take advantage of all the sort of rendering
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.940]   and graphics capabilities and whenever I see those Chrome experiments, I think, why aren't
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.420]   more people doing this? Why don't we see more people rather than the Google team showing
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.820]   off what's possible, you know, which is the point, right, of things like Chrome experiments
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:54.300]   is to show developers, Hey, this is something that you can do. And so this kind of reminds
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.620]   me, but what is this exactly? We say what technology is this? Is this a special Motorola
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.980]   based player or runtime thing? It's a Google moonshot. We're actually it's a Motorola moon
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.340]   shot. Yeah, it's not clear what the technology is. It's from their advanced technology and
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:16.220]   products group, okay, which appeared with Motorola at the same time as Google bought
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.340]   them. So it was, you know, Google inspired and they hired the director of DARPA. Yeah.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.500]   Okay, so now I'm really going to be grumpy. I got it. It's a very cute video, but it's
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:35.260]   not a moonshot. Well, I don't know, Gene, if you invented a new medium of artistic expression
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.180]   that was that could that required a accelerometer based smartphone with I think that's that's
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.260]   kind of interest. I mean, I don't think that that's non trivial. Okay. Yeah, maybe not a
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.900]   moonshot. Well, right, there's there's not trivial and then there's moonshot, right?
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.060]   There's a difference, but yeah, no, I agree. And I think it could be handled much better.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.100]   I think they probably should have made this opt in in some way, you know, say, send that
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.660]   send everybody an email saying, Hey, you have a Moto X phone. Would you like to participate?
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.820]   Maybe they did and I didn't see that, but I don't think they did. Yeah, I mean, but
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.980]   we see that accelerometer based kind of exploration in Google Earth and Google Maps. I mean, we've
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.660]   seen that before. I mean, I think it's it's a feed of animation. It's a really it's really
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.740]   cute and really cool. But, you know, I don't know the moonshot thing just jealous. You
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:28.340]   don't have a Moto X. I know. I apologize. Not the grub. You know what? You know what
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.380]   it makes me think of though. Maybe it's because it's a mouse, but it makes me think of the
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:38.100]   first days of, you know, steamboat, Willie Mickey Mouse when he was just hand drawn animation.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.260]   And you imagine how far we've come with that and what Disney is capable of doing now. Just
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.820]   imagine like this, this same type of thing except five years from now, 10 years from
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.500]   now, you know, devices like Google class and whatnot. It's I think it could be pretty
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:01.900]   amazing. It's very intriguing. It's it's it's they call it an immersive short. And it is
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.540]   immersive because you have to you're looking around. I'm surprised games haven't done
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.300]   something like this. Well, I was actually what it reminded me of or not not the game,
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.660]   not this, but there were some guys at MIT that were trying to overlay. I think it was
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.140]   Quake or something like that on your actual surroundings. Right. Good. We're a
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.660]   violent reality kind of thing. Yeah. There's a lot. I think there's a lot of that going
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:31.460]   on in the world. I thought this was great. And you know, it's funny is you can't show
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:38.300]   it. I cannot show you. You can't show it on a web page. It's it requires. I have experience
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.900]   that myself. So I mean, it looks really delightful. It looks like they really did pull off like
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.620]   a kind of fun delightful experience. It's very Pixar. It's very Pixar. Yeah.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.460]   Sounds like they spent a ton of dough on it. Must have spent a lot of money on this because
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.780]   I got the guy who didn't ratatouille or whatever. Yeah, the co director ratatouille. Yeah. So
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.540]   when you get to the end, is there a call? Is there any sort of call to action or share
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.060]   this or anything like that? It's just a short and then it's only call to action. In fact,
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.400]   this is the call to action. Right here is what pops up after you've played it once.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.680]   Is anything replay the hatsuits you add shortcut? Oops. Sorry. And please don't play this ever
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.420]   again. Uninstall those are the three. There's no share this. There's by a hat or anything.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.740]   Yeah, there is a learn more page where you can read more. You can disable it on learn
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:32.620]   more page. I mean, there's a privacy policy attached. It says, and I think this is good,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.760]   Motorola spotlight stories. That's what this is called. Do not deliver ads to your device
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.080]   or access any of your personal information. Yeah, they'd have to be very careful about
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.160]   that, especially if they're going to install it without asking you. Yeah. Well, now somebody
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.840]   in the chat room says, and this may be true that it's pre installed on the Moto X, but
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.440]   you have, but it's so uses it. And I installed the app, but apparently I already had it or
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.140]   not. I don't know. Oh, I see the Motorola spotlight, spotlight player is actually in.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.520]   It's in the Google store. In the Google, is it a play store? Yeah, I went in compatible
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.900]   with all of my devices. Yeah. Whoops. You have to have a Moto X. Yeah. I think it's a very
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.700]   interesting way to sell at a specific brand. Because no, you know, I mean, I think there
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.540]   are definitely some people who will like Gina say, well, I don't want that. And but there
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.380]   are also some people say, well, that's kind of interesting. Can I see that? No, you have
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:30.180]   the Moto X. Well, I'm really interested to see what, you know, what they come up with
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.100]   in the future, like what other sort of things they can do. It's it's a mixed bag because
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.580]   I'm completely understand what you're saying, Gina. And I agree with you. This is I think
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.340]   they're probably could have been handled better. There should have been some explicit opt in,
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.540]   but I think I understand what they want. They wanted to surprise. They wanted to and
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:58.500]   this is this is this is kind of a marketing idea. Just kind of pleasant surprise pleasantly
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.780]   surprise her. You know, unexpected, serendipitous kind of joy. I wonder what kind of responses
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.860]   they're getting from users. I don't know. This is just happened. So I haven't seen a lot
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.860]   of people sharing it, but that's partly because probably a lot of people don't have a Moto
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:25.380]   X. I I I for one like it. I'm happy I have it. And I can't and I hope that they every month
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:33.260]   or so give us a new one. It's a it's an attractive virus. Well, and to be interesting, if they
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.540]   let you interact with it a bit more, maybe do like a I know I've been to your own adventure
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:43.020]   and of course they could. In fact, it could be location aware. Could you have you tried
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.500]   Google's ingress? Yeah, I played ingress for a while. Chad's played it too. Did you stop
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.260]   playing Chad? Chad, yeah, it's it's it's a lot of work. Pondre is a lot of work. Yeah,
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.620]   Pondre is way into it. He travels a lot. He travels a lot. He I mean, he he says he's
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.660]   lost weight because of it. The problem is that Chad and I are pretty much stuck in Petaluma.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.420]   And what ingress is is this game you have to get an invitation. I think you still do
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.260]   to play it. There's a good Google group about it. If you want to read what people are up
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.740]   to you install it on an Android device. It uses location awareness. It uses augmented
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:25.260]   reality. You go to I think it's always public places like in Petaluma, it's the post office.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.460]   Right. It can't you have to collect these and you have to take them over. You you hack
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:35.820]   these nodes. There's enlightened and resistance. Right. You join a team at the very beginning
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.220]   and you're fighting for these places. So if you're enlightened, you go and resistance
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.900]   controls it. You and others have to hack the place to take it back and you can expand expand
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.260]   your territory by adding other places and then the territory boundaries are defined by those
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.740]   places. It's I signed up. I signed up and I get the emails and stuff, you know, and it
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.220]   says, here's your assignment and you have to go and do this thing and then but I'm busy
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:06.820]   doing something else and then I'm it's interesting. So Robert uses it plays a lot. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.780]   I mean, it's I was very intrigued by it. It'd be great if you were on a bicycle and you
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.540]   lived in say San Francisco or New York City. You might play it in Brooklyn, Gina, when
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.180]   you move because yeah, then there's all these other spot and you go around and it's probably
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.540]   much more active. It's not so good in a small town. I like the location aspect. Now again,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.180]   there's very few people sort of experimenting with that. It's an innovative game. I mean,
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.980]   something simple that they could do with a short like that is I don't know if you guys
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:37.260]   noticed, but when you launch Google now, the header image is contextual. So like I live
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.100]   near near near the beach. So like it's sunset. I'll actually get a picture of, you know,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.620]   sort of a pink sky and sunset. You know, I'll see like the water when I'm in New York.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.460]   I see a cityscape. It's they clearly have morning, nighttime and daytime images. You
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.980]   know, they're just they're just header images. They're just, you know, cartoons and I and
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.380]   I feel like, you know, like right now you're just getting, that's the standard California
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:05.740]   California. Yeah. Yeah. Google doodles have showed up there. So sometimes some of the
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.260]   Google doodles will show up there. I don't know what the criteria are. They could definitely
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.740]   do something like a background that's dark or light or sunset or whatever. Then in the
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:21.180]   background of the of the hat, the windy windy day video is in this car is ingress, which
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.220]   is based on, you know, your actual maps. I mean, as I mean, actual like Google Earth
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.860]   or Google Maps integration would be awesome. But like it's all there, right? I mean, with
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.020]   Earth. All the pieces are there. Yeah. Yeah. All the pieces are there. This is I just
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:40.060]   it's so cool. If you were a kid, this would be magical to you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.700]   at a I was can't wait to show out of the stuff. So you have to you find the hat and you go,
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.780]   it's what's what's going on. It's almost like mist or something. I don't know. I just I
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.540]   can't really show you guys because if I tilt it and aim it at the camera, it's a little
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.660]   bit off camera, but way easier than mist. Yeah. Well, it's yeah, much easier than doing anything.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:10.180]   But and I love the music. But you don't even know how big the download was or anything.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.260]   They don't tell you anything. I wonder how much bandwidth this is enough for people.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:25.220]   Well, yeah, I mean, isn't that a point? Mm hmm. See how it gets you to follow it? It gets
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.780]   you to follow it around. I have to turn it to follow the action. 19 megabytes according
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:40.660]   to Boeing. It's also funny. This this this mouse wants to wear this red hat and he's
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.220]   having trouble. So you have to fight. You could lose it. I have to turn it to find it.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:53.740]   How can I? Is there any way I can eat three cameras? I know. How can I? I can't show you.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.100]   And by the way, if I stay over here, nothing will happen. I have to go over because the
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.860]   bear shows up. There's the bear. You can kind of see it. Right. And then there's a squirrel
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.980]   I think. Yeah, there's a bunch of different characters. He flies through the air at one
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:10.860]   point. It now there's a squirrel not the bear. It's the squirrel. Right. I just love it.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:17.100]   So Jason just gives me a link to someone who recorded it using Google Glass. Wow. Oh,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.140]   okay. Well, there you go. So you can you can follow it around. Of course we get an ad.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:30.100]   Well, I like that. It says don't go to the gym. So I I, yes, you win. You know, so that's
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.060]   good with glass. So how would he do? Oh, I see he's turning around. Yeah. He's all
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.980]   right. Again and it's really crazy in a second. I lost it when I first did it. Yeah, I did
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.700]   too. Doesn't it mean it's is something you're going to do more than once. There's something
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.500]   you're going to do multiple. Sorry. What you're going to do is you're going to give it to
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.460]   people. He's even having trouble following it apparently. Yeah. Look down. Oh, where it
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:58.340]   gets very. Oh, there's a ton of stuff. Wow. It's about what about five or six minutes.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:07.660]   It's a short. It's fun. It's cool. And it raises all sorts of all sorts of questions.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.860]   But this is typical of Google, isn't it? That they push the envelope and then people go,
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.900]   whoa, that crossed the line or like, look, the motor on the story app player was probably
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.100]   pre-installed on your Moto X, right? Yeah. Permissions already accepted and I was just
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.940]   push the story down. Yeah. So maybe this isn't an issue. This isn't a privacy issue. It doesn't
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.660]   say I was concerned that they were bypassing androids, you know, app installation security
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.660]   thing where they prompt you. Is this okay? But maybe they're not doing that at all. Maybe
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.380]   they're just pre-installed on your Moto X. I guess that's what it was. Although it's
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.740]   an invisible icon. You don't see is an app. So you can't uninstall it. Yeah. Well, that's
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:52.100]   kind of bogus. Yeah, but we've seen that happen before. Yeah. That's cool. It's really kind
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   of cool. It does. It's a little bit like Ice Age. Yeah. All right. That's there you go.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:04.780]   That's Motorola's spotlight and only about 1% of you can even play that. That's also
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.140]   a little unusual. Because ultimately that this is a marketing tool, right? To get people
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:14.620]   to at least consider a Moto X. Yeah. Tell you, still my favorite phone ever that I've
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:20.980]   I just really I don't know what it is about. It's just appealing. I was trying one out
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:28.300]   and my oldest daughter now wants one. She wants to trade in her. She has a note. A Moto
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.180]   X. Oh, Moto X. She was trading her iPhone for Moto X. Yeah. I think it appeals to iPhone
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:41.100]   users. And so she likes like she wanted. She was thinking about the Samsung S4, but it's
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.180]   it's quite large and her hand is very small. The Moto X is a nice size. It's just the right
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.460]   size. It's just right. We've had a few guests on a on all about Android. Come on and say
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:55.860]   yeah, Moto X, my favorite. It's hard to on paper. It doesn't appeal is medium specs.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.540]   And speaking of which, where am I? Where's I'm? I can't wait. I want in, you know, me.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:06.060]   I'm on the Nexus five. But where is it? And why can't we buy it? Everything everything
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.220]   they need to know about it. We already know it's all leaked out. Or is it supposed to
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.180]   be tomorrow or Thursday? But I expected Google to schedule an event to announce it. And that
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.540]   didn't happen. Well, here's one thing I think we can pretty much be sure of. It will be in
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:24.220]   short availability. So you're going to want to order it the minute it appears on the play
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:32.460]   store. How are we going to know? You know, watch Twitter or Google plus. You could set
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:41.940]   up an if this than that. Oh, oh, okay. Let's do it right now. So we did that with Twitter
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:48.860]   is S one. So I saw a pocket rusting said that that networks you got the you got the push.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.020]   Yeah, so a little late. I should filter with the promise if I filter Twitter now on Nexus
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:25:01.580]   five. I want to see a million posts. Yeah. Yeah. So this is I F T T T dot com. If this then
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:11.500]   that the this let's see what would be the best thing to plug in RSS RSS on what Google
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.540]   play store have an RSS. Oh, oh, that would be good. And their devices. I don't think that
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:28.620]   they do though. If they had an RSS feed of devices, they hate RSS. They do Google Twitter
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:35.180]   accounts. Oh, that might be it. Yeah, maybe. All right. So let me I'll do Twitter. We'll
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:43.140]   start with Twitter. Right. And then a new tweet. New favorite tweet. New tweet by you.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:51.820]   No, these are the triggers I want new tweet by you. So how did you do it, Matthew? You
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:26:01.380]   were looking for a text in a tweet. Looking for. Yeah, S one in an RSS update at the S
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:10.820]   at the SEC's. That girl. So I don't know what what would be the unit you want an RSS feed,
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:18.060]   yeah. Well, there are a few for the for a tweet for a tweet anymore. Are there? I think you
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:25.700]   can hack one up, but I don't think they provide them. Yeah. Okay, here we go. App.net. Can't
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.420]   do it on Twitter. Apparently the API has been restricted enough now that it's not part
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.540]   of this in that. But I can say new post by anyone with a hashtag. So I'm going to do
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:41.940]   hashtag Nexus five. I need better. But the app that is so small that it probably that's
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:50.540]   not going to overwhelm me. And then I'll send myself a text. Oh boy. You're getting a lot
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.820]   of texts. I could have a phone call. Well, where should I put it? Should I put it? I'm
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.620]   just looking for the search results in Nexus five on Twitter and it's a lot of them. It
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:05.420]   says a lot of them. Yeah. Two minutes ago, three minutes. I'm sending myself a text.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:13.260]   Send me an SMS. And in that SMS, blows up. I mean, you could add Google Play Store or
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:20.460]   you could add. You know, I want to miss it. It's only for a couple of days. Here's what
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.940]   you do. Hire somebody on task rabbit to just refresh the Google Play Store over and over
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:31.340]   here from our chat room from cosmic arbiter in our chat room. It's on XDA developers.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.100]   I made a script to alert me when the Nexus five was available. It's a Python script that
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.660]   watches seven different pages and post notifications when it detects a change with the text in
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.780]   XS five and then posts a message using a Twitter account. So this is the Twitter account
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.860]   you should follow at in five stock. So you're done. The cool part about this is you can
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:57.820]   easily get push notifications in the Twitter account. So let's take a look at N five stock
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:07.380]   on Twitter and see if there's anything here. Just added based on the weeks Thursday. Yeah,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:15.580]   this is just people talking. I'm going to follow in five stock. That's for sure. I love
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.580]   hackers.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:23.740]   I wrote a Python script. That was all I needed to do. It's obvious. Why didn't you think
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.100]   of that? One of the Android police folks are saying it's going to happen tomorrow morning
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:36.140]   between eight thirty eight and ten AM probably no later than eleven AM Pacific tomorrow.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.340]   So just to recap, what do we know about this? The Nexus five, we first saw a picture on
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:46.260]   when they put Kit Kat out in the Google Plex. It's an LG Bade phone. Nice. It looks pretty
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.340]   big, maybe four point probably five inches to five and a half inches, right? It looked
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:56.980]   pretty big. We have seen a benchmark now in one of the gaming benchmarks that showed
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:04.100]   it to be the second fastest GPU after the iPhone five S course it'll run Kit Kat 1920
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:10.620]   by 1080 display on a four point nine five inch screen is what one rumor says eight megapixel
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:22.220]   camera one point three megapixel front facing. It'll be a Snapdragon 800 of course quad core.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:28.340]   Black and white 16 and 32. But and this is one of the most interesting rumors for all
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:33.460]   of that. And that would be a top of the line spec wise phone except with the exception of
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:41.620]   the camera maybe 350 bucks. And next the last Nexus was very cheap too. It makes it very
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:48.260]   desirable unlocked. That's cheap. Yeah, that's cheap. It's kind of like a G two, but for
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:57.940]   a lot less money. 445 pixels per inch says this leak anyway. That's the highest PPI I
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:04.780]   have ever seen. So that's why we're all saying, Oh, when will it be out? Because we know that
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:10.380]   you'll be able to order it for five minutes before they're out of stock. We just want
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:16.300]   to be there for that first five minutes. Yeah, yeah. I think an I have TTT recipe is
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.260]   an order. So you got to set up. You got to set up without. Yeah, I haven't got any text
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:26.460]   yet. So that's grab it. Task grab is probably the best way to do it. People are chat. Yeah,
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:34.180]   that's grab it. It's right. Mechanical Turk. Yeah. Do you think that's a legitimate price?
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:41.260]   350 for unlocked. Yeah. Oh, do I think that that price is real? It seems so low. It seems
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.900]   low. It does seem low. It seems wishful to me. Wishful. I hope I prove wrong. Yeah. What
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:53.900]   would be the most? I mean, if it were the if we're market price to be 650 bucks, right?
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:31:03.820]   Right. So it's going to be the next. I think it's fair to say the next 24 hours. But I'm
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:13.460]   going to be watching my phone like a hawk. Let's let's talk about the new data center
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:20.820]   that Google's building on the San Francisco Bay. Google Google has a patent for water-based
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:26.460]   data centers. There's a mysterious building going up near Treasure Island, which is where
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:34.100]   the Navy used to be. It's an island in the middle of the Bay. The Bay Bridge leads to
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:43.340]   it. And there's a barge with a four story stack of shipping containers out there. Nobody
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:51.420]   knows anything about it. Although they say, although now CNET and now Channel 5 News,
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.060]   K-Pix 5 has learned probably by reading CNET that Google is actually building a floating
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:08.300]   marketing center, a kind of giant Apple store, but for Google Glass. What? Channel 5, what?
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.260]   An insider close to the San Francisco Bay Conservation Development Commission says Google
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:16.940]   has spent millions on this, but they can't park this barge on the waterfront without a
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.900]   permit and they don't have one. Wait, you weren't kidding about the Google Glass thing?
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.460]   That's what Channel 5 is saying. I thought you were a gentleman.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.060]   I'm sure they have great sources. Channel 5.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:39.940]   CNET says it's a day. Everybody's talking, nobody knows. But based primarily on the fact
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.420]   that Google has already had a patent for a C-based data center. The reason being, there's
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.780]   two things you really needed at data center, unlimited power and unlimited cooling. And
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:55.860]   of course, the C provides both. We wrote back in 2008 about Google, the patents and them
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:02.620]   talking about, scientists talking about, that would be a great idea. It makes total sense.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:08.260]   There are... I get the cooling, but some question, energy from the C. How does that work?
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:17.100]   It's waves. Okay. Is it? I don't know. It's magic. It might be temperature differential.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.940]   The patent actually mentions a wave powered electrical generator system using machines
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:28.420]   from a company called Palamas. Wow. So, I guess these are just wind turbines except these
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:34.660]   waves. Okay. It's high. It's pretty genius. Do you remember when...
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:39.060]   A pre-indigenous extension cord. Remember sea lands? Do you remember when they were...
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.700]   I wanted to buy an old... I was really... Until I found out the maintenance costs were sky
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.940]   high. I was really interested in buying an old oil, disused oil well. Apparently, there's
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:56.420]   quite a few of them. You know, a C platform. And put "Twit" there.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.820]   Great. International waters. International waters. Pirate podcasting. Issue your own currency.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.380]   Yeah. Like sea land. Sea land had some currency. Passports, stamps. And Bitcoin. And that could
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.340]   be the... Someone was gonna... Someone was gonna put servers in the big tubes that make
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:18.780]   up the legs and basically submerge them. So, I think sea land had the same problem, which
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.420]   was... Is it still around? Because it was very expensive, I think. Yeah. Still around.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.100]   So, the principality of sea land. It's a bit of work. It's a fixer. It's in an oil rig
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:33.300]   in the middle of the North Sea. It's nice view though. They're cheap. Because what happens
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.700]   is you can only get, you know, the well runs dry. And they got... They built this platform
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:44.300]   out there. You can buy them cheap. Sea land was a defensive... Now, I can't remember.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   Oh, was it an oil rig? No, I don't think so. No. There were a whole bunch of them for
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   the Second World War. Oh! Yeah. Interesting. It was known as "HM Fort rogues." I am reading
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:04.420]   off of... It's a fort. Yes. It's a fort. Yeah. It's a fort. A sea fort. Huh. Hello?
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.980]   A little crazy there though. Yeah. Well, the weather's terrible. It's hard to get people
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:13.620]   out there. I just like... And there's really nobody's... There's no reason to do fire a
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.420]   radio. We're a podcast. But... Sure wouldn't be fun. Sure wouldn't be fun.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:27.820]   Ah, I might get a little cabin fever after a while. The other issue with this sea-based
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.460]   data center, according to the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.540]   is you're not allowed to build something on the bay that you could reasonably build on
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:52.220]   land. It needs to be a permit. It seems like this is... They don't have approvals. But
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.700]   they're building it. They're building something. And who gave them permits? That's the question.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:02.420]   I mean, right. Well, and you couldn't build something like this on land because you would
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:09.780]   not have wave power. Would you? Right. So maybe that's the story. Hey, we can't. We
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:15.100]   needed waves. It does make sense though. I mean, Google's got to be using up almost every
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:21.780]   place in the world. You can get sort of huge amounts of reliable power. Got to be getting
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:29.100]   close. Think about the challenge, right? And then we saw this announcement yesterday with
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.500]   Vic Undotra, the new Google+ stuff. And they're going to store your photos in full quality.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.220]   They're going to run servers to grind on your videos and make edits. And I mean, this is
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:46.900]   crazy. They're building... I mean, they're creating demand for more data centers. I mean,
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:52.260]   that's true. I mean, it's almost... It feels like they're almost profligate spending. Here's
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:37:02.780]   the Channel 5 reporter talking to somebody through the intercom. Local news is so funny.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:10.980]   Basically, they have a lot of pictures of people saying no, not closing doors, but there's
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.740]   something there. They're building something. So my other dumb question is, I get the cooling
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:22.580]   and I get the electricity, but the connectivity also has to be amazing, right? So if it's
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.820]   out to sea, if it's out in the middle of the sea far away, I mean, right now it's in the
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.980]   bay, right? But if it's out there... I don't think you're bringing out to sea. I think
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   you have to dock it. Yeah, you dock it. Yeah. Or maybe you use Google Loon. That's true,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:42.020]   but Google Loon's the connectivity rates were not... No, and the latency's a problem. And
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.700]   yeah. So you could tap into one of those. You can tap into that cord out there to the
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.260]   bay and you're good. You're good to go. You could tap into one of those undersea cables,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.780]   right? The NSA, does that? Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe you just drop it to a cable. Of
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:38:00.180]   course, that's it. You have an undersea cable. That's... Yes. Wow. Of course you do. And there's
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.940]   lots of room in the ocean. That's it. Of course. I just sent some divers down to the bottom
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.620]   there. No, as you're going, as you're sailing out, you just have a big spool and you go,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.180]   "Oh, I see you dropping cables." You're laying cable as you go out.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:24.900]   Right, right. Yep. Yep. That's a hell of an anchor. I love a company that will put animations
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.980]   on my phone and data centers in the middle of the ocean. I love that kind of... And do
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.620]   the good work of laying undersea cable for us in the process. Apparently, Brendan in
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.220]   our chair, says they're building another one in Portland, Maine. Something similar. That's
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:46.100]   right. This is scary. This is really Skynet. Scared. That's kind of awesome. So I'm way
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.740]   cooler with this than the flying hat. Really? See, I have a mix... I have a mixture of fear
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.580]   of both. You know, they could submerge those and then use some of the access heat to heat
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:02.740]   up like a hotel and sell rooms in some underwater, server farm hotel. Stay in the underwater
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:10.020]   Google hotel. Presumably somebody's working on that already.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:16.500]   This is what happens when a company is too damn successful. Gosh darn it. All right,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.340]   we're going to take a break. When we come back to change log, yes, there have been a
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.700]   lot of changes to Google plus really cool changes. Gene of Trepene will have those for
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.940]   you and a whole lot more. Matthew Ingram's here from Gigahome. We're talking about Google

[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:12.680]   Now ladies and gentlemen, break out the fluegal horns. It's time for the Google change log.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:25.180]   Now, Gina Trippani will tell us what's new with the Goog. Lots of Google+ improvements
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:30.900]   this week. Google held a press event a couple of days ago and unveiled a bunch of new features.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:37.380]   Google+ is getting lots of new features for photos and videos. First, iOS users are getting
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.420]   full-size backups for the first time. That's worked for Android for quite some time. You
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.500]   got better auto-enhanced that you can adjust up and down to your liking. A new filter called
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.300]   HDRscape. Vic and Dautre explain that normal camera can't properly display the colors that
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.460]   a human eye can see, but an HDR photograph, which used to involve a lot of complex expensive
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:05.660]   software. Well, that's all bundled into Google+ right now. Google also enhanced their search
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.260]   capabilities. So I think we show this a few episodes ago. You can go into your Google+
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:16.020]   photos and say, "Show me photos of food," or "Show me photos of trees." Google+ has already
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.820]   looked at your photos, figured out what objects are shown there, and will show them to you
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.900]   in search results. They've improved that and they've increased the number of objects
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:29.780]   that Google Search can recognize inside your photos to over 1,000. Google can detect lab
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:37.620]   radores and snowmen, tulips, umbrellas, laptops, shoes. This is kind of magic, folks.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.380]   It really works well, although I asked for dogs and I got some ducks. I searched for puppies
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.340]   and it showed me one of the pictures of my daughter, who is as cute as a puppy, but not
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:53.860]   quite a puppy. Except for the two ducks, I think they nailed it. You can even search
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:59.140]   for people's names. Yep, you search for people's names and you can search from your photo
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.740]   library and from people in your-- from your circles photos libraries, photos that are available
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.580]   to you. So you'll see Leo there. You can see the link from your circles is right next
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.860]   to from your photo library, which is also new. This is totally cool. I mean, I forgot
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:20.300]   I had this video. This is Henry, my son, reading for the very first time in 2000-- Okay, my
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:27.900]   guess was really easy. Aw. Good dad. He's now freshman in college. Don't do it. Make
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:45.820]   sure you're good. This is the most precious video I have. And I found it. Wow. I mean,
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:51.460]   that's pretty amazing to have that. Thank you, Google. You're going to make me cry now.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.900]   Is that wind in the willows? It's a frog and toad and if you had little kids, you would
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:02.700]   know it. You will know it, Gina. That's the first time he ever read to me. Oh, he has
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   a Hogwarts shirt on. This is killing me. This isn't if I can't. This is killing me. I didn't
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.140]   even remember that I uploaded it. But I guess it's going through Picasso Web or something
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:28.260]   like that. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That is pretty cool to be able to search for a name and get
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.460]   that. It's pretty amazing. And I'm really glad that iOS users are getting this as well.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.380]   I feel like the auto upload and all of Google Plus's photo features, people kind of talk
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.180]   down Google Plus all the time. But really, the photo stuff and hangouts to me are the killer,
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:49.160]   the killer features. I am. This is amazing. Yeah. For sure, the photo stuff is--
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:55.500]   It loves me away. And speaking of the photo stuff, there's three new auto awesome features.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.800]   One is called action and it's for action photos. So if you take a series of photos with someone
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:04.500]   moving like dancing or running or jumping, auto awesome can merge them together into
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.180]   one action shot where you can see kind of the full range of movements. So you see on the
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:13.940]   screen there a guy like skateboarding up the side of a wall, it'll merge them all together
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.340]   and show you kind of-- You know, it's interesting. Interesting about this is this is the kind
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.680]   of thing that Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One do. Yes. And now Google is doing it for
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.440]   everything. Yeah. There's a new one called eraser. So if you're at, say, a busy landmark
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.800]   where there's lots of people in the background, take a bunch of photos and succession and then
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:38.400]   Google Plus will basically remove everybody from the background and make it look like you're
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:45.000]   standing in kind of an empty space like the one up. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And then auto
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.180]   awesome movie is a little bit like HTC Zoe but more advanced. So you basically, you use
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.060]   the Google Photos app for Android, which we're going to see on-- So this is the rough cut.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.480]   These are all the videos that they took as they're doing a little road trip. Right. This
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.060]   is a bunch of videos. You take a bunch of pictures and videos and then you choose the
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.240]   ones you want to include in your auto awesome movie. Oh, so it doesn't do this automatically.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.120]   Right. This is the only one that doesn't do it doesn't do automatically. But you choose
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:19.280]   the ones you want to show and then Google stitches them together, add some music and
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.840]   you've got just a really cool, you know, stitch together movie with both stills and videos.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.440]   So you'll see in this example. This is straight out of the HTC One highlights, but better.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:35.240]   Yep. Mm hmm. Yep. So good. And it adds the music? It adds music. It adds the music.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   Yeah. Wow. And you can, you can, I think that you can, you can change the theme, the
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.200]   style, the background music. You can remove and shorten or reorder scenes as well. So there
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.320]   are some editing capabilities. So you see there's an example of a still, a few stills
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.120]   getting added. So we're really kind of getting the HTC Zoey, you know, features, but even
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:00.280]   even better. And you get to choose so that something awkward doesn't show up in your
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.480]   video. Right. Exactly. And so yeah, you choose the initial photos and videos that it includes
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.800]   and then you can even reorder scenes or edit scenes, which is, which looks really, really
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.760]   neat. I can't wait to get this. This is going to, I'm going to take so much more video just
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.520]   for this because I don't have a video. But if it's going to do this for me, then I'll
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.880]   take video for sure. I have to say the auto awesome. I was sort of skeptical about it
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.080]   because I, you know, I just wasn't sure that I wanted animated gifts in your timeline.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.560]   Yeah, to do things like that. But I took a whole bunch of photos at the lake of geese
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.840]   or something or ducks or whatever. And then all of a sudden there was this auto awesome
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:42.080]   sequence. And it's awesome. I really liked it. It's awesome. Let's have to choose it or
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.520]   get them to do it or, you know, it just happened. Yeah, and it does, it does a great job at
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.240]   highlights. Like I take a bunch of, you know, I always take five or six pictures of my kid
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.640]   and only one of them is in blurry or she's actually looking at it. And it does a great
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.320]   job of picking out the good, the one good photo that you got. It does a great job at
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:04.120]   making collages. It's yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing. I have to say this is a good
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.180]   photo. It's like a lot of it is just the time. You take like, you go on a trip, you take
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:15.120]   like 350, 600 photos. You don't have time to go through them all. And like you said, find
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.920]   the one that's good or put together a movie or I mean, the more of that they can kind
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.860]   of, they can take the pain out of that for you the easier, the, you know, more people
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.700]   are going to do it as well. And also it's such a natural because now it's in Google Plus.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.900]   So it's so easy. The easiest way to share it is all just shared on Google Plus. So it's
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:36.980]   very good for Google Plus. It, you know, it sells Android for sure, although you can
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.580]   do it on iOS too, anything that'll upload.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.260]   I have to say their photo editing tools are pretty good too in Google Plus. They bought
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.520]   right. Can't remember what it was now.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.780]   Snapseed. And that's another thing that's been approved. And the new Snapseed, I, a lot
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.900]   of us got new Google Apps today, by the way. And one of the new Google Apps was this new
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.100]   Snapseed with HDR that they had talked about.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.820]   All right. The HDR escape is one of the snacks.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:09.260]   Really good. It's like, I don't need light room anymore. Good. It's kind of. Wow. Although
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.260]   I'm not a fan of HDR, but you really can't easily.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:17.300]   It's over done. It's over done. So here's an auto awesome because I took, so the key
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.980]   with auto awesome is you've got to take a number of pictures. It's rapid sequence.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.620]   So I got Lisa going off on her jet ski. And that's not something you're going to put in
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.220]   your photo album, but you might very well share it on Google Plus, right? And it looks
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:34.980]   good. And then I have, if I go up here, I used, oh, see, it's not, I guess it's on my
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.060]   phone, but it's not yet been uploaded.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.820]   So I played with the Snapseed on these, on this image, turning on the HDR and actually
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.980]   really, really improved the image. It's kind of.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.540]   That kind of auto fix thing, again, like to saving people time, like so you don't have
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.740]   to open another app and then fiddle with it and then save it and then export it. And I
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.900]   mean, all of that just sort of making it sharper or fixing up the white balance. I mean, that
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.460]   stuff makes a huge difference.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.180]   It's great. A lot of those Snapseed capabilities are actually already in Google Plus and the
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:11.400]   browser, by the way, you know, the drama shot is so cool. I just, there's so much good
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.580]   stuff in here, you know,
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.060]   Oh, neat. Yeah. Very cool.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:22.140]   And then you control the strength too. This is just on the web and the saturation. I mean,
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:29.700]   it's just, you can really change something. So, yeah, wow, Bravo.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:35.500]   Yeah, good stuff for photos and videos. Hangouts also is getting an update, which hasn't gotten
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.860]   pushed down yet, but it's on its way. Google is adding location sharing to hang out. So
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.340]   if someone hangs out to you or chats you, it says, Hey, where are you? You can just tap
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.540]   on a button and you can send someone Google map of your current locations. They can find
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.620]   you, which is, which is kind of neat. Something that a lot of group chats have had for a
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.620]   while, but I think still useful. Have you gotten the SMS capability yet?
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:03.220]   No, not yet. This hasn't rolled out yet. So SMS integration and support. And I'm honestly
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.420]   not sure how this is going to work. I don't know if you have to register your native phone
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.420]   number. I use Google Voice. So I'm not even sure how the voice integration is going to
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:15.300]   work. This hasn't been pushed out yet. The registration has though. So, it's not going
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.500]   to work. If you use Hangouts, you can add phone numbers and I've added all my regular phone
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:23.260]   numbers to it. Okay. Okay. So yes, I use Google Voice. So there has the Google Voice
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:28.860]   number, but if you go into settings on Hangouts right now, you can see confirmed phone numbers
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.420]   and I'm not going to show these, but I have quite a few of them. And it will offer them
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:37.820]   to confirm your exist. If you tap it, it'll say, Oh, let's confirm this phone number.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:42.420]   And you'll add it. And then it says, so it sends an SMS to that phone and then it adds
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:48.140]   it. So the question is going to be, can I remove the messaging app from my doc and just put
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.820]   Hangouts there? I think I can. Right? Or I will be not yet, but I will be. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.020]   Yeah. You're right. I do actually, I do have my phone number. Yeah. You're all in there.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:03.260]   And you can add. Yeah. So it's intercepting your SMS or it's just I see it's just detecting
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.980]   that your messaging app has received an SMS and just displaying it with an Hangouts. That
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.380]   happens now with voice. So if you use Google Voice as I do, it will show up in both messaging
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:17.540]   and voice. Right. And voice. So I would presume now all three will show up. It'll show up in
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:22.060]   Hangouts, messaging and voice. And I can use any one of them as my default messaging app.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:28.540]   Right. That makes sense. That makes sense. And animated GIF support, which I know we
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:35.340]   were all waiting inside of Hangouts, of course. And then the final final update is Google
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:41.580]   Plus is expanding its custom URL availability to everyone. So custom URL is you know, you
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:47.540]   get plus Google dot com slash and then plus whatever your name is or whatever you choose.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.460]   So I've had plus Gina, Japan, for a while. Yeah. It was rolling this out to everyone.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:57.340]   Yeah. All profile profiles that have a picture at least 10 followers or in circulars, I guess.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.140]   And I've been around for at least 30 days. We'll soon be able to create a custom URL.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.820]   If you hear your profile meets the criteria, you'll see an option to on your page to start
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.540]   the process of claiming that URL or you might get an email the way that Chad did. Chad, you
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.940]   got this email, didn't you? I did. And if I go check on my thing, you can see at the top
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:23.460]   of my profile, it says I can choose to change it to plus Chad Johnson, OMG Chad. I didn't
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.780]   really want to say that's what they said. That's what they but now if I get rid of just
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:33.860]   the Chad Johnson to only choose OMG Chad, it won't let me. It says it's not allowed, which
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:40.100]   is kind of a bummer. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Oh, and that's why it's suggested
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.660]   just because you're because that's how I have a set of Johnson in parentheses, OMG Chad.
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:49.540]   And so I can't choose Chad Johnson or just OMG Chad at the moment. You can't choose Chad
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:54.980]   Johnson either. No, because Chad Johnson is a football player, which I bet. Now, I wondered
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:01.220]   if perhaps because I have a page that that is what is throwing me off is that I have
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:08.580]   a I also have a Google plus page with OMG Chad and maybe because there's a page that I can't
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.660]   I can't have it. I tried going to the page and changing my name, then I realized that that was
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:19.940]   tied to YouTube. So I'm kind of stuck right now. I don't know what to do. Maybe I should just go
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:28.500]   ahead and grab Chad Johnson. Hey, google.com/plustwitworks. Nice. So that's a page. I didn't know I don't
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.140]   know if we applied for that or not. I'm not sure either. That's good though. I'm the manager of
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:41.780]   the page and I didn't apply for it. So celebrities like us have had this for some time. Now you
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:49.140]   little people can get it too. You said that. I did not say it is. We talked about this when
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:56.260]   they started doing it for verified names that it's not it's not a fish. It's not part of the web
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:05.060]   RFCs that you put a plus in a URL. Is it not really? Yeah, no, plus when you URL encode
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:13.540]   a data plus generally indicates a space. So it's a little weird to have the process. It works.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:21.060]   Yeah. Well, Google. But yeah, I mean, my plus is work, right? But like, but it's usually used
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.780]   to encode encode spaces. Oh, I guess that's right. Because it's it's it's it's Google's. Oh, no,
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:31.380]   it's a URL. It's not a Google search. So URL, right? Or is it? Oh, maybe Google parses it.
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:38.500]   Maybe it Oh, that's probably what it is. It comes in as Google.com with some entity attached
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:49.220]   and Google parses it and sends back a website. Right? I don't know. Yes. Yes. Work for me. Yes.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.500]   Their server. They made it work. Yeah. They can do whatever they want. Imagine the marketing guys.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.820]   Plus the plus much work. We don't care about the RFC plus most work. Hey, can you do this?
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:08.900]   And it's somebody some some geek in Google. Oh, yeah, I can do that. Like we can do it. But
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:17.060]   technically the RFC is violation. But man, why not? Let's do it. Let's do it.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:23.460]   Hey, how'd you get a dancing cat in your in your header picture? You just upload a gift.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:30.020]   It's a gift. Yeah. Or a chip or a chip ending on not a movie. It's a it's a GIF or a gift. Yeah,
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:36.660]   I did not take a son of a movie a movie picture and then that auto awesome. No, is anybody chat
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:42.420]   room anybody in the chat? I've got a yet done this moving picture thing. They showed a really
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:47.220]   good one. Vic showed a really good one of one of his co workers running on the bridge.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:53.140]   And he said, you know, we don't know exactly what you prefer. Maybe that woman running through
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:58.580]   the shot of the bridge is destroying it. Maybe that's your girlfriend and you care about her.
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:05.460]   So we do both. We we make a us what do they call this new running shot where this shows her going
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:09.860]   boom, cinema gram or something like that or well, it's tech. I mean, it was cinema gram that
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.980]   it started doing this on iOS that was an asset. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.540]   But I don't know what the name of it is. Auto awesome action. I think there's an
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:20.340]   auto awesome action. So it goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And then they also take her out of
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.100]   it completely and say, you know, by the way, here's the bridge. If that's what you would look at.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:30.500]   Okay, we're going to here's a here's one from turnip head. He says, here's a great one.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:35.380]   I'd like to see it. This is a feature that Samsung has in its galaxy. They call it golf shot,
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.100]   but I've never been able to get it to work on the galaxy very well. Oh, no, this is an auto
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:45.380]   awesome, but I do like this. But I was I wanted the one where it was somebody running or
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:52.420]   John drops. Yeah, that's pretty neat. Isn't that nice? The raindrops. That's a whole
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.900]   that's a whole category of animated gifts or chips or whatever you want to call it.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.780]   That's a cinema gram. Yeah, like that. So you just get a that's a cinema graph, but there's
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.460]   one thing moving like that's what we call a cinemagraph. But I was thinking of the ones like
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.900]   with a golf swing where you get the golf club in all of its positions. The other thing they showed
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:16.100]   is if you overlap, let's say you're it's a basketball shot and you're moving too fast
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:20.500]   to overlap, they ghost the overlapped images and save the last one. I mean, it's exactly what you
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:27.540]   would want. Yeah, I got to say the one where you can erase people. That's the one I'm probably
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:33.220]   the most interested in just because you do take photos lots of times of, you know, places and
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.820]   there's a giant crowd and you can't see the thing you're trying to take a picture of.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:43.380]   Yeah, or you get photo bombed. You're racist. Yeah. Yeah. I really have to, you know,
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:48.340]   play with these. I keep meaning to go out and take. But I think the best thing is when it just
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:52.660]   happens by serendipitously and you go back to your Google+ photos, you're going to go, oh,
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:58.580]   yeah, look what happened. It is really delightful. Like, I first I was a little annoyed
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.580]   so I can email from Google like, you've got 24 new photos ready for sharing. I'd be like, yeah,
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.420]   yeah. But then you click through them and you see the highlights. Like, oh, yeah, this is great.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.100]   Like it's definitely a delightful experience because they're showing you the best photos.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.460]   They've made you collage. They've done, you know, the auto awesome stuff. You're like, whoa,
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:18.100]   these look even better than when I took them. Yeah, I think it really does market the service
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.540]   really well because you're not expecting it. And then it's like someone took your photos and
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:26.740]   went away with them and fiddle with them and then shows you what they did and it's pretty cool.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:34.180]   Look what I did for you. I'm your creepy stalker. Because you raised all those nasty people from
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:39.060]   your I'm your creepy girlfriend. Look, I created the best version of your life for you. I arranged
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:45.380]   your closet. I ended out all the crappy photos in real life. You have five photos. Here's the
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:52.900]   highlight reel from your day. But Gina, you nailed it. You want to take more photos and videos now
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.500]   with your phone all of a sudden. It's like, yeah, and I'm so much more willing to just snap, snap,
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   snap, snap, snap. And and I know that, you know, I'm not gonna have to sort through them myself
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.340]   to find the best one. Google, I'm gonna have an email from Google saying, Hey, look,
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.460]   and there's gonna be a great shot of my kid, which is really nice.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:14.500]   That's all I got for the change. Here's one from Paul Moody. This is kind of an
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:21.060]   eight one of a cliff diver. So yeah, see the ghost. Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:27.300]   So how do you do that? You do a rapid shot, I guess so. You go
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:35.700]   and Google something like fast burst camera or the fast burst mode, which I which I believe is
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:40.340]   actually might be available. There might be a fast burst mode in the latest stock camera
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:46.500]   update on Android. Oh, really? Well, it would make sense. Yeah, yeah, it would make sense.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.500]   Wow, this is really neat. And that's the Google change log.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:01:01.700]   I can't wait till my photo streams filled with all of these. It's gonna be interesting.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:07.540]   Moving, let's see, let's take a break and then come back. We'll talk more about the Google
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:15.460]   and some other things that Vic mentioned. Some really interesting things that might be
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:21.460]   used for those of you who are Google plus fanatics to respond to those Twitter naysayers.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:27.380]   Our show today brought to you by our friends is Shutterstock. If you're looking for stock images,
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:32.260]   a great place to go. Because how long before somebody like Shutterstock doesn't deal with Google and
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:37.220]   you could mark or maybe Flickr, you could mark pictures saying, "No, this should go to Shutterstock."
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:45.300]   They have a lot of pictures. They added 200,000 new images this week, 30 million images
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.780]   at Shutterstock.com. Since there's always new images, there's always good reason to go back and look
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.740]   around and maybe pick an image for your blog or your presentation for your advertisement,
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:02:00.180]   your publication. It's royalty free. That's nice. The search engine is super cool. I can search for
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.700]   cliff diver, but I can also search for cliff diver illustration, click the cliff diver vector.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:11.460]   I can search for happy cliff diver and sad cliff diver, blue cliff diver and green cliff diver.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.860]   They've got a great little color spectrum tool that lets you actually pick palettes.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:21.540]   Great for designers. The light boxes are really neat too. Now you have to make a free account with
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:26.420]   Shutterstock.com for the light boxes. But once you do, you can take any image and put it in the light
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.020]   box. You don't need to give them a credit card to do that by the way or you just set up in a
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.580]   cap free account. They also don't forget to click the footage tab because they've got great video
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:42.740]   footage, really high quality video footage. 1.3 million of them. Shutterstock.com.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.900]   Now if you do decide to buy, you can buy image packs. You can buy subscriptions. That's what we have.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:51.540]   It's the most affordable way to do it. I think we get 25 images a day for a flat rate. It's a very
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:03:00.020]   good deal. If you do do that, please use our offer code and you'll get 25% off your new account
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:10.660]   at Twig 1013 is the offer code. Twig 1013, twig 1013 at Shutterstock.com. Beautiful site. I use it
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:18.020]   for inspiration. I'll search for things and I get ideas, really kind of a creative whack-up
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:28.740]   decided ahead. Shutterstock.com. So during the talk a couple of days ago, was it yesterday? It was
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:41.540]   yesterday. Vic mentioned that Google+ has 300 million active users every month. Take that Twitter.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:49.300]   Take that Leo. How are they counting active users? That's the immediate reaction. Is that
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:54.980]   can't be right? What does active mean? Yeah, I mean, what is plus? Like what are users mean?
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.380]   Because this is the thing about Google+. Everybody says, I don't use Google+,
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.180]   actually know you do. Because if you use Hangouts, if you sign into Google, if you use profiles,
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.740]   if you use YouTube, if you use docs, I mean, like Google+ has just baked into everything
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:12.260]   in some little way, right? It doesn't necessarily mean you're posting on plus.google.com.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.380]   Okay. Be like that. You're saying, okay, I'm gonna count plus one button, clicks and all of that.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:24.420]   Then you have 540 million active users. So active users, Google says anybody who interacts with
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:30.340]   Google+ in some way on any Google property that could be leaving a comment on a blog or website
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:35.860]   with Google+ comments enabled, as our site does, commenting on YouTube, that counts,
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:41.620]   clicking the plus one button. That gets you half 540 million. The 300 million is active in-stream
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:50.420]   viewers, people who actually go to the Google+ content stream. 300 million. Once 300 million a month.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.300]   Who are these people? Who are these people? Because, I mean, you know,
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:03.220]   me and you and Chad, and I'm sure that's only it's once every four weeks, right? You have to go once.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:08.340]   Right. Because none of my friends and family who don't work in tech do this.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:14.820]   I know. I mean, either. I know. I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying to talk bad about Google+,
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.740]   so I, you know, I actually, I hate when people are saying that Google+ is a total failure,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.220]   because I don't think that it is, but none of my friends and family are actually writing anything
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.460]   on Google+, either. Most of them just have a profile set up and they might.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:31.780]   You kind of have to. Because you kind of have to, right? To use Google to be signed into Google.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:36.100]   At this point, Google prompts you so often just create a profile and that's profiles is Google+.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:42.500]   Now, I mean, everything's so integrated. But viewing the content stream, like going to plus.google.com.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.980]   That's a right. To me, that was always the genius was to integrate it into everything.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:52.660]   Right. Everything Google has in. So you, you link to it even without even realizing it because
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:57.300]   your account is connected to something else. I mean, that seemed to me really smart. But I,
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:03.700]   yeah, I would agree. I can't see that many people deliberately go to go plus.google.com and look
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.380]   at something or do something. I, you know, I use it every day. I use it all the time.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.820]   And the more they do things like these new photo enhancements, the more likely I am to use it.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.260]   I mean, they've made it really great, really useful. And I don't even do it.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:19.460]   I do it. I check it because the number comes up, you know, when you're in Gmail or whatever,
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:25.140]   the little bar, the number comes up. And so I have sort of notification anxiety. And so I click on it,
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:30.980]   you know, to be what it is. You wouldn't want to be me. Numbers on all as always.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:35.700]   So somebody in the chat room, this is an interesting completely anecdotal data point.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.620]   Says my 14 year old and all his friends use Google+ instead of Facebook now.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:44.180]   What? That surprises me. But I think that I think kids don't like Facebook.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.620]   Facebook has become their parents place. Twitter, even more so.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.100]   Actually, I would disagree with that. No. My, my daughter and lots of her friends,
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.580]   it's Tumblr and Twitter. Right. And sometimes Instagram.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:03.060]   Tumblr, I'll grant you Instagram, Instagram, Vine and Tumblr. Very big with young folk.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:07.540]   But it was interesting because creative types. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.980]   Twitter and Tumblr are both for live blogging shows that they like, like, or live tweeting.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:16.020]   So you're watching a financial. So they like, they're teenagers, right?
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:21.940]   Yeah. They like Twitter. Yeah. And interestingly enough, both of my daughters,
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:29.300]   youngest ones, six, almost 16 and the middle one is 20. They both love, you know,
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.860]   Doctor Who and supernatural shows like that. They live.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.260]   Yikes. Live tweet them. They live blog them. But they also, they've both created fake
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.820]   Twitter accounts, pretending to be characters in those shows.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.580]   Right. Interesting.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.940]   Oh, yeah. So for fan fiction type thing, first of all, you raised your daughter's right.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.860]   Matthew, that's a long one. Yes, he did. Did he know?
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:53.940]   Yeah. He did. But yeah, for fan fiction, I mean, you know, it is really cool to see,
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:59.380]   you know, characters and TV shows. I totally follow like the Mad Men characters on Twitter.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:05.300]   And even some of the newsroom tweets I follow because you actually get some sort of news, news
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:10.980]   items from, uh, but yeah, that's, that's interesting. So did you see, what do you think
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.700]   about Arrington's opinion piece, uh, uncrunched about how Google should buy
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:21.060]   Twitter before the IPO? You know, I almost, I almost wrote something about it because it,
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.340]   it, it makes a huge amount of sense. It certainly makes a lot of sense for Google.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.300]   I'm not sure it makes as much sense for Twitter, especially since they're just about to go public.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.620]   Like if Google was going to buy them, it would have made a lot more sense to try and do it
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:40.260]   six months ago, you know, to say, um, let's, let's kind of, you know, forget about the IPO and we'll
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:45.460]   offer you way more than you're going to get. And, but now it's so close. It's hard to imagine that
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.740]   Twitter would actually say, okay, like it'd have to be a huge number.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:54.180]   I'm sure that Google has made offer. I mean, I'm sure that Twitter has had to turn down offers,
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.780]   right? But, but his point is that the IPO is coming up and so they could just buy, buy them
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:02.500]   right out. Um, the thing about this piece that I didn't like is that, you know, Arrington was like,
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.820]   do Google plus supposedly the number two social network after Facebook, but I don't buy it. No,
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.140]   and I know he uses Google plus much. Um, and I don't see people giving out the Google plus names on
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:17.780]   cable news networks and other TV shows. Uh, that's true, but that's not the only measure of the
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.780]   success of a social network. So, so, so we were just talking about, you know, the Google plus's
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:27.060]   use numbers are a lot higher than we thought. And because it's integrated across all Google products,
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.260]   there is high usage there. And actually you could argue that Twitter and Google plus might make a
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:39.380]   good combination in a way. I mean, Twitter is used by still a relatively small number of people and
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:44.340]   and relatively sort of, you know, people who are looking for a specific thing. Maybe it's a news
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.860]   service. Maybe it's just sort of short sharing or whatever, whereas Google plus with particularly
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:54.580]   with the photo stuff and all the, it's much more of a community. So you could see those two things
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:10:00.340]   fitting well together. Um, even complimentary, I still don't see it happening though, to be honest.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.660]   Yeah, I think it makes perfect sense. Mike points out, and I think he's right here that
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:12.100]   the search signals you get from Twitter alone are worth billions. Twitter is valued at 11 billion.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.100]   Would agree. Yeah. I would agree. So you'd have to offer more than 11 billion for the board to
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.620]   even consider it since they're about to go public at a $17 to $20, which give them
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.500]   they'd have to be 15 to 20. Yeah. Mike says that have to be significantly more. It's going to be a
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:30.340]   big chunk. Google can afford that. But he's right about the search. It's worth something. It's worth
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:35.940]   a lot. I'm trying to remember who who wrote it. Kevin Marks pointed to a blog post that was talking
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:45.300]   about Twitter's short URL shortener, the T dot CO. Right. So every link that goes through Twitter
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:51.780]   gets shortened by T dot CO or wrapped by T dot COs. And they forbid Google from crawling any of
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.820]   those links following them. So they are the only ones who have access to all of the links that
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:01.300]   are shared on Twitter. That's a huge. I mean, that'd be worth billions right there. Exactly.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:07.940]   And I think frankly, Google, Twitter is more valuable to Google than it is by itself. I'm sure of it.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:13.700]   So the problem though, I'm sure there are people like Vic inside of Google,
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.700]   we're saying, no, give Google plus a chance. Look, we're getting traction. That's why Vic brings
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:24.100]   up those numbers. Yeah. We're getting a little bit missing for me. Google plus is connected to
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   everything Google, but it is not connected to anything non-Google, at least, at least not in
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:35.780]   in any useful way. So if somebody dies, Hollywood celebrity dies, you don't go to Google plus to
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.180]   find out if you heard it, if it's true, you go to Twitter, it's, it's not just that. It's the,
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:46.420]   it's the API. It's the sort of ability to read and write or to share things across platforms or
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:50.820]   cross services. You just can't do anything like that with Google plus. Well, they could fix that
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:56.740]   with an API, right? It could. But so why haven't they? That's, so it's big enough now. At first Vic
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.460]   said, we don't want to think it too noisy and we don't want it to be to whatever. But I mean,
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:06.580]   it's at this point, it's like a silo in a way. Well, and that's why Twitter is a good thing to buy
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:12.900]   because it's complimentary, 100% complimentary to Google plus. So 20 billion, there you go. Done.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:19.620]   But I think there's internal debate. I would not be at all surprised. I mean, look, the, the
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.420]   Twitter IPO is in the next couple of weeks. I would not be at all surprised to have a big
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.100]   announcement the next couple of days. Yeah, we, we're, we, and if they make an offer that's
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:33.060]   significantly over what the valuation is, the board probably can't even say no. It's like,
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:38.020]   well, you're going to the stock market. Well, the board can't say no, but you know, there have
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:44.340]   been these cases before. And I mean, for sure, venture investors are going to want. They'll be
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.780]   paused. And if it's not, if they're not getting a multiple that's that they see as enough, then
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:57.140]   they're, you know, the board is just not going to say yes. Right. Yeah. So it has to be enough.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.580]   Yeah. It's not going to be cheap. That's what Mike's around, round up to like 30, you know,
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.780]   yeah, throw an extra 10 billion in there. You keep adding more.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:14.820]   Well, Dick's going to want a couple of million. Yeah. Yeah. I, this makes a lot of sense.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:19.940]   And, and Google is shown as it showed this with YouTube, it's shown that it can buy a company
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:25.460]   like this and preserve its corporate culture, keep it somewhat separate, autonomous. They,
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:30.820]   they know how to do that. And actually, YouTube is a good example because YouTube was, you know,
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:37.380]   it was still relatively new and kind of untested when they, when they bought it. It was obvious
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:42.900]   that it was something. It was obvious. But, but they have, it has grown substantially. And,
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.460]   you know, they have managed to, to preserve it in a lot of earth to keep it from getting
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:52.020]   screwed up like lots of companies do. That's, that's, you know, the YouTube Google video
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:56.900]   comparison that Arrington makes is, it is decent. But the difference with Google pluses that Google
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.700]   plus is the core is really core. All Google products at this point. Yeah. It's not good.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.580]   Yeah. It's much more important. They're not going to get rid of it. It's much more important than
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:10.420]   Google video. Right. Like, and, and, and they're not going to buy Twitter. And then what? And they're
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:14.580]   not going to replace Google plus with a Google plus is the core of like user identity on Google.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:20.420]   I just don't know where, where Twitter wouldn't fit. Didn't they buy? Um, oh, what was that short
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:27.300]   messaging service is very similar to Twitter? Um, not pound, not jayku, jayku, thank you, jayku,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:33.140]   right? So they'd be buying the data. They'd be buying the data. But what would they, you know,
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.820]   I don't know. They don't touch it. They keep running it. They let, they let it affect.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:41.380]   I would like all they want is to continue to run it. All they want is to just open up to you.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.820]   That's he oh alone. Right. And, but I think that the, but the real fear is we don't want to kill
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:51.060]   Google plus and we think there's a lot of power and value in Google plus. And if we bought Twitter,
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.660]   that might be harmful to Google plus. I don't think it is, but it might be harmful to Google plus.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:59.140]   I think they're two different audiences and I use both and with it with it. Very, very different
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.780]   thing. Yeah, they're different. And I suppose Instagram and Facebook have been working sort of
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:11.540]   gather, but separately, you know, right? Right. Vix said that after the IPO and, you know,
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.020]   Twitter's public and whatnot, I wonder whether they wouldn't be open to some kind of licensing
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:20.260]   deal with Google, like the one they used to have where, and then they cut them off,
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:26.180]   from getting that data from Twitter. I wonder if they'd be open to some kind of deal where
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:31.140]   Google would just pay them for that data. Well, I'm sure they close it off for a reason,
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.660]   probably because they were wanted to see, well, it's valuable Google.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.140]   How valuable, right?
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:48.340]   Let's see. I'm just looking through what else is going on Google Glass 2. This is interesting.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:53.140]   You probably got this, Gina. Glass explorers have gotten, what is it, three or four invitations?
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.620]   Yes. You can now they're expanding the universe for glasses.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:07.700]   Yeah. Glass holes. So Jason, so I bought, so I bought them for Jason Howell. And he said,
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:12.100]   do you want, okay, guy, do you want, do you want glass? No, I'm not going to spend $1,500 on that.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:17.540]   I'm sorry. Yeah, that's a thing. Right. So you can invite three people to spend,
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.940]   presumably spend $1,500 on a cloud. It's not completely clear. Jason says, it doesn't say
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:26.580]   anywhere that it's going to cost money. But of course, it's going to cost $1,500.
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:32.180]   Yeah, it is. It is. And explorers also get to trade in their current hardware for the next
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.060]   iteration of the hardware, which is which is kind of nice. Are you going to do that, Jason?
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:39.060]   He doesn't hold on to this. Do you have to pay money?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:46.580]   So you want to hold on to it shrink wrapped in the box so you can sell it 20 years from now.
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:54.660]   Get the glass to. Are you going to buy the glass to Gina? Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:17:01.540]   It's compatible with prescription glasses. Hmm. Does that mean you buy lenses for your glass?
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:07.780]   Not clear. Not clear. Yeah, it's not clear. It sounds like maybe it comes with you can order,
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:13.940]   like regular glasses and have the class installed on the phone. Because there are plenty of Googlers,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.420]   I've seen them with who wear prescription glasses and glass. Well, they were working with Warby Parker,
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.180]   I'm pretty sure. Right. Oh, that's what they'll do. They'll offer a Warby Parker edition.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:27.140]   That makes sense. Send it back. Send you a milk. Yeah, exactly. And how much that can I cost?
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:33.620]   And the first driving ticket issued for driving with glass, a California woman,
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:39.220]   she was to be completely fair. She was speeding, got pulled over.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:49.620]   And then in addition, the trooper added Google Glass as part of the site.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:55.220]   I don't want San Diego. Yeah, you're down your way. I thought it might be you at first.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:18:05.220]   Driving with monitor visible to driver is the violation. And then in parentheses, he wrote Google
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:11.780]   Glass. She was also 10 miles above the speed limit. That's not normally enough to get fired over.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:17.060]   Big ups to SDPD for knowing what Google Glass was. Yeah, no kidding.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:26.740]   That's that's pretty mainstream. This is a California vehicle code section 27602.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:31.620]   A person shall not drive a motor vehicle if a television receiver, a video monitor,
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.100]   or a television or video screen or other other similar means of visually displaying
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:41.380]   a television broadcaster video signal that produces entertainment or business applications
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:47.300]   is operating and is located in the motor vehicle at a point forward of the back of the driver's seat
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.860]   or is operating in the monitor screen or display as visible the driver while driving.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:57.460]   That means everybody drives a Tesla is driving illegally. Yeah. Yeah, or anybody who has their
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:03.460]   phone mounted on the thing for navigation purposes, right? That's why I think she should fight it.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:09.140]   I mean, that's so vague. Like obviously, they don't want people having a TV sitting on the dash.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:14.020]   No, I think that's there are exceptions. You can drive with equipment that includes a mapping
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:18.500]   display and or a global positioning display. Oh, she should have argued.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.380]   There you go. It's a navigation. Look at Google Maps.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:28.980]   Oh, but you know, not not in her defense. I mean, we when you pick up glass, they made it very clear
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:32.740]   that you should not wear it while driving at the law. Not dated yet. You should not.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:36.340]   So she knew that she shouldn't have been. She said her glass was not on.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.180]   And the officer said it was blocking her view.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:48.340]   Well, really? It doesn't block your view, doesn't it? It's above your eye.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:53.140]   Yeah. You have to look at it's off. It's clear. It's clear. Right. Yeah.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:20:00.500]   I say fight it, California woman from San Diego. Fight it. Fight the good fight.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.740]   Stand up for glass holes everywhere. Yes.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:15.540]   Yes. We talked about the Post-it note that the Guardian displayed today of how the National
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:23.860]   Security Agency can watch what's going on at Google. Did you see it? It's kind of...
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.740]   No. What? Wait a minute. I got to find this.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:34.260]   You mean the drawing? It's a drawing. It's on a yellow. It looks like
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.180]   it has a happy face. It has a happy face on it. I got to show you this.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:42.500]   It's hysterical. We're spying on you. Happy face. Yeah.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:51.860]   I can't pull it up fast enough. Pull it up. There you go. Chad's better than me.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:54.980]   So this is a yet. This is another one. They're slowly leaking out.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.660]   Yet another slide from the NSA presentation. Except this one looks like it was drawn on a
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:04.980]   Post-it note. So they have a cloud on the left that is the public internet. The cloud on the right
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:10.740]   that is the internal Google cloud. In between them, a GFE, a Google front-end server. That would
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:16.420]   be hardware interfacing the public internet to the private. And then there's an arrow dotted arrow
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:21.860]   with the text SSL added and removed here. Exclamation mark with a smiley face.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:34.820]   Official NSA jargon for insert spy device here. That's the most sarcastic smiley face probably ever.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:46.580]   It actually, if you carefully observe, fits my face perfectly. I am Edward Snowden.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.060]   I was really believing these slides right up to that one, which looks like he drew it
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:03.220]   in a bar in Hong Kong. Really? At least the other ones were power points.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:08.340]   Yeah. Really? This is what? And the smiley face. Wow.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.140]   Yeah, the smiley face is... However, it does confirm what we do believe,
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:18.100]   which is that the NSA is tapping in at the unencrypted point of the transactions.
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:24.580]   Did you see the caption? Two engineers with close ties to Google exploded in profanity when they
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:31.780]   saw the drawing. Well, that doesn't tell you much. They could have been saying,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:40.100]   that's not true or why would you find that? Yeah, or that's who put a happy face on there.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:44.980]   Exploded in profanity does not tell you anything. It really doesn't.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:52.580]   But it sure looks like they're tapping into the connection to their cloud and probably,
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:58.740]   it would be... I don't know what we figured was happening. Yeah, it would be
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:09.300]   compatible with a Google explanation or denial. And technically, it makes it work.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:17.060]   Also, the project is called Muscular. Yes. And it's done in conjunction with the British GCHQ.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:24.180]   Isn't that nice? I did notice one thing interesting in Alan Russ Bridger from The Guardian wrote a
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.780]   big piece for the New York Review of Books about the Guardian and the series that it's been doing.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.500]   But he mentions way down. It's quite a long piece, but he mentions near the end that he was talking
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:40.020]   to a senior executive from a West Coast based technology company, which he didn't mention.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:51.460]   They admitted, this guy admitted, that he, neither he nor the CEO would have security clearance to
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:57.540]   even know about anything that was going on related to the NSA anyway. So that, in other words, their
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:02.900]   denials are sort of irrelevant because they're not the people who are doing it. They don't have
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.220]   the clearance to even know that it's occurring. Right.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:16.100]   I think this would be a good time for us to do a tool, a tip, and a number of the week coming up
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.580]   in just a bit. Tom Standage, he wrote the book, The Victorian Internet, which is a great book,
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:26.100]   his newest, is about social networks. 2,000 years of the history of social networks.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:32.100]   John Love, we're going to interview him in just a little bit. But first, let's get a tip from Gina
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:38.820]   Trippani. My tip this week is actually an app. So I guess it's kind of like a tool. And I apologize
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.180]   to the people who watch all about Android. This is just such a great app. It won the arena.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:49.380]   Last night, I wanted to bring it up to the Twig listeners. Pushbullet. Pushbullet.com. Love this thing.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:55.620]   I installed it to test it out and I've been using it so much. What Pushbullet does is it lets you
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:01.380]   push data from your computer, from Chrome to your phone very easily. It's very similar to Chrome to
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:07.860]   phone, actually, but with lots more features, a lot easier to use. So you install it on your
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.220]   Android device. You can install the Chrome extension into Chrome and you sign in with Google. So it's
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:21.700]   really simple. One click sign in. And then you can push lists, locations, text files, links,
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.900]   whatever you want to your Android phone. And it shows up in your notification shade. It's a rich
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:32.500]   notification. And when you tap on, say, for example, location and automatically loads Google Maps,
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:37.460]   if you tap on a list, you can check off items on the list. And you can also push between your
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:42.260]   Chrome browsers. If you want to push from one Chrome browser to another, it works to your tablet,
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:47.300]   to your phone. You can push to your friends' devices if they give you access. And it's just
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:50.740]   a really, really handy way. So like, if you're sitting at your desk and I do this all the time,
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.140]   I look up an address to a restaurant that I'm going to or a place I need to go. And I want an easy way
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:01.380]   to just send that to my phone on the way. I just click a button and it goes. Really, really
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.180]   beautifully designed Android only app uses the rich notifications Android 4.0 and above.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:11.620]   And just super, super useful. I love this app. I've been using it so much. I want to share it.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:15.700]   Push bullet. Yeah, because I always use Chrome to phone.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:19.460]   It's like it's Chrome to phone, but even better. Yeah.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.980]   Yeah. That looks cool.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:23.220]   Yeah, it's pretty cool. Pretty cool app.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:27.220]   Now, normally Jeff Jarvis would do a number of the week. We don't have Jeff's number of the week,
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:31.700]   but Matthew, if you have a tip or an idea or an app you like that you'd like to share with us,
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:37.060]   that's good too. And you see, I don't know how new this one is, but it's one that I've been using
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.340]   a lot because I, for backing up photos, it's called, it used to be called Open Photo.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:50.020]   And now it's called Trove Box. It's got iOS apps. It's got Android apps. It's got a website.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.900]   And the thing that appealed to me about it was that when it was called Open Photo,
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:27:00.020]   it's very open. So you can host your photos with them or you can host them on S3.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:04.100]   And it's just very seamless. It's got a really nice UI.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:12.580]   So I back up my photos to like 10 different places. So Google+, I've got auto upload turned on,
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:18.100]   Dropbox, I've got auto upload turned on just so that I never sort of lose them. But
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:23.060]   Trove Box has got quite a nice setup and I know that it's all backed up to my S3
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:27.460]   installation with Amazon. Yeah, so it's really well done.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:35.860]   I like it. Well, I already showed you my pick of the week, my little floating hat.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.820]   It's I really like.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.940]   Windy day.
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:44.580]   I like windy day and I hope that I look forward to more and I'm very excited about it.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:50.260]   I just feel like it's too bad that it's only Moto X, but because this is really and I think in
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:55.460]   some ways a new medium and I think there's a lot you could do to be very interesting. So if you do
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.420]   happen to have a Moto X and you don't see the little hat floating around on your screen,
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:05.220]   go get the Motorola spotlight app. It's on the Play Store downloaded and it won't be long
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:11.300]   before you have a windy day too. Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:14.900]   This week in Google shows up on the Twit Network every Wednesday,
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:19.940]   1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, the new time because we're setting our clocks back
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:27.140]   on Sunday, the new time will be 2100 UTC on Twit.tv. Please tune in lime and watch. We appreciate it.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:32.500]   Love the chat room. Very helpful. If however, you can't get here in person always,
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:39.300]   we always make on demand audio and video available afterwards at Twit.tv/twig or wherever you can
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:46.740]   subscribe to podcast. That way you get it each and every week. I can't remember. Are we moving
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:54.900]   this show in 2014 or not? I don't think so. We are not. We're not. Yeah, not that I'm aware.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.420]   I should let you know we are moving some shows so that I can have two days off Thursday and
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.900]   Friday. So some shows get moved, but Twig is not moving. It'll still be Wednesday at 1 p.m.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:07.460]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern. Gina is going to be missing in action though for the month of December.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:14.580]   She's moving. I am moving cross country and couch surfing. Back to Brooklyn. Holidaying and
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.780]   we'll be carless and day careless and sort of living a crazy life there in December. And freezing
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:24.580]   because you know, Brooklyn will be freezing. It's cold. It'll be worse. Could be kind.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:29.940]   But yes, that's true too. That's true. But I'll be back in January. Good. And we will have
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:36.260]   fill-ins throughout the months. Matthew among them, I hope. And of course, a best of, which we do
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:41.540]   every year. In fact, you can contribute to our best ofs for any of our shows. If you watch a show
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:46.820]   and you go, "Oh, there was a great moment." Remember that? Back in the spring when everybody was dancing,
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:54.340]   you can go to twit.tv/bestof and let us know. There's four fields on the form that you may not
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:59.220]   know. You know, time code, air date, that kind of thing. That's fine. Give us whatever information
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:05.060]   you can. And we'll see. We'll try to find it. And then we'll have a best of for Christmas week.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:10.660]   Because I think our show's on Christmas Day, actually. New Year's Day, we're doing a special
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:16.020]   24-hour New Year's party. Maybe you could stop by for that, Gina. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd like that.
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:23.380]   You could be our New York correspondent. Yeah. That'd be fun. Yeah. For any time, really. 4am
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:30.420]   Pacific time, New Year's Eve, to 4am Pacific time, New Year's Day. I will be on the air wearing a
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:36.180]   tuxedo, counting down and drinking champagne at least once an hour, if not more.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:42.660]   Well, seeing what the ice cream did to you, I can't wait to dance. I know! I'm going to be quite a show.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:50.340]   I'll sing, "You'll Never Walk Alone at the End," and loosen my tie and walk off the stairs.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.060]   I'm the lawyer standing by. Yeah. I'm the lawyer standing by.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:56.740]   No, I was thinking of getting a nurse to take my blood pressure every hour.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:04.820]   Do a blood breathalyzer. That's what we'll do. We'll have a CHP, a California Highway Patrol
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:12.580]   Officer, and a nurse standing by at all times. Thank you, everybody. Yeah, we're going to do
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:23.460]   a 24-hour. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.500]   [Music]
