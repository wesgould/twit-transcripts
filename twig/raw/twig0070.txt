[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.440]   and the Googleverse joining us as always.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.680]   Gina Tripani, well, almost always.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.320]   Gina Tripani from smarterwear.org, we'll see.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840]   Almost always, not always.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   Sometimes you miss a show.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.640]   Makes me sad.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.680]   I cry when you do.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.520]   I couldn't miss a show with you, Turkey's.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Oh!
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.720]   Big in a Turkey's.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.920]   Jeff Jarvis, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.400]   Is there-- is the smell of roasting Turkey waftings
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.560]   or the Jarvis home right now?
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.600]   No, we don't like Turkey.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   There you go.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.600]   You don't--
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.840]   You don't--
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.600]   --prey and tary-in in all things.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   I'm going to find out what you eat.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   Is it a big ham?
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.120]   One year, I suggested to my wife that we should save her effort.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.800]   And this is what her father and father were alive
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.480]   and get a tray of lasagna.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   Yes!
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.080]   I've never seen a sadder face than my grandfather in law
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   as he looked at it as if it were a dead dog.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.600]   Well, you know what my people do, and Gina's
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.480]   have people do too.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   We have the lasagna.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.560]   We have the oni pasta.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.320]   But then you have the turkey.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.440]   As if you haven't eaten enough.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   Exactly.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   There's always the oni pasta right in the pasta.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.760]   And any meal.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.680]   And any meal.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.800]   And then you have the turkey stuffing, sweet potatoes,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.520]   green beans, pumpkin pie, and a little cannoli.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.400]   No, yes.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.240]   And then espresso.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   But it lasts from noon until seven or eight at night.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.520]   Paison!
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.360]   Hey, speaking of Paison's, the great Om Malek is joining us
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.720]   this week.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.560]   It's great to see you Om from gigaom.com.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Are you doing, guys?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.240]   Pleasure to be back.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.640]   Do you?
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   Yeah, no turkey for me.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   I'm having tofu.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.640]   Tofu.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280]   Tofu, do you celebrate?
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.000]   Obviously, I don't know.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Diwali, what do you celebrate?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.280]   I celebrate everything.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.520]   This is a festival.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.080]   I'm in.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.720]   Life!
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.320]   If I celebrate life!
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   That's right.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.200]   You don't have enough of that.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   Om is a hard-working man, though.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.840]   Let me tell you, go to gigaom.com.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.480]   I don't know how people do blogs like that.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.080]   The news cycle is 20 seconds, not 20 hours.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.880]   And you're just constantly working to keep up with it.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   You know, we'd be learning from the master.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.600]   That is you.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   Oh, I don't do any reporting, though.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.120]   I just repeat what you guys say.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   I talk to Henry Bloggers.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.040]   Come on.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.240]   We don't do a notar-pouring.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.800]   Come on.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.040]   Haven't you wrecked the main site?
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   Somebody's--
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.680]   Somebody's--
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   Somebody's--
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   Somebody's--
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   Somebody's--
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.880]   Somebody's going to do some work.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.280]   I don't know who, but somebody's going to--
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   Hey, hey.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   What do Bloggers say?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   So, I'm curious if this follows your experience.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   He said that hiring new paper reporters
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.960]   is kind of a disaster because they come in.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   They want to drink their coffee, read the paper, go out
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600]   the lunch, come back, do one thing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.480]   One story a day.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.120]   What do you want?
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.640]   And then look at them like he's a slave driver.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.160]   Right.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.840]   You mean five?
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.400]   I got to file five times a day.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.720]   What are you talking about?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.440]   Well, we just went--
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.520]   I don't know what to say.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.440]   To each his own, I guess.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.120]   I think this is a different-- the new generation
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.480]   is very different from the previous generation
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   of journalists.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.240]   So, yes.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.920]   You kind of learn to live with those realities.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.160]   So Rupert Murdoch's reality is they're
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.000]   going to put together apparently with Apple
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.800]   an iPad-only newspaper called--
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   In a cut--
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   The Daily.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.760]   This is kind of--
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.520]   The Daily, but he may not get away with it
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.640]   because there are other claims to the name.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.200]   Well, and--
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.320]   Excuse me.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.200]   Are you going to update it daily?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's all he's going to do is daily.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.240]   Oh, that's pathetic.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.840]   Welcome to the internet, Rupert.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.680]   It's going to-- every night, somebody's
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.480]   going to hit a button just like they did on the goal.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.960]   No.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   No.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.680]   They're not going to update it like--
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.520]   It's going to-- it's going to-- once a day,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.240]   it's going to update.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.600]   Right.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   Because this is a replication of--
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.200]   I guess.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   --its old wine in new cask.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.520]   He says we're going to have--
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   I love this.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   We're going to have 100 reporters and six tech guys.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.160]   OK.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.360]   I told you Leo is drunk.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.840]   I wish I were drunk when I hear something like that.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.160]   So is 100 reporters enough?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.280]   What does USA Today have?
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.600]   What does the New York Times have?
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.560]   Is 100 reporters enough?
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.640]   Well, the Washington Post has--
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.240]   well, New York Times is ridiculous.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.960]   It has 2000.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.680]   Washington Post has about 750 Philadelphia Inquirer
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.560]   and Daily News about 500.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.440]   Star ledger these days, probably about 250.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.640]   So 100 is pretty scant for a national newspaper.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   And this is going to be iPad only and period?
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.760]   Yeah, 99 cents a week.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   And at least the price is right.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.680]   Don't you think, Jeff, that that's a good price?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.920]   I mean, if-- I look at The New Yorker, it's five bucks.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.200]   I look at The Economist.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.560]   These all these weeklies are charging huge amounts of money.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.320]   Yes.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   But Leo, you can get a kind of fast traveler
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   for a bucking issue if you subscribe.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   OK.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.680]   On the iPad, you mean?
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.360]   No.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well, I'm talking about the iPad.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   Oh, no.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   That's the irony of it.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.160]   In real life, you can get the print of magazine
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.720]   with all its beautiful photos and all that.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.680]   For bucking issue, you have to pay more on online.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   So I think 99 cents a week for a daily newspaper, I guess.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.080]   I guess we're just going to have to see what it is,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   what the quality is and all that.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.680]   And we will.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.320]   The economics of that are subscriber acquisition costs.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.720]   You have to pay marketing to bring people in.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.360]   When I worked on EW, I don't have a weekly,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.000]   it was costing anywhere from $20 to $30 per subscriber
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   in marketing cost.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   Wow.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   The production--
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.120]   And the big issue here is that I think not many people
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   are thinking about is the 100 reporters and six engineers.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   That is a model from the 20th century.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.480]   Today's model is 100 engineers and six reporters
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.040]   is how it's going to be.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   And unfortunately, the old media people
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.160]   don't quite get it that they're not
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   in the business of news.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.640]   They're in the business of information.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.400]   And information comes in many different ways,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.120]   in many different forms.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.720]   And as long as they don't quite get it,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.640]   they will continue to lose money and keep trying
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.960]   to bottle the old wine in a new bottle.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.040]   And they won't be successful.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.880]   I am hoping that this new project is actually
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.320]   going to be interesting because at least they're
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.880]   spending money and doing something new versus Wall Street
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.720]   Journal or New York Times, which looks essentially
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   the same thing as you can buy and print
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.800]   or on their website.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.600]   So there's nothing surprising about that.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.200]   So I hope they do come up with something interesting.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   There is an opportunity to do that.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.560]   If nothing else on a daily basis,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   if they have better gossip, I'm going to subscribe.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.440]   That's maybe all it takes.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.880]   Yeah, that's all I really want from me in a product.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.200]   He says it'll be a tablet.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.000]   Maybe, Jeff, you can figure this one out.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.040]   A tabloid sensibility with a broad sheet point of view
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.160]   or a tablet point of view with a broad sheet sensibility.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.320]   It's a mix of the two.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.080]   The broad sheets are what?
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.200]   Like the financial times, like the serious papers.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.640]   New York Times is the various times.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.760]   And the tabloids are obviously--
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.520]   I like the post.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.840]   --the sun and the post.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.520]   It's Murdoch.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   So it's going to have attitude.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.640]   He has Richard Johnson, ex-post there.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   He has an ex-editor of the post--
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.600]   and the manager of the post involved.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   So it'll have a posty attitude.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.760]   The thing about Murdoch is he loves making money,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.720]   but he does that through entertainment.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.040]   I know that with news publishing,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.000]   he has always said that what he really wants
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   is a bully pulpit, so-called.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.440]   He loses-- I don't know what the number is now-- more than $25
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.240]   million a year on the New York Post,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.560]   so that he has that bully pulpit.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   He overpaid crazy for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.160]   He has the bully pulpit.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.280]   I would guess he's making money on the Journal by now, right?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.760]   Hard to say.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.840]   There's no transparency at numbers at all,
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.560]   and no, no.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.120]   They discount the subscriptions very, very heavily.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.400]   It's a good ad category in good times, but right now,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.520]   not so much.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.080]   But the other thing Murdoch wants to do
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.160]   is he fancies himself the savior of the New Paper business
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.440]   when he broke the unions and broke the old work rules in London
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.040]   when he moved to this so-called whopping plant.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.400]   Always sounded a little obscene to me.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.600]   You're going to be yourself a good whopping.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.360]   And there's something from Charlie in the chocolate factory.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.200]   Something really wack, I might have a whopping plant.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.120]   We make wops there.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.040]   I guess I should have said that.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.320]   Hey, I didn't mean that.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.200]   WAP.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   Anyway, so now I think he thinks he's
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.560]   going to rescue the industry by saying, well, people should
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.280]   pay, and they should do what they used to do.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.760]   And so we're going to prove that works.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.120]   Well, good, friggin luck group.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.960]   So I've got an iPad with a full web browser,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.160]   and thousands of services that you put together
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.400]   a customized news page or an RSS reader kind of experience.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.040]   I go go read her, but I'm going to pay $0.99 to get the daily update.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.000]   Well, you might.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.560]   I mean, if I look at people who buy iPads and how they use it,
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.120]   I think that that's not necessarily untrue.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   I think that I could see those people
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.080]   paying a buck a week to have this beautiful experience.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.000]   I mean, isn't that kind of what the iPad is,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.480]   is for people who don't like the web?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.880]   Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.760]   It's a good point.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.240]   It's true.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.760]   The usage usage in the iPad is mainly the web.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.640]   Is it?
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.880]   Yeah, we had those stats in a few weeks ago on the list.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.640]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well, that's telling.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.640]   It's good.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.280]   It's good for the fate of the world.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   And I don't-- we didn't discuss it on the last week,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.800]   maybe since then.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.760]   But Tim Berners-Lee's magnificent essay in Scientific American,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.000]   he responded among other things to Wired magazine
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.920]   is that the web is not dead from the man who invented it.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   And he does decry and worry about the closed world of not
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.560]   just apps, but also Facebook and Great Measure Google
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   and others.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.760]   And as always, we're fighting for the openness of our world.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.280]   And we--
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.640]   I think the one thing which he can't ignore, Jeff,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.880]   I think, you know, Sir Tim is absolutely right
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.200]   when he brings up those issues.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.280]   But the problem is that all of us
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.240]   tend to measure the world today and the future
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.120]   from yesterday's measurement tools or yardsticks.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.920]   So what it was earlier is very different than the web.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.280]   It will be tomorrow, right?
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.400]   So you kind of say that we have an idea what it will be
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.520]   is quite different.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.080]   I mean, if you look at the Twitter app,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.800]   it has an embedded browser in it.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.040]   So how is the browser dead?
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.080]   Not really.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.600]   It just is different.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   It's a different packaging now.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.560]   It's a different sensibility.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.800]   And I think it's essentially--
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.440]   in many ways, if you really think about it,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.320]   the analogy I like to see that we're
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.000]   going from what used to be the Henry Ford world
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.520]   into a world where there are many cars, right?
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.680]   And essentially in different formats.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.480]   The essential idea of the internet is not changing.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.720]   The essential idea of internet as an information resource
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.480]   hasn't really changed.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.880]   What might change is how we view it.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.320]   That's not really saying the web is dead.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.960]   So in that sense, the guys from Wired
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   were very sensationalist.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.280]   And from that sense, Sir Tim is right.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.840]   But even he's also being a little bit alarmist.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.720]   The internet is by the people for the people.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.280]   Let people define what it will be, right?
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   So people at this very moment are defining apps
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   as a way to use it.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.480]   These are the same people who are on my space
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.240]   and they are on Facebook and they will be on something else
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.200]   tomorrow.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.360]   So I think the web is an organic thing.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.800]   It's a living thing.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.280]   And it changes.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.440]   And even just like any other organic living thing,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.720]   it's changing its skin, so to speak, right now.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.040]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.760]   That's a good thing from an innovation perspective.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   I think it's a good thing from the perspective
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.280]   of imagining new user experiences and new products.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.720]   So I like where we are going right now.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.840]   And I don't think we need to be alarmist about it.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.040]   Just remember five years ago, MySpace was the king.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.120]   Today, they basically have capitulated and said,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.560]   he will use Facebook log on to kind of let people in.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.160]   So Mark Zuckerberg and company cannot take it for granted
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.000]   that they will be around in 2015.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   - Not at all.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.640]   - I agree with you on, but at the same time,
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.120]   I think what Tim's saying, in fact,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.920]   the subtitle of his article is,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.320]   the web is critical, not merely to the digital revolution,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.680]   but to our continued prosperity and even our liberty.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.640]   And it needs defending.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.480]   He's calling for open standards, net neutrality,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.320]   things like that.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.480]   And I think people maybe, I don't know,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.120]   is it anti-democratic to say you can't trust people
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.840]   to act in their best interest in that way?
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   I think sometimes they--
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.880]   - But it's not people, the problem you're going to guess
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.200]   here is not people. - Business interest.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.240]   - The problem is the business interest
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.760]   and government interest, very importantly,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.040]   government interest as well.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.840]   - The government's acting in the interest of business
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.680]   in that case.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.880]   - They're also acting in the interest of being able
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.280]   to forcing businesses to hold our data
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.400]   so that they can do criminal investigations,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.320]   things like that.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.520]   And what Oum said, I absolutely agree with,
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.920]   but I think that we could lose it.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.240]   The web is of the people, the internet is of the people,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   but if we don't protect that,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.520]   cue my plug for Bill of Rights here,
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.400]   but if we don't protect the principles,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.200]   if we don't create principles and then protect them,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.640]   then it'll be our own fault when we lose them.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.400]   And I think that's what Sir Tim is saying.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.160]   - And we're the people, and this is the conversation
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   that's happening.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   I mean, this is part of that process.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.720]   So I agree with you, Oum, that that process,
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.240]   you know, is good, but I just sometimes,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.920]   some of us who maybe understand a little bit of the risks
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.280]   and here it might need to nudge
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.880]   a little bit in the direction of free, open, neutral,
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.480]   that kind of thing.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.040]   - Even nobody is arguing against free, open and neutral.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   What I'm arguing for is people should have the choice
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:08.240]   to access the web in whatever format they choose to, right?
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.240]   - Oh, of course. - Right?
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   Like, so it doesn't have, we don't have to view the web
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.200]   from the eyes of a browser that was created in 1994.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.600]   Essentially, nothing really has changed with the browser.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.880]   Nothing really has changed.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   You know, Gina can speak to that in terms of the tools
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   of creating great web experiences
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.160]   haven't really changed that much.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   The web itself is pretty, pretty much the way it was,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.680]   the way we discovered it.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.440]   You know, it's gotten a little prettier
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.600]   and they're using more pictures
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.680]   and a little bit more multimedia.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.880]   But what it hasn't changed is,
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   is the our human interaction with the web
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.320]   hasn't quite changed as much.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.000]   Whereas when you look at things like apps on iPad
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.840]   or on Android or whatever,
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.200]   you feel there is a little bit more immersion going on.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.480]   There is a new kind of a user interaction going on
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.320]   with these services.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.960]   So I think there is that element
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.480]   which we also have to remember.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.720]   That's how I feel about it.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   Well, I don't know what--
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.680]   - I love our apps, but I think the apps,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.760]   I mean, I would push for HTML5 and web-based apps
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.360]   and the market may not push in that direction,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.240]   especially people like Rupert Murdoch,
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.440]   who would like to control,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.960]   would like he wants the walled garden
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.320]   and that's what the daily is,
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.640]   is a walled garden, a paywall.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.640]   And I think this vision that Gina has of us bookmarking
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.240]   and going from site to site on our browser,
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.520]   that's what made the web so powerful.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.000]   It doesn't have to be a browser, I guess,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080]   or it could be a richer browser experience.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.720]   We're working towards that.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.920]   - I mean, the linking part of it
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   is the thing that's the most important.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.760]   - The link to the key.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.520]   - Even if I subscribe to the daily,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.440]   I couldn't ever blog about any of those stories,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.680]   which means it much less valuable to me as a blogger,
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.120]   'cause I can't blame, link or quote.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.320]   I can quote, but I can't link, it's not a linkable page
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.000]   that I know anybody can get to.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.640]   But I totally agree with all of them.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.760]   I think that these things evolve.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.040]   I do trust that people will interact with the web
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   in the ways that they want.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.520]   A lot of apps do have an embedded browser inside them
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.720]   when you are viewing content,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.000]   so it is kind of the browser and it is kind of the web.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.920]   - And for all we know, they might do that on the daily.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.320]   They might give you a share and link
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.480]   and who knows what they're gonna do.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.240]   But I might say-- - Yeah, I think they're not going to.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   - They say they're not going to.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.400]   - I think I've seen that,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.080]   but I don't know if that's from a source
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   or from somebody who knows. - Interesting.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.200]   - But you know, Sir, Gene, I think you're right, it's a link.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.280]   But what got me about, about,
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.680]   Berger's Lee's piece is he turned it around
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.520]   to the, to the, to the principle here, which is the URI.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.480]   And that anything that's online without a URI
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   is not gettable through search or through links
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.680]   or through analysis.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.360]   And that the principle should be
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.200]   that everything has a URI.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.160]   - Right, there's a standard way to fetch content.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.320]   Yeah. - Exactly.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.040]   - Absolutely. - Okay, so as people,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.760]   who are in the technology industry,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.040]   let me push, push back on that.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.080]   Why do we have to have this notion of URI?
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.280]   Why can't we have this notion of everything being a social
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.000]   object, which can be all mashed together, right?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.840]   - That's what a URI is. - That's what a URI is.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.360]   - That's what a URI is. - No, but that's the event.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.920]   - An wavelength. - Right, but it is just like,
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.240]   we are looking at URI from an older perspective.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.480]   I think in the future, it might mean entirely different
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.720]   than what it is today.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.160]   - Well, in fact-- - You know, it doesn't have
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.280]   to be linked as in book market can be linked.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   - No, absolutely. - No, I can't.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.000]   - But these in a dress. - And like you can't,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.520]   you can't see it as an object if you can't address it.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.320]   - And in the world that Rupert Murdoch would like to create,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.200]   you can't, he doesn't want it the free flow
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.240]   of this movement back and forth.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   He wants you to come in, look at it--
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.720]   - You say with the Zuckerberg.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.840]   - And really that's what Facebook's moving towards.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.960]   Although, I would say that Ohm is probably
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.440]   more satisfied by what Mark's doing,
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.200]   'cause at least it's got, it's social, right?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.120]   Maybe it's-- - Yeah, I'm just speaking
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.920]   to Tim Berger's Lee's issue there, which is--
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.600]   - This is what I was saying about Facebook all along.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.480]   And I'm really glad he articulated it,
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.960]   'cause I think he did a very good job with it.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.720]   - Yeah, I think the, you know, as far as the Murdoch
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.600]   experiment with the Daily, if you can share it,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.480]   if you can link it, well, it's gonna be not that relevant.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   I have to be honest. - Nice, yes.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.320]   - I mean, that's how people like to share information
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.880]   and things and articles and stuff.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.280]   And if you can do it, well, you know, it clearly,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.520]   you know, you can get a Botox injection
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.480]   that doesn't make you 16 years old.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.840]   (laughing)
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.240]   - Well, it's this idea that the requirement is
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.720]   you have to be participating in a proprietary platform.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.600]   Whether that's, I have to have a Facebook account
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.280]   to do something or I have to have an iPad with this app.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.640]   It's just this, you know, everyone has access to the web
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.960]   and it's a free and public resource.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.120]   So it's just that, you know, how are you gonna share
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.080]   daily articles?
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.680]   I mean, it's pretty much gonna be an ad for the Daily.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   It's gonna say download, download this app and subscribe
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   in order to see this.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.360]   It's, honestly, it's not gonna go anywhere.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   - Right, it is certainly Murdoch's option.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.520]   It is his right in privilege to do exactly
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.920]   the structure he's doing.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.080]   I have no problem with that whatsoever.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.760]   And if somebody figures outpaid,
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.600]   that's probably a fine thing too.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.280]   I just would not bet a penny on it.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.560]   That's all. - I agree.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.680]   We're talking about, we'll get to talking about Google
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   and just a little bit, apparently,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.960]   they offered to buy Twitter for some good money.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.160]   We'll talk about that in just a second,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.760]   but first I wanna mention our-- - Not enough.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.960]   - Not enough.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.360]   I am insulted. (laughs)
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.000]   - Sir. - Sir.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.940]   You have insulted my honor.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.960]   Before we do that though, I'd like to talk a little bit
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.480]   about the full-out focus and the great drive one challenge,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.360]   the global focus test drive.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.720]   Don't get mad at me, but this link,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.080]   twitfourdfocus.com goes right to a Facebook page.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.480]   That's how Ford wanted to do it, okay?
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.080]   But it is actually, it's a lot of fun.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.040]   The new focus is coming out at the 2012.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.200]   I've seen it already.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   It is spectacular and it's Ford's world car.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   It will be the same essential model all over the world.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.680]   It's the first time Ford's done that
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.800]   and it's very exciting.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.880]   Boy, is it a good-looking car.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.760]   You've heard about the EcoBoost engines
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.280]   they're putting in these, the V6 engines
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   with a lot of horsepower, but very great gas mileage.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.240]   That's in the Tourist's show.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.000]   You've heard us talk about the 2011 Fiesta,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.880]   the most fuel-efficient compact car in the road today,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.600]   40 highway miles per gallon,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.520]   and this new Ford Focus is gonna blow people's mind.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.640]   Wait till you see it.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.200]   Now through December 31st, 2010,
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.760]   go to twitfourdfocus.com and create a video
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.160]   saying why you would like to drive the new Ford Focus.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.520]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.840]   Ford will send $10,000 to the charitable cause
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.800]   of your choice if you win and send you and a friend
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.680]   on a free trip to a secret location
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   somewhat in Europe to test drive the all new 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.600]   Pretty cool, huh?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.800]   Learn more and what you should submit in the entry.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.640]   Go to twitfourdfocus.com
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.200]   and you can submit the video right there.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.040]   Less than two minutes,
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   explain why you wanna be one of the first to test drive
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   the 2012 Ford Focus and how you'd start something more
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.320]   for a good cause of the local market equivalent
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.360]   of 10,000 US dollars.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.040]   So it's worldwide, really cool.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.400]   Twitfourdfocus.com and I'm excited about Ford,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.200]   the new Ford Focus and of course that great Ford Sync.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.600]   It is such a beautiful car.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.400]   They had it at the blog world
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.920]   and it is just spectacular.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.960]   Thank you, Ford, for your support of this week in Google.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   So, Google offers two and a half billion dollars for Twitter.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.360]   And according to Business Insider,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.440]   is Evfelt insulted that they would offer so little.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.000]   Then somebody else comes along and says,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.200]   "Well, what about four billion?
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.760]   "Are you kidding me?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.560]   "How much is Twitter worth?
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.640]   "If Facebook's worth 35 billion."
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.720]   - No, 40 now.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.360]   - 40? I can't keep track.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.440]   - There's derivatives being drawn in the stock
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.880]   'cause it's such a high demand, which is what it is.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.120]   It's artificial in the difficulty of high demand.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.280]   But yeah, the latest valuation is 40.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.800]   - Wow.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.480]   - It seems like, I don't know much about this stuff.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.240]   It seems like anything under 10 billion for Twitter
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.000]   would be kind of insulting.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.200]   And it sounds like this 2.5 billion price
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.080]   was just sort of floated in a conversation.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.440]   I mean, I remember Ev, founded Blogger
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.560]   and sold Blogger to Google.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.720]   So they've done kind of business deals with him before.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.240]   I'm sure that he's in, he's in touch
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.440]   with lots of folks at Google.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.880]   And maybe they were just, you know,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.240]   they were kind of chatting over drinks.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.320]   But yeah, 2.5 seems crazy.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.960]   - Is it crazy?
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   - Do your sources, I'm saying that that actually
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.480]   was it an offer or what?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.640]   - I have no idea.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.720]   And you know, they're out raising money
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   apparently at 3 billion dollar valuation.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.120]   So why would they sell for two and a half?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120]   - Right.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.680]   - And I don't think they need to,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.040]   and I don't think they should,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.800]   given that all the people involved in this company
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   have had a pretty good successful run
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.920]   in their previous lives, right?
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.560]   - It's a good team.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.040]   - Right, on top of that, there we see,
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.200]   you know, if you look at Fred Wilson,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.960]   you know, he isn't doing too shabbily
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.000]   between Zinga, Twitter, Etsy and a bunch of others.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.240]   His fund is already, you know,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.440]   returning money like many times over.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   So he doesn't need to push this company to exit like tomorrow.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.640]   And same is with some of his other investors.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.560]   So, you know, I think they should, in my opinion,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.040]   go for it.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.720]   Like, I mean, you know, how often does an entrepreneur,
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.240]   you know, sit on top of a platform,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.960]   which changes everything, right?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.400]   So, which is fast growing, which has momentum,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.960]   and it has an impact on what close to 200 million people.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.840]   And I think that is where, you know,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.400]   the guys from Twitter should be thinking
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.320]   because this is like once in a lifetime,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.520]   opportunity to create something,
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.040]   which is a long-term value,
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.520]   I think they should actually learn the lesson
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.440]   of Mark Zuckerberg, you know, not get out too early.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   - Mark got out too early?
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.560]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no example.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.200]   - Oh, follow us example.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.240]   - Yeah.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.400]   - Because he did real.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   And, you know, you look at, well, Fred had delicious,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.720]   which went out for, I think the number was 40 million.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.960]   And, you know, it was kind of, oh, okay.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.240]   You know, you understand the entrepreneur who says,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.840]   who goes home and says, "Honey, I think I'll turn down
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.040]   "of 40 million dollars today."
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.960]   And she says, "Are you nuts?"
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:50.520]   You know, I get that, but it's about vision here.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.600]   And certainly, Ev and company can afford the vision.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.920]   And they should-- - Yeah, and they don't need the money.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.240]   I love it that they don't need the money,
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.080]   and so they don't have to push to exit.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   That's one of the problems right now,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.160]   or it has been one of the problems
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.480]   with the tech marketplaces that's always pushed to exit.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.800]   - Right, and I think there's a lot of marginal thinking
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.120]   going on right now.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.680]   I hate to say this, but, you know,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.040]   people have to think for the long term.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.080]   People have to think big.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.200]   You know, the value is about big ideas
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.000]   and big dreams and building big things.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.040]   If you don't do that, then we don't, you know,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.560]   then we don't find, you know, for the lack of a better example,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.920]   Oracle, we don't have the next Google,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.880]   we don't have the next Intel,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.320]   we don't have the next Infonearer, right?
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.680]   We people need to dream big.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.200]   We, you know, play for the long term.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.680]   We have to do that, and I think, you know,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.960]   the guys from Twitter are smart if they're going for it.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.360]   Like, you know, the worst case scenario
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.440]   is that it doesn't work out.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.600]   Well, it didn't work out for my space either, you know?
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.240]   So, I mean-- - Well, no, it didn't work out
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.760]   for the owners. - For the owners, yeah.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.160]   - Right, but Murdoch died for-- - It didn't work out
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.200]   for $4 million for it, it's Murdoch, the case.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.560]   - Right, but like, it didn't really work out as a service, right?
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.080]   So that's your downside. - Right.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.160]   - It works in downside for everyone. - Right.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.520]   - Everybody else, that they won't have, you know,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.240]   a few billion dollars versus the chance
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.800]   to live their dream, come on.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.640]   - Right, and look at some of the things people are doing.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.680]   Look at this Tim Burton exquisite corpse project,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.360]   Kadavra, exquisite.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.760]   He is, you know, I tried to do this with Molly Wood
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.200]   and Tom Merritt, we had a Twitter account called novel 140,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.240]   and we took turns adding a sentence,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.160]   but it went all over the place because, you know,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.200]   and we all were competing with each other.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.960]   So here's what you do, you tweet what you would like
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.040]   the next line to be, but then they vote on which one is the best
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.280]   and the story will get told.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.440]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.000]   I mean, it's obviously a publicity ploy,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.680]   but it's still very interesting.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.400]   - Should I-- - 20 needs more games.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.000]   - Yeah, exactly, it's fun.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.600]   - Yeah. - Stainboy using his obvious expertise
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.520]   was called in to investigate the mysterious glowing goo
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.480]   in the gallery floor.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.000]   That's how it started.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.520]   And then the subsequent tweets started two days ago.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.000]   So you can really get, you can still get it on this,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.580]   although it's gone quite a ways down.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.520]   I like this, I think it's a great idea.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.520]   And you can, if you go to the page, which is BurtonStory.com,
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.440]   you can see the tweets, the candidate tweets,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.760]   so, but what people are tweeting so far,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   and then, you know, see how the story is coming out.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.320]   I love it.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.760]   I guess use the tag, the hashtag BurtonStory.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.000]   You can follow it on Twitter @burtonstory.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.120]   I doubt it, I mean, I don't know if I know, come of it,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.720]   but I just think it's a really fun idea.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.480]   More games, I agree. - Yeah, he was.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.320]   - Hey, West Coasters, did you get to watch
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   Fred Wilson V. John Doar at Web2.0?
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.640]   - Well, I was busy. - I did.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   - I watched it on video.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.000]   - And? - What'd you think?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.560]   - You know, I'm actually a big fan of Fred now.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.080]   I am too, that's what I came out with, is the John.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.840]   - So what was the debate? - What was the debate?
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.400]   Whether there's a bubble?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.280]   - Yeah, I put it as the simplest level, yes.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.640]   And it was California versus East in attitude,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.920]   and Fred was just, I think, more mature and sane about it.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.240]   And, you know, they were very respectful to each other,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.680]   but they also disagreed a lot.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.360]   What'd you think of them?
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.760]   - I agree with you on, I think Fred Wilson
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.840]   is the social generations, John Doar.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.640]   - Yeah, John's kind of old-haired now.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.680]   - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I don't mean
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.160]   no disrespect to John, but I think,
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   I'm sorry, Fred actually understands social
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:52.000]   much better than some of his sandal road counterparts.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.560]   - Both of these, we should explain for those who are not
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.240]   in the know, these are both major venture capitalists.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.360]   John Doar, a little bit of the earlier generation though,
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.400]   yes.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   - Yeah, and Fred, because of his links with delicious,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.280]   and Etsy, and Kickstarter, and Twitter, and Zinga,
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.920]   he understands social so much more deeply and intuitively
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.720]   that he knows what he's talking about.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.320]   And so when the conversation, when he was actually
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   talking about, I think he might have been
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.280]   sounding the alarm about 12 to 14 months too soon.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   - That maybe on Fred.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.640]   - So I don't want to talk.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.000]   - Fred's not so much selling alarm at all.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.560]   I think I see what you're saying on him,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.880]   but I don't think he's so much sounds alarm,
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.440]   but he always pulls back.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.400]   He always, he has a caution about him.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.760]   And I don't think it's an alarm,
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.320]   I think it's just the way Fred is.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.080]   - Jim D. Daedrichson in our chat room says,
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.800]   if Facebook's worth $40 billion,
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.840]   $5 per human on the planet,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.640]   I'm pretty sure there's a tech bubble.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.280]   (laughing)
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.000]   - That's a good point, isn't it?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.240]   - But the bubble we're talking about here
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.800]   is an investing bubble, a VC bubble, I think, yes.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   Or an angel bubble.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.880]   - Yeah, it is an investment bubble.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.600]   - I mean, is there a, I mean,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   'cause we don't have IPOs anymore virtually,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.840]   so you can't say there's a stock bubble anymore.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.440]   - Well, it's an inefficient marketplace
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.760]   in this pre-IPO market,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.720]   that's why Facebook is so overpriced,
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.880]   is because it shouldn't be scarcer.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.160]   - Yeah, good point, very good point.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.000]   It's all those derivatives that are driving the value up.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.600]   - Good news for you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.560]   Wi-Fi Galaxy Tab coming to Best Buy,
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   49. - No, no, no, no,
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   it's the opposite.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.440]   - Well, okay, well, that's the first part.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.760]   The second part is nevermind.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.600]   (laughing)
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   - Exactly, sorry, I made your plug a lot.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.160]   - No, you didn't, no, you didn't.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.000]   I was just gonna get your hopes up and then dash them.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.240]   - That was all, I think I was--
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.320]   - Oh, I dash them myself.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.960]   I took the picture of that notice in a Best Buy
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.720]   and it spread a fair amount this week,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.000]   but it said that oops, our circular was wrong
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.200]   because Samsung pulled it back.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.000]   - Yeah, not Best Buy's fault.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.320]   - No, which I mean, probably is not Samsung's fault either,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.360]   it's probably the carriers.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.720]   - Oh, you think the carriers are fighting them?
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.560]   - Yeah.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.920]   - Yeah, 'cause that's what you want as a Wi-Fi.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.000]   By the way, I love the Galaxy Tab,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.080]   I think it's a great form factor,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.800]   it's very nicely made, the screen is fantastic,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   it is a great Android platform and I know,
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.440]   we talked about this last week, I know Google said--
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.720]   - There are a lot coming.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.800]   - No, there's no butt.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.000]   - That's good, 'cause I'm about to do it, I'm gonna do it.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I went out and I bought, I had to go all over
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.440]   Hell's Half Acre to find the Virgin Wi-Fi.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.360]   - Yes. - $40 a month.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.520]   - $40 a month, yep.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.920]   - You cannot find it anywhere, I drove 40 miles a day
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.000]   and got a flat tire, I was--
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.840]   - Wow. - How much you threw
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.160]   the snow with the no. - Wow.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.480]   - You get my Wi-Fi and so I'm gonna do that
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   and I might still buy the carrier enabled device
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.360]   just so I have kind of the option,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.720]   but then not use the plan.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.280]   - Right. - That's my current plan.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.120]   So I pay $100 premium to do some--
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   - You don't have to activate it,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.440]   but then you have 3G in there,
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.240]   which carrier would you use in your neck?
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.640]   - That's what I was about to ask you, boss.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.440]   - I think Verizon for New York, right?
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.160]   - They might have guessed.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.560]   You've got Verizon, all of them have it, AT&T, T-Mobile.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.640]   - Here's the only questions.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   - Right, abandoned Virgin.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   (laughs)
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.840]   - Here's the deal, you should understand
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.760]   that your Virgin is Sprint.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.840]   - Yes, but I want tethering.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.600]   Right, I wanna be able to power my laptop.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.800]   I don't wanna have to have more than one.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.640]   - Right.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:46.240]   I'm really thinking that since you've already got Sprint,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.680]   if you got the Verizon in there,
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.240]   it would also give you more flexibility, right?
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.360]   - Right, right.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.880]   - So Jeanna, you're still not gonna do it
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.280]   until Google blesses it.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.880]   - She's waiting for Gingerbread.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   - Yeah, while I'm waiting, well, honeycomb
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.280]   is supposed to be the tablet.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.120]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.320]   Gingerbread's two, three, and honeycomb is three-o.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.160]   - It's three-o, yeah, yeah, I'm hanging in there.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.760]   Although I did buy the Kinect this week,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.440]   I decided to get this for a Disney crap.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.640]   - And which game-- - My own resort.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.080]   - Which game is-- - Dance Central.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.800]   - Isn't Dance Central awesome?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.640]   - It's awesome.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.680]   - Stand up, let's do it, okay?
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.640]   We sang last week, we danced this week.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.320]   There's so many silly-- - It's a good snap.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.200]   - Yeah, it's kind of silly.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.360]   - Yeah, it's really silly.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   - It's a poopy right now.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.560]   - Oh, it says he celebrates all the time.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.520]   Dance Central is a celebration.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.080]   - Yeah, so I decided to wait on the tablet.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.560]   I'm probably gonna wait on the tablet solo,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.240]   because there's gonna be an Apple announcement in January
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   as well, I'm interested to see what the--
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.640]   - There'll be an iPad, yeah.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.480]   Yeah, there'll be an iPad.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.040]   - So I'm gonna hold out a little while longer,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.960]   but I have to say, I am, it's been hard.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.600]   And Gadget says 600,000 galaxy to actually Samsung's name,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.560]   so worldwide, that's a good number.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.560]   It's, you know, I wish it had a little bit better camera.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.680]   I don't understand why it's a 3.2 megapixel camera.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.200]   Really ought to be a five or an eight in there.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.600]   But other than that, that's the only thing
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.000]   I don't like about it, it's really well made, very solid.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.840]   - That's good to hear it.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.520]   - Great screen. - So we got a new one
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.280]   just now, right, it was, who was it?
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.520]   - Oh, there's a ton of them coming out.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.960]   - Yay, sir. - Oh, the eight,
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.440]   yeah, Acer's announced several swarm factors too,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.840]   which is very interesting.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.600]   - Two operating systems, three form factors.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.480]   - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   - And choices. - Yeah.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.080]   - For Android. - Yeah.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.280]   - Where are you on tablet ownership?
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.920]   - Oh, he's got a galaxy, how do you like it?
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.760]   - Sorry.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.960]   And it has Wi-Fi, I don't know why people
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.800]   are complaining about it.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.560]   - No, it has it, they just don't wanna pay the carrier 3G.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.920]   So we want Wi-Fi only, not, not--
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.280]   - 4.99 instead of 5.99, which you--
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.240]   - Right, it's like a Wi-Fi only iPad basically.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.800]   'Cause there's an awesome little device called the iPad,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.280]   you should just own that.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.920]   - Yeah, stop complaining. - He famously sent it back.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   He did a re-boxing.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.080]   - You know, there is a lot of things I love about Jeff,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.240]   that is not on the pen.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.200]   (laughing)
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   He's been holding this in.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.960]   - I like Android a lot, I think the iPad is very nice.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.800]   I don't know if anybody needs either,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.440]   to be honest with you.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.200]   I mean, I think a good phone with a big screen
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.360]   is probably sufficient.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.040]   - I would agree with you on that.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:28.680]   I actually, I only use my iPad for reading, that's it.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   And the iPhone, I have the Blackberry,
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.280]   which is a pain to use because of the browser.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.960]   So I end up carrying either an Android device,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   or I have a Wi-Fi with an iPhone without a SIM card.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.640]   And I use that for surfing the web.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.920]   But it is definitely a pain to have,
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   like an iPad is not that useful in versus an iPhone.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.280]   - It doesn't replace, it doesn't for me replace a laptop.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.280]   - No, actually it does replace the laptop.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   - It does, okay, that's good.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.840]   - Yeah, but it doesn't replace the phone, right?
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.640]   Like a lot of people have thought that they won't have
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.680]   to carry a phone or a smartphone,
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.120]   and they'll just carry a regular phone.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   - Why not?
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.880]   That was one of the things when I held this Galaxy Tab,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.400]   I thought, "If I had a phone in this,
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.800]   "I'd be a little happier."
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.320]   I guess you can use Skype or something.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.600]   - Yeah, but it just doesn't quite work.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.560]   - I feel to me like that, why doesn't Apple put a phone
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.080]   in the iPad or somebody put a phone in a tablet?
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.360]   - Yeah.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.880]   - If you're gonna carry it around, why not?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.240]   - So I'm thinking about switching to just a plain basic
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.080]   phone very soon.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.240]   - So you just have a phone and then a smart something else?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.960]   - And just either an iPad or maybe one of these tab,
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.360]   or you know Samsung devices.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.080]   - It's interesting, that makes sense.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.920]   Why not?
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.200]   - It's like, I don't like, I've just seen the number
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.720]   of minutes I use on the phone has gone down
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.440]   to like less than 300 minutes.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.800]   - That's the key, me too, I'm down to 150 a month.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   People probably use phones at all.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.200]   - Or I use like Skype all the time.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.560]   - Skype, on Skype, texting.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.280]   - Texting a lot.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.040]   Those services, yeah, we communicate just as much.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.680]   We just don't do it and phone calls as much.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.880]   - You know, I think the best thing I did was actually
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.520]   sent an iPhone to my parents.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.240]   So now they have Skype on it.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.560]   So it's great, like so we don't even have to worry about.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.040]   The only downside is my mom calls me from India
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.840]   pretty strange times.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.560]   So I've been talking about notifications.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.400]   But otherwise it's just a great, great little lap
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.520]   and a great little device for her.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.280]   So we talk a lot.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.440]   - If Google Voice did everything,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.720]   was a full implementation on the tablet,
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.880]   that would be enough.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.400]   - Yeah, I think Google Voice, if it worked,
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.600]   would be fantastic.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.440]   - Right.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.560]   (laughs)
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.400]   - If it worked.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.920]   - It worked for me.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.000]   - Google Voice, yeah, it works most of the time.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.520]   There's a once in a while I get that I can't connect a call.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.360]   But for the most part it does work.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.960]   - You know I wouldn't be surprised if we saw phones
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.320]   and tablets in version three and version four.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.760]   I mean I think Apple holds back these things like cameras
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.320]   and that kind of thing just so they have something
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.240]   to release the next year.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.880]   I wouldn't be surprised as the market absorbs more tablets
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   and gets used to having tablets
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.360]   if we don't see one with a phone option and a headset.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.840]   - Acer's Android smartphone is 4.8 inches.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.760]   We mocked the Dell Streak.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.200]   It's a little smaller than a Streak,
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.520]   a little bigger than the Evo or a Droid X.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.320]   But I like the 1024x480 screen.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.960]   - I think they have a seven inch antenna.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.760]   - Yeah, they're really covering.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.680]   I think this is smart.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.400]   Acer's just covering though.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.080]   And I don't know, I feel fine with 2.2
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.120]   on one of these devices.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.920]   I don't know what Google,
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.760]   I don't know what three will bring to the table that.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.640]   - Who got the Nexus 1 2.2 1 update this week
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.800]   and freaked out and thought that it was gingerbread
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.480]   and was jumping up and down in the living room.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   - Oh, yeah, me too.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.240]   (both laughing)
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.720]   - 2.21.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.600]   - It's like the side of the little robot
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.800]   and the unpacking box was so exciting.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.360]   And then there's like nothing visibly different
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.200]   about the update.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   It's just a security update.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.720]   - I really shouldn't do that.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.120]   - But I heard December 6th getting a day
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.040]   getting floated for gingerbread starting to roll out.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.880]   So.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.440]   - For gingerbread, but not honey.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.200]   - Honeycombs win later this year or next year.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.280]   - Mm, not sure.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.600]   - No, gingerbread should be.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.320]   Gingerbread should have been any minute now.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.520]   They put the freaking statue on the lawn.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.440]   - I know, the statue's on the lawn, exactly.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.600]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.960]   (both laughing)
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.520]   Come on, Google.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.960]   We should have some of you Leo first.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.520]   - Let's just put the statue on the lawn.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.720]   You gotta chip it.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.560]   - Yeah.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.880]   - Uh, let's see.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.560]   - I wish I had a better browser on my blackberry.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.320]   - No, get rid of that piece of crap.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.240]   - Yeah, what do you need to use in a blackberry for?
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.640]   - Speaking of old models, old wine.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.040]   - He's the Rupert Murdoch of cell phones.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.960]   - Yeah.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   - Oh, geez.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   It works.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.320]   It's a phone which will ring you.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   - Tough crowd, oh, tough crowd.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.160]   - Yeah, but seriously, without a browser,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.360]   I mean, a crappy browser is kind of very, you know,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.200]   last century.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.040]   - It's got BBM, man.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.200]   I got like so many people on BBM.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.760]   - Just BBM, what is that?
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.960]   - Blackberry messenger.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.400]   - Oh, blackberry messenger.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.320]   - It's like the MCI mail of RA.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.000]   - Yeah, blackberry messenger.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   Oh.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.680]   - Come on.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.240]   You know, you should be talking about MCI mail.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.800]   (laughing)
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.200]   - What was my MCI mail handle?
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.120]   It's not your name, right?
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.840]   It was like a number, wasn't it?
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.680]   - Yeah, it was.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.040]   - I just contacted you, sir.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.880]   - No, I contacted you, sir.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.920]   Yeah, I was 7-2-5-1-0.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   I can't, I'm.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.440]   - 7-1-1-1-1-1-3-4.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.160]   - 7-5-4-3-4, comma 1-3-0-4.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   - You never forget that crappy number.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.480]   - Dang.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.880]   I still...
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.320]   - 7-5-1-0-6, comma 13-34.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.800]   - And Gina's too young.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.000]   - She doesn't know what we're talking about.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.880]   (laughing)
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.400]   - No comment.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.680]   - You never had a modem coupler
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   that you would jam the hand set into
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.560]   and never had that.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.440]   - No, I, yeah, no.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.520]   I was in college.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.440]   - Even when you were a kid.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.880]   - I thought my first kind of ISP was, yeah.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.320]   - Google's CEO Schmidt says,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.280]   no Chrome OS or netbooks for Christmas.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.360]   - Ooh, ooh, scrooge.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.520]   - Well, you know, I think if I'm Google,
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.320]   I'm gonna watch and see what happens with Android, aren't I?
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.160]   - I don't know.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.640]   Do you think this is a planned thing?
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.440]   This sounded more like we slipped on our deadlines.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   - They did imply that they'd be this year, didn't they?
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.960]   - They kind of did.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.720]   And I have to say reading the story, I was like, wow,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.560]   they just, they announced Chrome OS way too early.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.240]   Like it's just been too long now, I think.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.600]   But they didn't say that he,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.920]   they said they didn't, he didn't really give a reason why.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.480]   But I don't know if they're holding on on purpose.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.640]   That he said that the Chrome OS is for devices
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.480]   with the keyboard, right?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.040]   And Android is for touchscreen, so.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.240]   - So it's gonna be a netbook, right?
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.440]   - They're sticking to it, right?
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.320]   It's gonna be a netbook.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.800]   I'm just surprised they didn't make it up by Christmas.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.040]   I assume that they would.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.200]   - I wouldn't wanna make a netbook right now.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.040]   I wouldn't wanna be selling netbooks right now, would you?
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.880]   - Oh.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.200]   - This is a lousy time to sell a netbook.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.040]   - That's true, good point.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.440]   - I think that market collapsed.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.000]   - Good point.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.160]   Apple made one, I mean, Apple just announced,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.000]   I mean, what?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.240]   - Oh, the year is not a netbook.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.120]   The year is a thing of beauty and joy forever.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   It's a thousand dollar netbook.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.920]   - It's a thousand dollar netbook.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.360]   - Has it just a tiny bit smaller than you would be?
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.720]   - Joey Cloud?
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.120]   - Yeah, what's that?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.960]   - Well, you don't even know,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.160]   oh, you need to play with it.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.840]   It's a, to read Crims OS,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   it's free web-based, lots of apps on it.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   You really should take one of your many netbooks
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.560]   and I haven't played with it much yet.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.120]   I got it down, but I'm curious.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.640]   It's a cool OS.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.960]   - Is Linux-based?
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.760]   - Yeah.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.960]   - I think Google should have just bought that
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.400]   and put the Chrome OS to take out on it and end with it.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.840]   - I think you're exactly right on, yep.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.840]   - Because it has the whole architecture of running apps
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   and making it very easy for all the rules.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.480]   - Yeah, that's key, isn't it?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.320]   - Yeah.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.160]   - You have to look importantly,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.800]   there's a Space Invaders icon on the desktop.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.400]   - I think that's very interesting.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.240]   - That's very interesting, yeah.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.600]   - I just, that's, yeah.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.160]   - It is actually pretty legit,
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.440]   so it's worth trying on.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.640]   - I tried all, you know, for a while I tried the Intel,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.360]   did something and there were a lot of different
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.320]   kind of competing and they were all just kind of junky.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.160]   So I kind of gave up, I liked the Ubuntu netbook remix,
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.320]   I thought that was good.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.160]   So I'll try.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.960]   - This goes way beyond just being another Linux build.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.320]   - It should actually be an environment.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.760]   - I think netbooks are gonna be the hula hoops.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.760]   - Of this past year.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.480]   I think that you're gonna look back and go,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.320]   what were we thinking?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.400]   - The eight track player.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.480]   - Yeah.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.200]   What were we thinking?
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.360]   - So I've got some very good news for Gina in just a second.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.560]   We gotta run because we gotta get going here.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.440]   But, 'cause we got another show,
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.760]   I'm running a little bit late.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.280]   But I do want to mention our good friends
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.000]   at squarespace.com who make sites so easy to build.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.640]   If you're looking to create a new website,
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   go to squarespace.com/twig.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.560]   And play with it.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.160]   They call it the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.200]   And I'd have to agree,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.840]   squarespace just is so beautiful, so elegant.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.720]   It's hosting plus software.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.040]   So that's kind of the deal.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.560]   Not free, but in a way, I don't mind not being free
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.080]   because I want to know that this place,
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.960]   that's gonna be around,
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.800]   and that's very affordable, it's $12 a month.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.080]   That's the starting price.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.000]   You get a lot of features for $12 a month.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.760]   And if you use the offer code Twig,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.560]   you get 10% off for the life of your account.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.520]   But also try it first.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.360]   That's the main thing.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   Go to squarespace.com/twig, click the green button,
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.440]   and try it for free.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.640]   You'll be able to import your existing site in.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.080]   They've got importers for all the major platforms.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.880]   No credit card needed, just the site name, the password,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.760]   an email address for recovery, and your capture,
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.280]   and you're ready.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.760]   And 60 plus great templates are gonna give you a great start,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   and then you can do with drag and drop in Ajax,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.680]   anything that you want to make your site look unique
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.800]   and beautiful and something you'd be proud of.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.600]   It's got forms, it's got forums,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   it's got photo galleries, integration with Flickr,
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.520]   and Twitter and all of that stuff.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   Just really, just a fantastic technology,
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.200]   a fantastic platform, and their server technology
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.080]   is rock solid.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.680]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.200]   We've tried.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.120]   squarespace.com/twig, try it free for two weeks.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.640]   No credit card needed if you decide to buy,
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.880]   do use that offer code Twig,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.400]   so you get 10% off for the life of your site.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.920]   The secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.280]   So I don't know, is this good or not, Gina?
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   The Apache Foundation says it's taking over Wave.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.440]   - I think it's very good.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.920]   It's the first time that I felt really, really
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.680]   super optimistic about Wave in a box.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.120]   So, novel and a couple of other countries,
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.520]   companies who have been working on the Google Wave code
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.320]   have submitted a proposal to the Apache Software Foundation.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.120]   I'm not exactly sure how this process works,
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.000]   but from what I understand, they submitted a proposal.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.200]   So, the ASF hasn't necessarily taken it on yet,
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.640]   although correct me if I'm wrong on that, Leo.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.360]   But basically to make the Wave in a box
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.960]   into an Apache project, it would be Apache Wave.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.880]   So Apache would release a Wave server product,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.960]   which is great news, because almost all of the internet
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.880]   is run by the Apache web server, HTTP server.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.840]   So it kind of gives it kind of new life.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.720]   And I've actually been beta testing out Novel Vibe,
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.280]   which is a Wave based collaboration platform
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.120]   and it's interesting.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.560]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.520]   - That's a smart direction.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.480]   So it's doing both in a way.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   It's doing a commercial version
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.360]   and then it's gonna support an ASF version, we hope.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.360]   - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Wave is definitely
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.880]   gonna live on a different kind of incarnations
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.800]   for different places, in different places,
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   open source and also commercial products.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.080]   So I'm not gonna be using this one of us.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.240]   - It should have been, rather than being touted
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.560]   as a world-changing product, it's a new engine,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.040]   Wave inside, isn't it?
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.280]   - I think it was the intent all along,
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.960]   because Wave in a Box was right part of the beginning, wasn't it?
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.520]   - Well, I mean, Wave was always open source.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.080]   The idea that it was one of the founding principles
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.840]   of Wave was that it would be federated
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.800]   and that lots of different people would run servers.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.720]   So this was kind of part of the initial idea.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.600]   I think that when Google dropped support for it
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.360]   and said, "Hey, we're not gonna actively develop this anymore,"
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.600]   it just felt like, well, total lack of confidence from Google,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.840]   it felt like it wasn't gonna go anywhere.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.560]   But now this is, I think, is really gonna give it new life
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.120]   and maybe a better home.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.960]   So I'm excited about it, right?
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.000]   - This is very exciting.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.240]   So keep that book alive.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   - Yeah.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.840]   - I'll put it back in your lower third
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.600]   and your links on the show notes.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.360]   - Although I'm gonna have the Android book problem,
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.640]   which is that I'm gonna have all sorts
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.760]   of Wave implementations to cover in the book.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.560]   So me and Kevin will be up writing different chapters
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.280]   for different versions.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.720]   - Here's an interesting shift in the Android marketplace.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.880]   Ratings, content ratings,
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.840]   and Google's saying you're gonna be labeled mature
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.840]   if you don't get your rating starting next week.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.280]   I think this is good.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.400]   Everybody's complaining.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.440]   There are a few pain points with Android.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.040]   One is the proliferation of platforms.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.520]   The other people complain about it all the time.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.360]   I don't find it a problem,
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.960]   but people complain about the market all the time.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.240]   And I think the market's fine 'cause you can get refunds.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.720]   That's a real advantage over Apple.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.120]   I guess content ratings might make it easier.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.840]   Mostly people complain because there's too much garbage,
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.760]   I guess, in the marketplace.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.400]   And I don't think that's gonna go away.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.720]   - Right.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.000]   I think any way to rate, curate,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.720]   help the good stuff bubble to the top.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.920]   Android market is a good thing
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.400]   'cause that seems to be the biggest complaint with it.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.240]   Although I agree with you.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.560]   I haven't had much trouble with the market.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.080]   I mean, I don't just stall with Leo installed
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.480]   and listen to my friends.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.200]   - We use App Brain.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.040]   We watch when our friends install.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.880]   - Right.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.720]   I think we're really close to it.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.960]   Maybe for a casual user finding the really good stuff
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.080]   Android market is a little harder.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.440]   - Here's the model I think should work.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.480]   And I think we talked about this before.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.520]   You and the three of you should have a curated level
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.720]   on top of the marketplace.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.920]   And every time I buy an app through you,
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.640]   through you, you should go to Spiff.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.160]   - A little bonus, yeah.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.360]   I don't wanna do that because I couldn't do that
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.640]   'cause it's a.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.720]   - Well, just theoretically.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.560]   - Yeah.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   - And a capitalistic world leaving behind your socialist roots.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.640]   - I couldn't do anything for profit.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.920]   That would be wrong.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.720]   - But I think that we need a curatorial layer on top.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.440]   I was back at this thing I'm doing
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.360]   trying to rethink the postal service this week,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.760]   which is so much fun.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   And the whole idea of a catalog and a channel,
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.440]   it's that set closed curatorial layer
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.240]   as opposed to a value added curatorial layer
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.600]   that I think that the marketplace needs,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.160]   like TV needs and like stores need and so on.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.360]   - Ratings aren't quite that.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.400]   In fact, the ratings are from the developers.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.800]   There'll be four content rating levels,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.460]   all preteen, teen and mature.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.600]   Developers submitting newer updated applications
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.720]   will be required to include a rating.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.000]   I don't know who's gonna review that.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.520]   A Python script probably.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.680]   The .py, I'm rated .py.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.520]   - Well, you know, it'll help people find porn.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.680]   You know, you just look for the app.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.280]   - Well, I think that's what this is a response to
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.120]   is the opposite.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.240]   Steve Jobs said you want porn use Android,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.560]   which probably sold a lot of phones by the way.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.280]   Steve, this might want to think about that next time.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.840]   - Why is there so much hate for Apple in this crew?
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   - I don't hate Apple.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.920]   - The show is called Twit.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.840]   Sorry Twig.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.520]   - I don't hate Apple.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.360]   - Okay.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.560]   - It's not about devices.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.920]   - It's not about devices.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.080]   - I don't use an iPhone just 'cause it's a crappy phone.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.040]   Of course, I just said I don't need a phone, didn't I?
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.040]   I use an iPad.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.880]   I like an iPad.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.120]   - Yeah, I'm on a MacBook right now.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.960]   - Yeah, look at--
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.800]   - Yeah.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.560]   - Jeff has a iPhone, iPhone 4.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.280]   We're all on Macs using Macs.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.760]   - All right, just wanna make sure.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.920]   - I think we're agnostic.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   I think this, I think, oh, you're falling prey
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.720]   to that thing that if you don't love Apple, you hate it.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.800]   - Yeah, I am bored.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   - I am not falling prey to any of that.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.640]   I'm happy using my blackberry.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   I switched away from iPhone--
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   - I do hate the blackberry.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.600]   - I'm on before all of you guys do.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.400]   I saw it all coming.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.200]   A minute they said we are with AT&T.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.800]   I said, oh, there you go.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.600]   - You knew there was a problem.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   - Oh, there was a problem.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.680]   And they won't acknowledge it.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.520]   - No, they won't.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   - Like the first thing--
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.720]   - Now you're the Apple Hater.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.200]   Now, see?
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.560]   - Oh, I'm not the Apple Hater.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.840]   I love Apple and I love Android.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.200]   I just love everything.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.040]   - Oh yeah.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:04.960]   - It's just 'til I don't.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.920]   - No, I think that this,
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.960]   I think we often get accused of being--
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.800]   - Apple Hater.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.760]   - Yeah, on the Apple show, I get accused of all of this stuff.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.240]   And I think the point is not to love or hate anything.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.320]   It's just technology.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.160]   Come on.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.200]   I mean, it's just stuff.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.040]   You don't have to--
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.520]   - People treat it all like a sports team.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.880]   - Oh, it's, you know, if you're not on the Apple team,
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.040]   you must be a Google team member.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.800]   - It's not a team sport.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.520]   - But you know that it has happened though.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.720]   If you really look at it,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:40.560]   it just is the discourse has devolved into that like--
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.400]   - Oh, totally.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.800]   - Either are a situation right now.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.440]   And I didn't know why that is.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.640]   - You know, so I think we're fair.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.760]   I think we try it very hard.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.800]   Everybody here tries very hard to be fair.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.640]   - We try to be.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.360]   There's definitely Google and Apple kind of represent
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.040]   these kind of two different cultures or tribes.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.680]   I mean, just like values-wise, openness versus,
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.800]   and very generally speaking, but it's all technology.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.640]   And both, you know, I think both companies
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.720]   make credible technology that we definitely--
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.120]   - Oh, we're a little hard on jobs sometimes, I would say.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.240]   - We were very, very, very hard on Facebook
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.440]   and then have come back around and are, you know,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.640]   ready for the group hug.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.200]   - Well, I wouldn't go that far.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.120]   (laughing)
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.040]   - No, sweaty zakogs.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.880]   - Sweaty zakogs, ooh!
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.440]   Hey, you gotta love this Jeff Jarvis.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.200]   They're throwing eggs at houses
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.440]   that are blurred in Google Street View.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.280]   You're the guy-- - In Germany.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.480]   - You're the guy who called it Blurmany.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.320]   - Well, somebody else, I always take credit for that.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.040]   I can't, but I help spread it.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.240]   - Danny Sullivan writing in search engine land says,
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.440]   "People, Deutsche Vetta reported
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.440]   "the people are egging homes in Essen that were blurred."
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.960]   - If you throw an egg at pixels, doesn't splat.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.240]   (laughing)
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.080]   It's kind of amazing that they would go to this much effort.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.760]   - Well, the whole thing has just gotten so wonderfully--
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.160]   - Talk about a team support.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.240]   Yeah, you're either, you know, you're either a Google fan
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.680]   or a Google enemy apparently.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.600]   - Well, and people, now neighbors are getting mad
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.760]   at each other 'cause they're, you know,
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.440]   I don't want my home pixelated.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.760]   Well, I do, Google's Munich headquarters,
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.400]   not for the whole country, but for Munich were pixelated.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.240]   - What?
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.400]   - 'Cause some tenant in the building wanted its own.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.640]   There was also another site,
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.680]   oh, God, I don't have the URL right now,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.040]   that is having people go in and identify the addresses
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.400]   of all the pixelated homes.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.240]   - Well, that's how they're egging.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.360]   - They're still off by 11,000, exactly.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.840]   And so there's now a, there's more attention
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.640]   to those addresses than to just,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.680]   everybody else's address 'cause there's now a directory
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.160]   of them, a guy named Jens Best did this.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   If you search for him, you'll probably find it.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.800]   And then if you go to Google in a lot of places,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.760]   you'll see over the pixelization,
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   as you can do with any photo anywhere,
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.000]   but now there are little photos there
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.600]   and you can mouse over and you see the buildings.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.920]   So it's a whole bunch of huha for nothing.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.200]   I'm gonna get myself in trouble here,
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   I think Olm is gonna come after me,
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.680]   but I think that there's some strange similarity
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.560]   that goes back to my argument about Germans
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.040]   and their private parts,
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.280]   which is that it's always about the private parts, isn't it?
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.120]   - Yep.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.280]   - But the same kind of,
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.320]   I'll try to come with a less loaded word than hysteria,
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.600]   that we see over the TSA this weekend,
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.120]   we see in Germany over,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.880]   - Do you think the TSA thinks hysteria?
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.360]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.440]   - I guess I haven't gone through it.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.680]   I don't, I don't--
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.200]   - I tweeted a whole lot and pissed them off like crazy,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.240]   the crew, but I've created a whole bunch.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.400]   There's absolutely no protest at the airports.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.000]   Everything's going really smoothly.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.640]   - It's an asopt-out day.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.080]   - And nothing happened.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.000]   But there's this idea that,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.360]   oh my God, no one can get within n inches of my private parts,
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.400]   that's the American thing.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.720]   And the German thing is,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.320]   no one can show my building where I live.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.920]   And in both cases, it's an emotional reaction, I argue.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.560]   - It's just a bizarre thing to say,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.720]   oh, don't show my house.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.680]   - And they're saying,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.600]   well, we think it's bizarre that they go to Asana
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.800]   and show their private parts.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.440]   We hear it that gets the highest possible violation
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.560]   you could imagine.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.520]   - Why am I showing them?
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.400]   I don't want somebody to jiggle them.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.320]   (laughing)
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.800]   - Okay, well, for that line there.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.060]   (laughing)
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:15.280]   - I'll show them if you don't jiggle them.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.960]   - I think that could be the name of the song.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.440]   - Let me show you.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.360]   I just wanna do it, that's all.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.120]   - They only, did you ever do a show?
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.440]   Like just wear an underwear below the desk?
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:33.080]   - Oh yeah, in fact, just the show before this one,
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.360]   we were doing security now.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.440]   I saw this, nobody saw it,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.560]   'cause I went into a commercial
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.960]   and I saw two monitors and I saw Steve get up.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.720]   He's wearing shorts.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.040]   He's got a nice button down shirt,
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.160]   but you guys up, it's whoa, party time down there.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.040]   But I think that it is a little bit of a Hobson's choice.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.720]   You've got an X-ray that we don't really know how dangerous
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.000]   it is, it sounds like it's not, which is good news.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.240]   Or you get a very intimate groping.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.960]   It seems like that's not such a great,
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.240]   all just 'cause I wanna go home for Thanksgiving.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.400]   I don't know if that's hysteria.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.960]   Especially since it doesn't seem,
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.400]   I don't think that you can make a case
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.680]   that it improves security in any way.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.160]   - Well, but then you're trying to prove a negative.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.680]   You're trying to say, which is of course impossible,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.600]   that, and it's impossible both ways.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.840]   Without this we'll never know
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.240]   whether it improves, it will never know well.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.440]   - Well, I think we know it doesn't improve it
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.120]   because there's a great video of Adam Savage
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.760]   with Mythbusters talking about going through TSA back
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.880]   and forth, back and forth.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.520]   And he showed what he had, he forgot,
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.560]   he had this, these are razors, this long.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.240]   He had two of them and then they never stopped him.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.880]   - There were there were fans.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.840]   - Yeah, maybe, oh it's Adam,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.040]   he's just carrying razors around.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.760]   - Oh, by the way, somebody on Twitter tells me
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:51.040]   that the site in Germany is finda.pixel,
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:55.280]   F-I-N-D-E-D-A-S-P-I-X-E-L dot D-E.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.560]   - F-I-N-D-E dot.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.840]   - F-I-N-D-E-D-A-S-P-I-X-E-L,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.960]   finda.pixel dot D-E.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.600]   And Jens Best of the Sense, really quite hilarious
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.400]   'cause they've gotten, let's see how many they have now.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.960]   19,000 buildings identified.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.200]   - I was surprised, there's almost a quarter of a million
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.000]   people have opted out.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.560]   Yeah, they played out, it's less than 3%.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.520]   But still I thought there was a large number too.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.960]   - This is a significant number.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.240]   - So what does gefunden mean?
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.080]   - Defined.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.640]   - Okay, so I'm gonna press gefunden.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.200]   I guess it'll find some--
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.560]   - That means you found one.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.720]   - Oh, I see.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.000]   So you add it to the database.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.560]   - On the bottom of it, if you go to those presses there
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560]   and just click on those.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.520]   - Ah, so I'm not all, some of them are, oh yeah, no.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.720]   - Oh yeah, no, there's, there's,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.400]   just click on those addresses and you see this,
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:50.400]   this hilarious, I would say, desecration.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.920]   - Oh yeah, there's one, yeah.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.920]   There's one, it's just silly.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.360]   It's like, you mean you don't know what that is?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.840]   If I were standing there, I would know what,
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.620]   I mean, what has that done?
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.400]   It's really cool, cool.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.360]   - Well, you got a sense of what your neighbor is like.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.960]   - Yeah, you just roll of houses,
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   they're all exactly the same.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.800]   - That's really funny.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.640]   - That's funny.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   - This one, it's a giant.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.360]   It's very funny looking.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.800]   - It's kind of pointless.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.600]   (laughing)
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   - I don't know who does it.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.960]   I mean, it looks like the Google employee
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.920]   is doing this is kind of disgruntled anyway.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.240]   It's like, (groaning)
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   I should mush you out, I'll take care of you.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.480]   (groaning)
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.720]   - Wasn't there also a staged birth
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.480]   on the streets of Berlin that was captured by us?
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.680]   - Yeah, it's so hilarious.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.720]   - Well, I like Jeff's idea where they publish
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.400]   where they're going so that everybody can put on a play.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.240]   - Yeah.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.600]   - Like, act out all sorts of drama on the streets.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.360]   - That's what people thought had happened almost.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.840]   There was a birth there and it was staged.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.760]   My theory is it's the in front of an advertising agency.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.800]   And so I'm guessing it was a clever trick for that.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.360]   But I think it's on the list, Leo, you can show it
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.040]   where you see a baby being pulled out.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   I think it's there.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.080]   - Ooh, that they should blur.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.720]   Blur that up.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.600]   - Thank you.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.040]   - If you looked down the list, I think I said not true.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.760]   And there you got it.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.840]   - Yeah, is it performance art a real birth?
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.080]   - Yeah, click on the Gizmodo link.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.520]   Gizmodo has the full image.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.000]   You know, it's just too good an image.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.080]   Like, I don't know.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.640]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.920]   - What about the naked guy in the boot of a car?
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.760]   What was that all about?
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.560]   - That one I can't figure out.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.400]   - Oh, those drugs?
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.560]   - That's staged because there's like a broken umbrella.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.400]   There's this and that.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.600]   I mean, it looks like a murder mystery.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.920]   - Yeah, this is definitely people playing around.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.040]   - All right, so it says,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.840]   "Click on the shot above to see the baby in its full, fresh..."
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.120]   Oh, I don't think this is fake.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:46.960]   She was trying.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.760]   - Because Google confirms it's fake.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.240]   It's not really the address.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.960]   It was shot as if.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.520]   And then sent out there.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.160]   - Yeah, that kinda looks like, yeah.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.480]   - That's just too perfect a shot.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.400]   You can see everything.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.680]   I mean, you know, you can see the baby, the...
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   - I like the guy on the phone.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.840]   - I love the guy doing the pointing.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.800]   - Guy on the phone pointing.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.440]   Quick, get an ambulance.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.740]   We've got a baby.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.960]   - They pixelated the license plate,
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.360]   which is a nice touch.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.920]   - Apparently there's a hospital right across the street.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.160]   - Oh, well that guy's type can't take some of the...
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.160]   Yeah, all right, there you go.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.440]   You just, yeah, all right, now I believe it's fake.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440]   - But that was spreadin' around.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.760]   - It's a record, that was free first.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.160]   - Right, right.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.920]   - You do see how false...
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.360]   I was whacking that mole a couple times
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.000]   and people I know were saying, "Look at this."
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.840]   - We'll get this in our email 10 years from now.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.680]   - Yeah.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.520]   - Did you see?
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.520]   Thank God for Snopes.com.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.240]   All right, we got a couple more stories
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.680]   and we're gonna get our pics of the week two
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.640]   and our tip and their number and all of that stuff
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.440]   before we go any further though,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.560]   I'd like to mention our friends at Citrix
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.400]   who do a great product that will save you a lot of time
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.840]   and money traveling and it will make your conference calls
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.720]   much more engaging, we're talking about,
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.640]   go to meeting, go to meeting.com/tweig

[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.320]   there's something to look at, I love, go to meeting.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.200]   We use it to all the time, there's a great iPad app.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.600]   I don't think they have an Android app yet,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.880]   sure that would be a great thing to have.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.080]   Everybody on the call is more focused, more interested,
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.160]   they're frankly, they're more engaged.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.920]   So you'll save time, you'll be more productive,
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.520]   it's a great way to turn a conference call
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.080]   into something that really, really memorable.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.480]   For great, for product demos, for sales presentations,
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.840]   for collaboration, for training,

[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.240]   Go to meeting.com/tweig, we thank them for their support
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   and for the support of this week.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   In Google, Diaspora goes live, anybody get an invitation
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.000]   to Diaspora, I haven't seen it, I tried.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.120]   - I haven't, I think they're gonna invite folks who
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.080]   don't need it, and you get money, right Leo?
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.640]   So you probably, yeah, you'll probably get an invite to.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.800]   - It's supposed to get a T-shirt or something.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:10.640]   Facebook's trying to own the trademark for the word face.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.720]   Does that seem right?
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   (sighs)
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.680]   (laughing)
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.720]   - Nothing more to say.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.560]   - Yep.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   - Nothing more to say.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.120]   Did you like the Google, I really liked the Google
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.160]   doodle for Thanksgiving, is it still up?
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.360]   I have to try.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.480]   - It is, it is still up.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.520]   So for people like me who will be saying tomorrow morning,
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.320]   how the hell do I make this turkey?
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.160]   (laughing)
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.160]   You can go to Google.com.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.800]   - And there's six recipes from.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.000]   - Ina Garten.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.400]   - Ina Garten, yeah, who's a barefoot,
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.240]   barefoot, Contessa, right?
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.280]   - Oh, that's the barefoot, Contessa, oh, that's neat.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.000]   - Yeah, and there's a few recipes there.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.480]   - Oh, that's really, that's a little different for Google.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.120]   Usually you click the doodle and you get a search result.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.000]   - Yeah, you get a search result or a special landing page.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.760]   Yeah, this is kind of, it's interesting.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   It's real kind of special content.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.120]   - Do I get a different, I'm only,
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.880]   do I get a different recipe if I refresh?
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.440]   - You can click on the, on the thumbnails on the left there.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.360]   I see the different. - Oh, I see, I see.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.080]   Russell's sprouts, no!
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.160]   - Oh, Brussels sprouts are good if they're made right.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.040]   - Oh, I hate them, I hate them.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.200]   - Oh, you know what, you know what,
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   just put a little bacon in there.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   - Yeah, a little bacon, I'll make Brussels sprouts really good.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.520]   - So you fry up some bacon,
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.720]   you saute the Brussels sprouts and the bacon.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.560]   - What's that makes anything good?
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.960]   - And then you throw the Brussels sprouts out
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.240]   and eat the bacon, it's great.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.440]   No, I like Brussels sprouts.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.520]   I just feel like anything that tastes like that
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.720]   has got to be good for you.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.840]   - Yeah, it's true, it is very satisfying.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.680]   - That's why I think it.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.680]   - You feel yourself right, just unhealthy.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.880]   And then you eat the mashed potatoes
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.040]   and gravy without guilt.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.480]   - That's what I'm thinking.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.360]   And then there are mobile apps for the Thanksgiving host.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.040]   (laughs)
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.320]   - So next, when you go to the Thanksgiving,
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.240]   bring along a mobile app.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.080]   - Yeah, they've got these checklists
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.240]   to make sure you've got everything done, recipe apps,
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.040]   there's a few different drink mixers
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.480]   for when Uncle Bert and Aunt Marge get kind of unbearable,
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.280]   you know, you get kind of give them martini.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.120]   There's a few mobile apps linked there on the app.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.800]   - This is great, this is a gizmodo page, mixologist.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.660]   The one they like the best is called chow.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.080]   - Yeah, food.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:14.920]   - This is good.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.080]   - It has a Thanksgiving dinner coach.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.080]   - This is good, and these are all Apple apps.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.920]   Looks like--
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.080]   - Another Apple and the Android--
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.200]   - Oh, there's an Android, there's an Android.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.320]   Thanksgiving planner, yes see this is,
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.440]   okay, Apple chow, pictures of turkeys,
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   gorgeous graphics, Android checklist, things to remember.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.560]   - And QR codes.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.120]   - And QR codes, that's it right there in a nutshell.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.320]   Android versus Apple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.120]   (laughing)
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.800]   - Come on, there's one Android out there,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.400]   with some good pictures of roasting turkeys.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.680]   - And Blackberry?
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.760]   - Nothing. - Nothing.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.200]   - What is Thanksgiving?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   We do not know, we're Canadians.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   - Oh, it's Canadian, that's right.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.720]   - We celebrated last month,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.520]   what are you talking about, Thanksgiving?
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.040]   - Blackberry does two things, it makes phone calls,
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.960]   and it gets email, which some things you can't do,
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.480]   very well on any of your devices.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   - But Blackberry, email, email.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.320]   - Email, email, email, email, email.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.960]   - Killing email, there is no email anymore.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.520]   - Yeah, what's this email that you talk of, which you talk?
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:21.240]   - Yeah, yeah, I've seen a bridge on sale in Brooklyn,
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.720]   since I'm using mail, okay.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.200]   - Email's dead, don't you know that?
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.960]   - This is a you're bridging Brooklyn.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.440]   (laughing)
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.840]   - I love them, I have to help them all.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.480]   - You must have heard that once or twice,
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.320]   you lived in Brooklyn.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.040]   - Yeah, I read the her all times.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.200]   So, let's get our tip of the week, Miss Gina Trapani.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.280]   - Tip of the week, this one I love,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   there's a Google Voice tip.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.040]   You can record calls in Google Voice,
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.280]   you have to press four when you're actually on the call.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   Not a lot of people know about this.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.720]   - No, I didn't know it for years.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.760]   - Yeah, I mean, it's incoming calls only,
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.800]   and a recording breaks in, and lots of other party know
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.840]   that it's being recorded.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.880]   - I hate that part, I was saying let me stealthily do it.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   - Well, it would be nice if it was stealth, right?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.160]   Well, a lot of people don't know that you can do that,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.960]   but now in the Gmail interface,
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960]   so you can receive calls, Google Voice calls,
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.120]   through Gmail, there is a record button,
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.840]   a little red record button,
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.360]   kind of like Scapes Paul recorder.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.680]   So, you can click that, and you can record calls,
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.760]   and it gets recorded to your Google Voice inbox,
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.000]   which is really handy if you're talking to your accountant,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.880]   or doing an interview, but it's only for incoming calls,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.760]   and it works the same way as when you press TAP4.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.600]   I think it's just gonna expose this feature
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.160]   that a lot of people didn't know about.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.040]   So, the little record button is kind of rolling out slowly,
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.160]   so next time you--
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.000]   - What would that be, incoming only?
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.120]   - You know, it's a good question,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.040]   'cause it doesn't make sense, right?
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.520]   I mean, you really would want it either way.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.960]   I'm not sure why it is--
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.600]   - When I interview people, you know,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.960]   I wanna record the call, so I use Skype,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.760]   and call recorder for that, which works really pretty well.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.000]   - Which works great, yeah.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.840]   - Yeah, there's no technical,
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.480]   I can't think of a technical reason for that.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.680]   - Can't think of a technical reason either,
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.040]   maybe it's just about, yeah, it doesn't make sense,
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.720]   the consent, you can get it either way,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.440]   it doesn't matter if the call's incoming or outgoing.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.160]   - I am recording this call!
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.080]   - Do you record stuff on a record calls on voice often, Leo?
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.920]   I haven't used it.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.800]   I'm frequently on interviews where they use it,
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.600]   which is smart, I mean, if you're a journalist,
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.960]   it's a great feature, actually.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.800]   - Oh, yeah, wonderful.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.440]   Our students learned that early in.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.360]   - Right away, yeah.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360]   - Our number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.960]   - Let's see here, let's see.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.200]   - I haven't right here.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.040]   - Here it is.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.040]   - Google, so for what it matters,
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.880]   Palin is winning the numbers in Google searches.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.320]   - That makes you happier, Seth, up to you,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.120]   but she's generating 16 times more queries
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.440]   than Mitt Romney, 14 times more than Newt Gingrich,
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.360]   38 times more than Mike Huckabee,
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.800]   and 87 times more than Tim Palenty.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.200]   - Huh.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.080]   - So I'm just-- - I wonder what needs
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.240]   Silver would have to say about this.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.840]   - Of 538.com.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.720]   - Yeah.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.080]   - Does more searches mean anything?
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.520]   - Yeah, it doesn't mean anything, exactly.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.360]   - That's why I don't know.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.680]   Well, but it, Facebook, remember we had this
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   as a number of about three weeks ago,
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.240]   after the midterms, that there was some correlation
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.800]   between Facebook friends and--
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.640]   - Oh, that's right, there was a very direct correlation,
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.480]   actually.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.320]   - Yeah, there was, yeah.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.840]   - But you could come up with many theories behind that,
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.720]   you know, the younger,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.480]   Hippor candidate in an anti-encomment world or whatever.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.320]   I don't know.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.400]   - Is there a way you can, Gina,
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.840]   like some programmatic way that we can do this,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.760]   that find out, you know, compare searches?
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.000]   Just Google reveal that?
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.840]   - Well, they do this, I guess, right?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.680]   - Yeah.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.120]   - I'm not sure if they reveal, like, I mean,
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.960]   it would, after I say, that was time.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.800]   - Well, you can't, 'cause you could try to buy
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.920]   the keyword of Sarah Palin.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.040]   - Oh, okay.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:41.880]   - Yeah, that's how you get to the level.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.920]   - I'm just curious, like, if Sarah Palin's legs
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.560]   gets more searches than Sarah Palin for president,
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.080]   or, you know, I mean, just curious what,
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.480]   how we parse that down.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.000]   - Where's your mind, Leo?
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.360]   - Well, it's got nice legs, but it's not the,
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.120]   you know, I'm just saying that that might be,
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.280]   you know, it might tell you something.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.200]   Like, all we know is that there are searches,
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200]   we don't know what they're searching for,
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.600]   maybe they're just trying to find the Discovery TV show.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.360]   - Right, well, that's a good point.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.880]   - Just got a TV show on.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.400]   Maybe that's a lot of people with Google TVs trying to--
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.080]   - It could be, well, and Palin itself
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.960]   had a lot of searches because of her daughter.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.320]   - Bristol was on the--
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.480]   - Right, and Pride is on Dancing with the Stars
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   and the Book.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.800]   - This is absolutely me and this number of the week,
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.960]   but I have to have one.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.840]   - I love that number, that's all right.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.680]   I'm not--
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.440]   - Somebody suggested a while ago that I should do instead
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.800]   of picking a pan of the week or something, I don't know.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.640]   - You can do anything you want.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.360]   You don't have to even ask me or tell me at a time,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.480]   just do it.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.560]   - Cheer and cheer.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.080]   - Cheers and cheers.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.560]   - Cheers and cheers.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.480]   - Cheers and--
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.080]   - I always love this fake, like, you know,
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.360]   brick bats and bouquets.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.560]   - Wired tired.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.880]   - Wired tired.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.440]   - Yeah, never mind, what a close shot.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.440]   (laughing)
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.440]   - Sorry, don't be close to you.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.600]   - We'll do a close shot in a week.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.920]   - Wired and Googled.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.960]   I was gonna do pick, please, have I done pick, please?
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.400]   Is my pick of the week? I think I have,
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.640]   but I wanna mention it again.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.800]   We talk a lot about Instagram on all of our shows,
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.880]   it's a really great Apple iPhone app
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.280]   that encourages you to take pictures
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.800]   and there's a social aspect you can like and comment.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.840]   And it's frankly about the only reason
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.760]   I ever use my iPhone anymore is 'cause I wanna take pictures
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.280]   with Instagram and share them with my friends.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.120]   There is actually a really good version of this
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.000]   for Android called Pick, Please,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.960]   and I think it's very interesting,
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.920]   they seem to be in a feature war.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.120]   P-I-C-P-L-Z, it's a free Android application.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.040]   And in some ways, Pick, Please has an advantage.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.000]   For instance, it has actually, has a web interface.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.560]   So you can browse through people's pictures.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.880]   There, all the liking and following and commenting
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   of Instagram is the same.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.960]   There is an interesting fee where, just like Instagram,
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.880]   and I think this is something new
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.120]   that the Pick, Please, people added
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.680]   because of Instagram.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.280]   They have the filters that Instagram has.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.760]   I wouldn't say as good, but people are using them to,
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   you know, to some advantage.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.120]   I'd like to see more people use it
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.320]   'cause it's kind of fun.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.160]   P-I-C-P-L-Z, I'm Leo Laporta,
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.600]   I'm Pick, Please, if you wanna follow me.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.680]   And if you have an Android phone
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.560]   and you'd like to kind of take part in this social photography,
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.880]   it's the return of mobile logging everybody.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.480]   It's back.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.980]   - Hi. - Yay.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:25.960]   And a lot of people's lunches, mostly.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.120]   (laughing)
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.880]   - Well, I wanna go back to what Om said earlier.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.920]   - Right, he's really right,
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.000]   that we're just kind of limping along,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.120]   still using old forms and old assumptions.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.440]   Oh, in this case, it's only five to 10 years old.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.280]   - Right.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.240]   - But there is a need for something to break out.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.240]   - Well, what do we do?
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.160]   Let's have a manifesto.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.840]   What's the Om Manifesto?
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.320]   - Geez, why are you asking me these tough questions?
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.480]   - You started it.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.880]   - You started it. - You get to make up,
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.040]   you mean, if Jeff gets to make up numbers,
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.960]   you get to say, press for record calls.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.600]   I gotta come up with something smart.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.440]   - Yeah.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.920]   - I'm not coming back on your show ever.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.800]   - Okay, nevermind, I said it.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.280]   - I have no idea how to fix this thing if I did,
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.160]   I would have written about that.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.040]   - You would be a lousy blogger,
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.800]   you'd be out there with a startup.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.640]   - Yeah, I think kick a Om is a startup, isn't it?
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.040]   - I know, but it's been around five years,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.680]   so you don't think like that.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.240]   But I do have a tip for you.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.600]   - Oh, I'd love to hear it.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.000]   - Yeah, there is an app for Android called Remote Camera,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.400]   which is like Hymstomatic and Instagram,
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.040]   and it's a lot of fun.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.240]   - Oh, I have to try it, Remote Camera?
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.200]   - Yeah. - All right, good.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.120]   - You, is it Remote Camera?
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.200]   Or something of that, sorry, hang on.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.880]   It just calls Remote Camera, yeah.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.320]   - R-E-M-O-T-E-C-A-M-E-R-A.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.200]   - And it basically is a Hymstomatic flow, I think.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.600]   - I love Hymstomatic, that's a really great iPhone app,
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.000]   that gives you all the different kind,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.160]   like the Lomo and Polaroid
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.000]   and all the different looks.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.920]   - Yeah, I like FX camera for that,
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.560]   but I always like an app that'll give me good effects.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.320]   - Well, as long as we're talking camera apps,
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.720]   how about Vignette, have you played with that
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.800]   a little bit on Android?
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.560]   That's actually my favorite on Android.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.320]   It allows you to do a lot of different effects,
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.960]   borders, it's actually very, very capable of Vignette.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.680]   You can do effects, frames, of all different kinds.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.960]   If you wanna play with that,
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.400]   that's another free tip.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.840]   - Oh, Malek, is it gigaohm.com, that's where he blogs.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.880]   And it was great having you on, thank you, Om,
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.760]   really appreciate it.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.720]   - Well, thank you for inviting me to the show.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.280]   - You're so great, come back soon.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   - Hey, I think I might have given you the wrong name,
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.560]   it's called FX camera.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.400]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.240]   - FX camera.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.680]   - I have seen that, FX camera.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.600]   - I don't know why I was saying Remote Camera.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.640]   - No, no, FX camera, yeah.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.680]   - Yeah, that's the one that I use,
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.960]   but I'm gonna have to check out the--
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.560]   - FX, Vignette.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.200]   - Yeah, FX camera, Android application by YMST,
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.560]   YMST, if you wanna, there's the white effect,
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.640]   isn't that beautiful?
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.480]   (laughing)
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.080]   It's like a polar bear in a snowstorm.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.600]   Oh, there it is, here it comes.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.000]   FX camera.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.360]   - Cool.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.200]   All right.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.000]   - Thank you, thank you, Om.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.640]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.440]   And the awesome-- - We look like you can use this.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.360]   - Yeah, you look like Gina, yeah.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.880]   The author of this fabulous book, What Would Gina Do?
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.080]   I mean, what would Google do?
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.640]   (laughing)
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.520]   - It's all about the G.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.720]   - It's all about the G, baby.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.080]   All about the G.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.360]   And we're glad to have you once again, Jeff.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.680]   Have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.600]   - Thank you, you too.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.200]   - Gina Trapani@buzzmachine.com.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.800]   And the author of the newly revised Complete Guide
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.600]   to Google Wave.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.840]   Oh, there she is.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.680]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.520]   - It's a little like.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.360]   - Yep, there's the proof.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.200]   - I confuse you.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.040]   - Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.080]   Don't have too much gravy.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.000]   - Did you get your, your glee songs?
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.560]   - Oh, not yet, not yet.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.280]   I'm gonna run down the mailbox, check them, check for it today.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.280]   - Check them out, that's a good stuff.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.120]   Yeah, I'm good.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.280]   - Very excited.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.440]   - I'm sorry, but that Carol Burnett episode, not good.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.880]   - Yeah, not so much with the,
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.720]   well, we'll give them another shot.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.960]   - If they go 20 minutes into the show
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.040]   and they're having, and they haven't burst into song.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.360]   - Yeah, yeah, now I know, I know.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.240]   - I wanna see it.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.080]   - I'm with you.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.000]   - For her, her, her plastic surgery was scary.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.200]   - Do you think that was really her singing?
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.520]   'Cause she's has this very, you know, gravely voice.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.640]   And then she bursts into song
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.480]   and she sounds fantastic.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.400]   I just can't believe that that was her singing.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.320]   - There's a lot of production that goes on.
