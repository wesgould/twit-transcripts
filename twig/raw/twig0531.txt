[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   Coming up, it's Twig, this week in Google. We've got Stacey, Jeff, and all joining me, Jason, how we're gonna talk.

[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.920]   Device and that would be of course the Nest Mini. Pixel 4, unfortunately, we don't have in-house
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:23.080]   But that didn't stop us from talking a lot about it. Also, we kind of say goodbye to phone-based virtual reality
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.400]   Talk a little bit about Elon Musk's tweets from space and how that's happening
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.560]   And dive into a little phone history with the Motorola Razr a whole lot more than just that next on this week in Google

[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.720]   Leo is pretending like he is not a podcaster instead. He's he's being a world traveler

[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   I was just saying right before the show I was gonna say it for the show. I love doing this show
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.600]   I an earlier today I was like cleaning up my house and like just thinking about how much I was looking forward to this show
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   So I'm super happy you're in a light boog
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   Yes, I'm in a dark mood. That's right. Even though I like dark mode on my phone. You're a light group
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.760]   Jeff Jarvis before having you here, sir. Thank you. Jeff. It's a lazy Leo off. You're not working
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.720]   You're here keeping the fort down. Yes. Yes. Yes, I think that's what you say. I'm happy to be here
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.840]   Jeff Jarvis Buzz machine.com always great to see you sir also joining us
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.280]   Stacy Higginbotham although I think that's the name of the other you what is the name of the person?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.360]   Stacy this is this is still Stacy. It's just Stacy with different hair. I feel like you're spires
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   It's Stacy Wigginbotham
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   You nailed it that seems so obvious
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   So obvious I love it Stacy Wigginbotham Stacy on IOT.com and to my left and Pruitt yes
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   I am
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.520]   No, it probably should though some of these days bright lights in here reflecting off of this chrome dome of mine
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   What kind of wig would you go for if you had your preference? Oh, it would definitely be a like a blonde afro
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.880]   With with hair and oh no chair
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.840]   That's me in 1974 that is an awesome photo. Wow
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.440]   That is indeed you but you almost
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.680]   Dark you almost look like Steve Jobs there - yeah
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   Look to you. That's not why since 1974 official Chicago Police Department press pass
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.480]   That's awesome, it's like being at the museum you guys
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.480]   I know
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   Today taking a step back in time through the history of journalism
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:32.200]   I might send you a wig be afraid of the wig that he sends you
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.640]   Yeah, I don't think because you'll have to wear it on the next episode
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   That's why no no it might be made of like NYC rat pellets or something and I'm not I'm not up for that
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.360]   Asens in light mode you Stacey are in dark mode
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.720]   Even though your even though your wig is very light
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.120]   So so I thought of you Jeff today because I had a migraine this morning and I was trying to do my show
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.600]   And I could not look at the screen. I was like why is there no dark mode for Google?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.400]   How's the migraine now? It's oh can't you I'm freaking happy man
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.680]   It's amazing when they end how how it really you just you just look
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.560]   Levitate about five feet, right?
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.080]   Exactly well, maybe only three, but you know, I'll go for it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.480]   too like I don't have regular migraines, but I've definitely had something of
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   Of the level of a migraine probably a couple of years ago
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.040]   Probably the only time I've ever had such a bad headache that like I wanted
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.560]   Everything to end I was just like so miserable. I was like this is what?
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.000]   People who have migraines is probably what they experience. It's brutal
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.680]   Yes, it is
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.000]   It makes you hate life. Yeah. Yeah, it really really does if if my experience was anything similar to what a true
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   My I used to have them, but they were I can see what away
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.320]   It's all that staring to computer screens that helped you as you get older Jeff. They age I know
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   Yeah
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.560]   All right, I'm gonna stop teasing Jeff about his his wisdom and experience in the world
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.920]   So I I was at the dirt well, you okay, so we're gonna do the old guy thing
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.240]   I have my clock call on Oscar be last Friday if you want to hear anything about it be happy to tell you there's new treatments better
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.040]   That would be no you young people. It's coming to you. Yes, I doubt it. Just watch out
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.400]   So so I was at the dermatologist this morning and you'll check on doing venture and it is kind of little white spots right here
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.480]   You know, I said what was that is the change? I went for a white place. Oh, yes. Those are wisdom spots. You get them with a
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.160]   Right a lot. Yeah, he was trying for a tip. Yeah
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   That's actually so that's when sun damage and when your skin stops producing melanin you get them
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.240]   So it is uh-huh. They're not a wisdom spots, but I mean no, they're wisdom. Thanks for bursting his bubble
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.360]   But if it makes you feel better, I have some just brought them all the way back to reality. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.000]   That's right. Welcome to reality
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.320]   Well, what next week I want you to bring a picture of you with hair
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.160]   Who me? Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. I can do that. I can do that
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.720]   Yeah, I want some old modeling pictures when I had hair
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.720]   Yeah, wait, wait, there's more in there. Yes. I feel like you just kind of breezed over this
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   That was a humble brag about
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   I did what?
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.600]   We're gonna get to Google in a second, but first. Yeah, what is this about modeling? Are you a model? Oh, yeah, I did
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.720]   Man, it's been 20 some my years now, but I did a little bit locally back home in Charlotte. All right
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   I've bought some what did you bottle?
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.280]   Most of the time it was just clothes and sometimes I did hand modeling and hand modeling
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.200]   But I tell it was clothes and just just being mean. Yeah, they needed a black face at the time
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   And I looked good enough on camera and it worked out. It was fun. I
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.040]   Adjust the face. They wanted the whole look the whole body. Yeah, they had that too
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:15.080]   Well these were these clothes you would have worn. Oh, you weren't paid to. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. It was a good fit
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:21.440]   It was a lot of fun. Good. I was I was a lot younger back then and I definitely want to see
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.120]   More more realizing what we do check in on next week about the cheesy catalog or like old school poses
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   Did you have any cheesy old school poses? I will have to look
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:42.680]   I'm thinking the like the knee up with your elbow on the first one
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.000]   Because my mind was on a campus was on a university campus and they had me like kneeling down just like we're
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.960]   Okay, yeah, and that's the first one comes in my mind. I think I still have that one somewhere
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.160]   Yeah, it was like that. It's so dorky, but it's but is it but is it Pruitt? So I look good. That's right
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.780]   Well, I think I think we need you to do model all the twitch swag. I can
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.400]   Plan I can do that. Yeah
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   Great idea
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.840]   All right, so we know what we're doing next week as for this week
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.440]   We might spend a whole episode on on your modeling career next week, but this week
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.580]   We got a whole lot of Google in this doc. Yes
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.240]   I thought when the doc looks like this do you want to start with products or do you want to start with news?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.440]   There's the the products are fun
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.840]   All right, I feel the products all right. I have a question. Oh, okay
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.800]   Okay, well, um, okay, how about this? I've got something right here. Oh
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.760]   You ready to live in the box
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.040]   Something is in the box and it's ready to be unboxed and I know you guys
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.720]   It's not a week it is go ahead and show the overhead
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.960]   Oh, it's it's a oh, I'm sorry
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.040]   It's an S mini I
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.400]   Really I was hoping to get the pixel for before showtime today. It didn't happen
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.240]   Oh, he's taking the cellophane, you know, but I did get the nest mini so we could start there
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.960]   It's not quite as entertaining or or or interesting
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.800]   But I do have it new in the box and there it is. It looks identical to what you probably already have
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.360]   Yeah
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.560]   But yeah, so the nest mini with the
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:38.000]   You could hang out with watch yeah, and I didn't realize this apparently some of the reviewers are that are have
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.840]   I played around with this are saying that it actually sounds better when it's mounted on your wall
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.120]   So Kevin said his review. Yeah, so now now I'm curious to see the direction of the speakers on that
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.760]   Yeah, like why that is different on the wall versus on the flat surface I
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.040]   Assume it's because it the walls most of our walls are hollow unless you've got like a pre-war kind of apartment
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   Right, so it's gonna help resonate
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:09.140]   Yeah, and I mean if you're on a table, which is the way it usually has been
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.800]   Well, I like that shot
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.280]   If it's on a table like there must be something to how the sound
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   projects out of the device off the reflective surface and out because if it's on a table
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.560]   It's more likely reflecting up versus out and if it's on a wall
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.080]   It's projecting out into the room maybe a little bit more. That's just a guess
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.200]   But I do also know that they've done some work on the speakers
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.720]   They've added more base response
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.000]   They're probably not gonna get a whole lot of base response out of this little hockey puck right here
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.400]   But when he tested it last time it did sound pretty good base wise
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.560]   Yeah, Kevin says he didn't know if it had to X the base, but he said it was really
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.400]   Okay
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.960]   Yeah, I feel like it's even got kind of like a tackiness here that I'm not used to I don't know but I mean by all
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.000]   Like by looking at it really does look just just like the wall man. This is so exciting
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.120]   I know see this is like I'm really happy that we led with the nest
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.800]   You guys should have seen
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.000]   Delivery came in today and the look on his face when he was he got the bot set it down and he opens it
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Oh, it's just a nest
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.400]   I was excited. I was like, oh great. He was loving when it works out like this like getting a guy's right before the show
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.680]   I'm like the pixel 4 like I know what we're talking about today and then I opened it and it was
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.960]   He was a hockey puck. Oh, man. He would just he was up here, and then he just immediately went there
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.680]   That's okay
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   I'll have to wait a little bit longer for the pixel 4 it's supposed to come sometime this week
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   But just in time for your next all about Android show. Yeah, yeah, sure
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.000]   And then next week's this week in Google will I'm pretty certain will definitely have it on on set then so we can talk about it then
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.360]   But I'm not having I'm not having pixel 4 envy. No
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   Nope
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   Just I just I'm making my 3a XL. I'm very happy with it. I just my facial recognition
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:15.640]   Have you been have you been paying attention to some of the reviews that seem to be dropping like crazy right now?
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   Now what I know you're gonna tell me about too
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.520]   Yeah, they don't like I find myself being thrilled less than
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:30.440]   Excited and I think one of the big disappointments for me that I'm hearing from multiple reviewers almost all of them is just battery
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.480]   Yeah battery. I feel like is just that's just one of those things on an 800 to 900 dollar device yet the nail battery
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.880]   And if you're not you're doing something wrong, but the 90 Hertz display. I'm sure it looks great
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   But is that really?
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.640]   Do we really need 90 Hertz on our phones?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.280]   necessary no
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   Turned it off because they know it's gonna just kill the already small battery
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:06.840]   Well, the weird thing is it only works when your screen is on full brightness or like a love 75% brightness
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.120]   Right, so if like you really have to make that choice like I want no battery life
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.560]   It's the anti dark mode. Yes
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.600]   It's the bright mode mr. Jarvis you said you wouldn't cite it
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.840]   But if you were a pixel - honor, would you be a side? I'd be very different very different. That makes sense. Yeah, you'd be excited
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.360]   Just upgrade to something new. It's been a couple of years. I that's what I have before I had the pixel - yeah
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.240]   And now I have the pixel 3a
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.840]   And the 3a is really happy
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.120]   Do you miss the squeeze I miss the squeeze that's what I was gonna ask
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.280]   Stacy you should try squeezing your 3a it doesn't work squeeze the bottom
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:56.720]   That's perfect. Yeah
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:03.240]   This thing for I guess I need to adjust it. It's only on the bottom. It's only the bottom
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.760]   Okay, it's not the bottom bottom. It's the bottom half
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.960]   Yeah, it's about of the bottom half of the sides
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.640]   Yeah, so I've been squeezing it kind of at the midline. So it doesn't do it. Oh, it did it there. Oh
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.560]   You're choking the phone
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.760]   There are there are sensitivity settings
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:33.560]   I just I was sad because I really use that a lot in my like day-to-day phone interactions
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:40.760]   I was like I kept squeezing it and it was like it's like she just hugged your phone and that right just just like I don't
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.480]   Choke it. I I never I disable that feature. I do too. Yeah, I hit it
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.800]   I just found like no matter what sensitivity I had it set to it would fire when I didn't want it to
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:58.080]   Same here. It's like stop it like I don't need you all the time assistant. I don't need you right now. All right same here
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   I think after five years of carpal tunnel
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.400]   Maybe my hand grip strength is so weak that I had never unintentionally squeezed it
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.680]   Apparently I can't even squeeze it when it's there, but like
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:17.120]   It's so great because I hate talking to my phone because I set off everything in the house and so the squeeze is just like
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:23.640]   I can just imagine 100 devices saying yes Stacy yes Stacy yes Stacy
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.240]   They also just added the drag from the bottom right corner
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.520]   Yeah, and orders of long the assistant. I think I have that on my swipe up on it
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.120]   Oh, yeah, I could show that if you if you really want to see it
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.640]   Yeah, so you have to kind of go in a in a diagonal from the bottom new and that does your system
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.720]   Okay, I never really got into the gesture
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.920]   UI on my phone. I just like it old school and this so this is the pixel
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:02.880]   This is to this is the two that's the two okay, but everybody at home uses the gesture interface
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.900]   I turned it off and I just I just like using old stock button and on the four
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:14.800]   Which you will be getting at some point soon to hear to you do have the ability to opt for the three button versus the gesture
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.160]   So that's still that I'm not savvy enough for gestures just yet in the new jet
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.400]   But you won't get if you do that you won't get the super assistant
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   Yeah, right so that's kind of crazy right like right now there was news that
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.360]   At least with the pixel 4 at launch if you have if you don't have gestures
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.700]   Activated then you can't access assistant makes no sense
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:45.800]   Absolutely no sense you can you can you still get assistant, but you don't get but not super awesome
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.240]   the
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   version
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.280]   What is super assistant I feel
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:04.760]   You get continuing conversations you get something else I don't know they were they talked about it at the at the so a lot more contextual
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.000]   Residence on the device right yes, exactly more of its on device
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.240]   You get a little bit of the fast response. So what it like reverts to old dumb assistant
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.960]   Like oh, you're not using you just
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.120]   Is down you just got the foot and not the butler
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.880]   Yes, so this is this is a trend. I think we're gonna see more and more especially as some people of G Suite either
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.080]   Right all right
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.920]   For you Jeff. Yeah, not only that like you can't you can't be you can't have it on your device at all
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.240]   It's not that you can't have G Suite account as your primary account
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   It just can't be there at all otherwise either at all which is just what Google weird
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.720]   These are the people who pay you it's so weird. Yeah
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.200]   So it's probably to do it like the read the limitations around G Suite are mostly about things like
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.800]   privacy and
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.960]   parsing the data
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.320]   So it could be the way that Google's handling that data is not compliant with what they've told there are professional
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.680]   Customers who want their data to be kept secure. It's not for folks like you and me Jeff. It's for folks the corporations
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.260]   If that makes sense, I know but they're Google they have they have the quantum supremacy. They could fix this
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.800]   I want so badly like I recommend to everyone. They're like, should I do G Suite? And I'm like, are you a Google user then no
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.680]   don't
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:34.520]   Yeah, what what other option would you suggest for a professional who wants to have like a small but high-end productivity suite?
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   Please don't say Microsoft
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   Yeah, that's about it. That's about it. It's about it. It's about it. You're like me if you're on a Chromebook
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:51.040]   Yeah, and you want to have your own domain. Yeah. Yeah, that's about it. I can't think of anything else
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.480]   That would be seamless day to day
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.720]   It's just kind of baffling to me how the G Suite over the years is always the punching bag for stuff like that
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.040]   Continually the punching bag it never gets any better for the G Suite users meanwhile
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   They're the ones that are paying and I know
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.640]   65
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.280]   Yeah, that's I mean, that's really the only other option which is I'm sorry. I'm not doing it
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:24.760]   So I mean and that's not all that's missing from the four
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.920]   RCS support
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.360]   Which the Pixel 3 has
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.040]   The before does not is not unsupported on T-Mobile and Verizon at launch even though the 3 is supported
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.160]   I didn't quite understand that story because I thought it also
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:48.400]   Put more onus on the on the particular carriers not necessarily the device so it's more on Google
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.680]   No, it's it's about it's about the carrier it is about the carriers
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.800]   Because the headlines that I was that I've been seeing have read as if this is Google's fault
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.520]   They screwed up and didn't make this available when I mean I always thought it
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:10.100]   It mattered most on the network not necessarily on the you could say that if this was a big priority for Google big enough
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:18.000]   Priority for Google Google would have made whatever relationship, you know or management that they needed to do with the carriers to make
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.200]   They could say this is not a device that's gonna sell in the billions. So who cares?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.000]   So right so why do they care? Yeah, there's that which I mean
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.120]   Which is unfortunate for for Google's next big market or messaging push
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:39.040]   You know because RCS was yet another messaging solution that was going to change everything
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:47.880]   On the plus side you guys it's been what six months or so since Google's last launched a messaging protocol
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   Wait a minute
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.480]   We can we can automatically switch between light and dark mode throughout the course of this episode
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.600]   We'll put you back into dark mode for this dual band GPS is is hardware that's supported on the pixel 4
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:13.080]   But it's not activated at lunch. So that's another thing that Google is kind of holding off and say as somewhere down the line
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:21.600]   We'll activate it just point after point after point it seems like there's all of these asterisks involved with the pixel 4 and
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.400]   I feel like in years past. Yes people poo poo the next device and then they get in like oh well
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   Actually, it's not that bad and maybe I'll find myself there too
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.680]   But I'm just getting kind of disheartened by a lot of these things right now
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.840]   And maybe that's because I just don't have it in my hands yet
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.680]   Well, that's the difference you need to see what it works for you and your personal experience on it
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.000]   All these reviews that that have been out there the last couple of days have been pretty downing
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.640]   And I get it for the most part, but I don't want to just put all of my stock in those just yet because like for example
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.000]   MKB HD as big as he is
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.920]   He has a different perspective when it comes to these these these devices and a use case I
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.640]   Remember him making a comment right at the end of his video basically saying you know
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.960]   Most people I wouldn't recommend this phone for and so I wanted to ask him
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.440]   How do you define most people and what is the phone that you want to wear them in cut off?
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Yeah, you know is it the iPhone? Okay. Why is it the galaxy note? Okay? Why sure? You know it
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:32.320]   But coming coming from someone who has the reach and the respect in the industry, you know
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.920]   As MKB HD does and he's kind of been a pretty big fan
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.600]   Until now so for him to say like I have a hard time recommending this for everyone
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:51.240]   That's kind of a big that's a big deal of my mind and see when he went into the rant about the 90 Hertz display
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.120]   and
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.360]   then you
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.480]   Top that off by saying most people do you really think most people know what 90 Hertz on a display is
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.640]   Most people probably aren't even gonna know that that the 90 Hertz display is is
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.040]   Going on or going on you know depending on the brightness setting whatever that is right
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.520]   So that's why I'm like why wouldn't he recommend it for most people, you know
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:20.560]   Just just for little comments like that, but I'm not taking a dig at you mr. Browning. I was just curious if they don't get this message
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.040]   So I want to do a review show where you hand you let go to a I don't know pick an office school a nurse
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:34.300]   I come I don't care and you give the device to people and you ask them to like hey
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.120]   Can you use this because I think
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.560]   In granted you should give it to him for a week and then come back, but that's in our world
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.240]   That's crazy long amounts of time, but yeah, mm-hmm
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.560]   I always I my test is it's not my mom because my mom is actually pretty technically savvy, but I
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:55.880]   Do I do think about like my mother-in-law and my father-in-law and I'm like yeah, can they use this?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.440]   Because I mean we're very
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   Well, actually not me because I'm a pretty normal person. I couldn't even figure out how to squeeze my phone. Oh, yeah, man. Really
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:13.080]   Normal as you sit and talk about the spectrum, you know and in wideband come on you're far from normal
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:19.800]   Other things I'm I'm not normal
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:29.400]   But maybe those are the things that you're not normal on open you up to an ability of ease like approaching some of these
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:37.800]   These phones from a perspective of ease versus someone who is completely outside of the realm of technology that gets it
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   They're gonna have a different opinion probably, you know
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.560]   I like her idea and I particularly do that with Queen Pruitt when it comes to these new phones and
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.280]   Still one of my favorite stories is is when I bought her the notes
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.480]   Eight, I think I believe it was what it was and I had to return it because it was too much
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:05.440]   It was too busy and she just could not dig that interface because previously she'd had the original pixel
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.400]   I think that's what it was. Okay, and she says can I have my pixel back? Yeah, you know
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.920]   You know that that struck me because I know she's not the most tech savvy person out there
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.000]   And she's always dropping the phone and busting it up, you know, but that's another story
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:28.960]   But for her to say this user interface is just not something that I can jive with at this time, you know that that
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.000]   surprise me. Yeah
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.240]   Yeah, what what is she using now? She's still using pixel 3 the pixel 3. Mm-hmm. Okay
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.040]   Great great phone. I'm still using pixel 3. Mm-hmm
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.400]   With the big bucket notch and all with a big bucket notch
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.560]   You can bring down the forehead on that and not look at the notch if that helps
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.200]   And there's another thing people still gripe about notches and things of that nature
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.280]   But yet they still want the technology behind the notch
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.000]   Right and so now they're complaining about the forehead on the pixel 4 and I'm like well
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.400]   You're moaned and cried about the notch, but you still need all of that stuff in this body for it to work. So
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.960]   You can't have it both ways. That's my opinion now granted
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.840]   I think one plus is doing a better job from the bezel standpoint, but
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.880]   They don't have radar, right?
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.360]   Right
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   Do they need radar? They don't
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:35.280]   That you know that that becomes the question that I have is you know a lot of the reviews that are coming out right now are
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   Saying saying a lot of similar things and solely seems to be very mixed where it's like, okay
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   It's not always reliable. It's totally underutilized
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.240]   But it does speed up things like face unlock. Mm-hmm. So I hope they patch it. I don't want anyway
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:57.760]   Which you know what anyway, which you know, and they've got a patch of so your eyes don't mean yeah, hopefully people oh boy
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.200]   I'm like, oh, that's terrible. Yeah, right so right now the face unlock will work whether your eyes are open or not
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.080]   And I don't know why you roll out that security feature with that even considering how did I pass Q&A?
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   I don't understand that's yeah
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.520]   Apparently that's the way maybe they were all wearing sunglasses like hand
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.040]   That's what I was supposed to bring there in the office. That's right
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.960]   Next week
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.520]   Big Amazon. Yes sunglasses and hair
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.160]   I'm gonna say about solely because I do think people don't understand what this is about
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.760]   I wrote about it, and this is not shameless self-provotion
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.360]   It's I feel kind of sad that I'm self-promoting, but I talked about
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   Why this matters and it's tied to
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:52.840]   Basically this idea when computing is everywhere you need a way to tell computers that you're talking to this particular device, right?
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.680]   and
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   proximity and the ability to
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:04.360]   Understand that you're right next to this device and asking you to question is going to be essential and it's I tied in the article I wrote
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.680]   yeah
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.560]   This to Apple putting uwb ultra wideband on their phones which they're using right now
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.680]   Or we're talking about them using for location-based services, but all of this is basically
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   Computing's and everything
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.960]   You're not gonna want to be like dishwasher. Please start now, right? You don't want to just just sing
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.680]   You're gonna yeah, you're gonna want to stand next to it and say like turn on or whatever and as
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   these devices start
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.760]   Having these radios they'll also understand when they're right next to things that they can also
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   Work with and I think this is gonna be way more exciting and Google's effort to put this on the pixel was really
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.160]   To get people started thinking about it, but it's also to see
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.880]   like what are the problems associated with this technology and
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:05.320]   What do we need to know about it? So I'm really high on solely. I'll be honest. I think you and mr. Tofel said it best
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:11.240]   Last week with with one word presence and that makes perfect sense there, you know in like
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:18.880]   Real like like presence like right now and did I tell you about my liquor cabinet example you did not please proceed
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:27.800]   So way back in like 2013 when I was getting excited and into the smart home
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.360]   I put a motion sensor on my liquor cabinet
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.800]   Okay, and the idea was when anyone opened it we get a notification this turned into a huge problem
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.840]   Because my husband and I were always opening the liquor cabinet my daughter
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.680]   At that time she was like six or seven so she wasn't interested right
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.800]   But we were what we wanted to do was have a Bluetooth sensor
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.120]   Tied to the motion sensor and I bought like an ambient
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.960]   sensor
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:59.160]   And the idea is I wanted when my husband or I were right next to the liquor cabinet opening it
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.760]   You don't have to send a notification
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.320]   Okay
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.040]   But if my daughter's next to it I want that notification because now she's 13 and she has all these friends and you know
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.840]   I like that use case
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   So in this is this is a
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:19.880]   example where proximity allows us to do things that right now are really tough and if if that sensor had
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.480]   UWB or solely and here's the next problem you guys there's gonna be a standard spite over this
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   Makes you so happy
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.200]   Like I just love a good standards. Fine. Um, it makes life so hard for users
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:40.120]   But that's that's where we're going and that can be in a friendly way
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.120]   So like you don't have to buy like I had to buy this separate Bluetooth sensor
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.880]   And there was like code that I had to download and I never got it working a hundred percent because it was just hard
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.480]   but
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.920]   How awesome would it be if you could just stick like a
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.920]   $12 sensor in your liquor cabinet and you'd know if your kid was like stealing alcohol
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.040]   Mm-hmm, and it's not just presents that you're talking about its presence and I and
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   an identification well presence proximity and
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.840]   Identification right because you need to know who is actually there because as we were talking about this
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   I was thinking well the nest mini going back to that product actually has something along these lines
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.800]   It has the ability to light up the the volume
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.320]   When it has an ultrasonic sensor it has an ultrasonic sensor
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.680]   So so it can detect presence and it can
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.240]   Improximate right but it has no idea who it is
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:35.360]   You know, I mean so that's the other critical part of this that's the start is to know oh, it is my daughter versus
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   It's me or my husband don't send me that notification. So
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.240]   Yeah, and ultrasonic sensors are all over the place. They're used a lot like, you know those water filter or water
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:50.480]   Delivery devices and airports, you know those filtration systems can feel up you think there's an ultrasonic system
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:57.600]   Sensor in there saying boop boop you're full or you're not full. It stops filling at the right time. Yeah
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.160]   Yeah, so that's it so uwb and radar both pretty expensive
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.600]   So they're different than the sensor that's in the nest mini
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.000]   But it's a similar use case because okay, I'll say that was super necessary in the nest mini because I mean beforehand
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.280]   You'd sit there and you're like I want to turn the volume and you just hit it randomly right where's the button?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:22.880]   Where do I tell you get louder softer ask you questions and you're like shut up. Just stop. Uh-huh just volume up
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.560]   Yeah, and actually one thing I just a couple of interesting things. We're totally hopping back and forth that that's okay
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.240]   A couple of interesting things I read today about the nest mini
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:39.880]   These new the new nest mini will allow you to pair a stereo pair of two of them
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.960]   So you could hook them up as stereo as stereo
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   I can go out on the ones before and what was the other one? I had oh, oh, oh quadriphonic
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   So you listen to dark side of the moon the way it was a red track. Yes
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.160]   And then another thing that it does it reintroduces the tap on top to start or stop playback
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.280]   If you remember the home mini did all right
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:12.760]   And they deactivated that because Artem Razakovsky from Android police had realized that it had been constantly recording him
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:19.360]   Because the fabric was registering as a touch so it was constantly like sending audio to the cloud instead of fix it
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:25.280]   They deactivated it entirely and they just never reactivated apparently on the nest mini. That's back. So that was one way to fix it
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.840]   They probably they realized oh that was an error in manufacturing
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.960]   Which is why I see they're stinging solely on the phone because they're trying to play with this new technology before they like
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.500]   Try to deploy it crazy wide. Yeah. Yeah, there was a funny tweet that I saw
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.280]   Last week I have it in the dock. It's by Ivan Kurek
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.440]   It's a compilation of of what was promised by Google was solely and then what was delivered
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.160]   And you know what was promised?
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.560]   You know the the concept video when they were first introducing it
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.480]   I mean, you know people are adjusting their watch with their fingertips
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:09.160]   So doing all these really cool things and everything you know flipping through presets on a radio and snapping to say okay
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:17.040]   Except and then it switches to the phone and no stay on it stay on it switches to the phone and it hardly switches the tracks anytime
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   They wave their hand over the top of it
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.440]   Get there I mean
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.120]   It's all of those things are still possible. It's just
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.320]   One day
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.880]   Software updates can get you to that
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.160]   And you know like because before I wrote wrote that story
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:43.040]   I actually read a 2016 paper on solely with all the equations and everything about the 3 millimeter accuracy
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.200]   It is pretty cool you guys
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.640]   They're gonna make it is it is cool technology
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   It is also isolating this phone in certain markets India cannot sell the pixel for or rather Google cannot sell the pixel for in
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.000]   India because they were not able to license the
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.480]   Spent spectrum the 60 gigahertz. Yes the 60 gigahertz spectrum in that in that country
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.920]   So therefore and and Google's made a lot of noise the last couple of years about how important markets like India are right
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.600]   But emerging markets as a college in markets exactly the next billion
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.200]   But you know is the pixel for a big seller in a market like that
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.040]   It's probably way more expensive than a lot of the phones that are offered right and are actually selling in that market
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   So maybe it's not maybe it was
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   It was fine. I don't know
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.960]   But
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:42.800]   We will find out I guess I'm looking forward to playing around with the device to see but I just want to use the camera
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.320]   I'm not necessarily thinking much about 90 Hertz. I'm not thinking much about
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.200]   All the other googly stuff that's built into the OS just I just want to see how well the camera works
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:00.040]   Yeah, so do I know and I'm sure you're gonna get answered to phone calls a month with it great
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.040]   I'm gonna
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   Have these did you guys order?
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.200]   Well, I mean Leo has his he's gone
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.160]   It's gonna deliver probably before my mind scheduled to deliver on Friday
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.800]   Leo got his order in during pre-order, so I expected it like today maybe tomorrow
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.600]   So you got three at least and then and yeah, yes, we have three did anybody order a
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.840]   Chromebook
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   Pixel go no
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.240]   Did not nobody order one no
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.680]   4i5 and that price in just
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.000]   I don't see that
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.120]   When I think about it like again, I have no reason to replace this thing this thing is the
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.840]   Pixelbook is still rocking for me. That's the same weight
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.320]   Yeah
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.360]   Yeah
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.040]   So I feel like it's fine like I don't feel like I need to upgrade to that one
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.240]   I'm curious about it and I would love to review it and spend some time with it
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.360]   But I don't feel like I need to replace this with that. It feels great
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.880]   Yeah, I'm with you on that I would I would still keep that I need a therapy session with Kevin
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:08.360]   So that's gonna talk you off of the ledge though until you know don't buy it
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.920]   No, no, I know you but then I got fair what else to get right you need something you can help you
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.600]   Yeah, I'll make sure I'll make sure Kevin
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.840]   Kevin gets in touch with you, you know, I was getting ready for that aces, but then it's only four gigs so
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.400]   new
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.000]   We'll see if he writes a special post on about Chromebooks Chromebooks for Jeff Jarvis
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.280]   You just might do that his ears are burning
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:43.160]   Can he program in a a a a blanket denial to any dark mode things
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:50.840]   None allow a dark mode denial by saw that thing today. What was it for the new the new chrome version?
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.040]   I got really scared it had instead of had forced dark mode. I was getting
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.560]   You must use dark mode
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.680]   But it was just saying that it would force dark mode even on
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:11.640]   An app that didn't have it. Yeah, yeah, right that and that even exists not gonna force it on me google
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.080]   Heck no, I did not call call you out by name. Thankfully
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.320]   If we could get access to Jeff's devices, I have a perfect april fools day prank for us
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:28.200]   Dare we have plenty of time to work on that. I know i'm like he's gonna be in the studio just
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.320]   Yeah, it's too bad. He's on this show and hearing us talk about it like literally right now
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.440]   I'm gonna treat the studio like a skiff enough for my phone in
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:43.560]   All right, let's take a quick break. I'm gonna thank the sponsor and then we can get into more awesome

[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.520]   We kind of glanced over the the whole
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.200]   Face unlock with eyes open closed or whatever, but I thought it's important
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.720]   I'm not sure if you guys talked about it last week whether it was news then or not that the samson
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.680]   galaxy s 10 to hear about this one that the fingerprint sensor
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.240]   Uh in display
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:29.000]   Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. There's a british couple that realized you know, this this woman set up the phone
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:36.440]   Learned it learned her right thumb on it and then she ended up by accident using her left thumb on on the sensor and it let her in
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.160]   She's like, oh crap. That's weird. You since she gives it to her husband both of her husband's thumbs
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   Work on it then she gives it to someone else something it turns out the screen protector that she ordered on ebay
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:56.120]   It's like three dollar screen protector. Um, samson saying don't use any screen protectors that aren't ours because this might happen
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.440]   really and so
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   Talk about like biometrics
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.520]   No, yeah
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.360]   How would know that is it just is it making the resolution?
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:13.320]   Or are less granular or is it just making it not work? So samson was saying a certain
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.360]   silicone based screen protectors which
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.520]   We're talking about it a little bit in in the after show of all about android last night
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:27.160]   Like I was thinking it was just like certain, you know flat screen protectors that you put on and then you you know get the like air bubbles out and everything
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.040]   like that uh victor who was who's the td for that show was like what if it's
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.520]   More like the you know the tacky kind gosh. I'm suddenly
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.240]   Blanking on the name of it. Um zag zag makes the invisible shield. Yes
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:47.720]   Maybe it's something like that because from what steve gibson on security now is saying yesterday is that it has something to do with like the
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.080]   The layers so you've got the camera shooting through the glass
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.000]   So that's one layer and then you have this like sticky silicone layer
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.640]   Into the glass protector into the fingerprint and there's something in those layers
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.000]   That's that's like imprinting a pattern into the fingerprint sensor
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.920]   When you learn that supersedes the layer that your fingerprint
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:13.480]   So it's learning the wrong thing. Yes generic thumb. Exactly
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:21.000]   Any thumb touched on it and it automatically it recognizes that there's a thumb there and it recognizes the
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.440]   The pattern from the layer the rundown is that a couple banks have now disabled
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.320]   uh thumbprint uh
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.680]   Verification for those phones. Yeah, right. They're not going to mess around with that. So
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.960]   And say i'm saying it's like, why don't you just buy ours?
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.440]   All you got to do is just buy our best that's the quick fix for it, right
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:50.200]   Exactly. No devs involved. Just just buy a new screen protector from us. Yep. So it turns out biometrics are not easy
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.960]   Yeah, because we have a little moment of silence for vr
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.840]   Yeah, let's do that
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.480]   Okay, we've done it. Okay
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Not all vr
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.280]   It's head in there
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.920]   VR on the phone. I don't know about all the
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.320]   Enough of any ecosystem right now. There's there's a lot of people that are jazzed about it
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.040]   Um, but mobile vr there was a lot. There's a lot of friction with mobile vr
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.880]   Yeah, it didn't it didn't make it easy for people regular people to just jump right in is even though it's so stupid
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:29.240]   Well, well if you play in a game, you don't care how you look if you're having fun. You don't care how you're looking, right? Yeah
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.960]   If i'm using vr usually everybody's asleep
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.920]   Looking dumb. Don't get me wrong. I'm in the middle of my living room looking
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:43.480]   I don't care. Think about the we days the nintendo we days. Do you think we looked elegant with
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:51.400]   Bowling and tennis living room fun, you know, no one care. We were just having fun. Yeah, I hate
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.240]   VR and I hate the arm because it
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.960]   I have to close off my vision of everything in the world and I don't feel safe
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   Okay, so I hate vr in it like in a trade show environment
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.560]   I I don't feel 100 comfortable in my home with it
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.960]   But so I have always been here. You're not gonna say finally I can get her
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   No, my dog my poor dog
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.480]   I trip over her so often now that she now whenever I stand up she like runs under the couch
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.320]   Oh my gosh, she's standing
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.120]   Get out of the way
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.280]   But so I will I will throw that out there because I feel like people
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.400]   I know i'm not alone in this
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.240]   So yeah, I feel like there's a whole bunch of people who are like, yeah, there's no way in hell
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.320]   i'm gonna like close off my vision
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.720]   And deprive myself of a sense just to play a game, but that's just what I are
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.760]   Aar's fine because you know
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.440]   Well as long as I can still see the outside world. I just I need to see what's coming at me
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Well, um
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:02.360]   Gosh, I've really really enjoyed vr the more I've gotten into the oculus quest
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   The more i'm like, all right, they're doing something right here
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.160]   And they actually they have a system that lets you see through
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.880]   To the outside world
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.640]   They call it the guardian system
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:21.960]   So, you know, you kind of you draw your area that you're in vr in and any time you get near that that boundary line
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.040]   It's like the real world starts to fade into your view while you're in vr
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.680]   So it's easy to kind of look outside and realize oh, you know, there's the there's the couch
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.760]   I don't want to trip over that or
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.160]   But I don't know if it's going to be that accurate if the dog walks into if your dog walks into your
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.600]   I am petrified and not not as much of my home
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.120]   But the reason I don't like it is because I I'm worried that someone's going to attack me
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:52.360]   It's just a it's a lifetime of being alert to someone trying to come after you. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, I don't fault that
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.800]   Yeah
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.920]   I I I still use my daydream
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.560]   To this day. What do you use it for?
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.800]   Well, I'm a yard, but what I'm like
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.400]   And it's not for gaming or anything
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.480]   I just like it for the theater mode when you put in Netflix or anything
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   I've never
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.680]   I'm never going to do
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.400]   If I can just grab my daydream and go to my favorite recliner
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.960]   Until everybody leave me alone
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.240]   What dad's watching the movie?
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:26.520]   Yeah, I will grab my I'll grab my favorite headphones plug it into the phone and fire up Netflix fire up my plex or what have you
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.160]   And it's it's so immersive because it's just like mr
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:34.600]   Stacey said it blocks out the environment so I don't see all the ambient light or anything like that
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.120]   And I don't hear my family or an intruder. Yeah
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:44.280]   You know, but excuse me. Uh, can I steal your uh
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.320]   But it's nice because
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   Especially like with Netflix is hulu they give you this whole living room environment
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.680]   Yeah, when you sit down and it just looks like you're looking at a
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.240]   150 inch screen
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:03.000]   And and you have great audio only years, but you can't yeah, you know, so I have this vision of a sitcom episode
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.240]   in which uh
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:11.960]   Dad prue it is on the recliner. Mm-hmm. And the family quietly moves all the furniture out of the room while he's watching
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.120]   There's an advertisement. It just don't take my chair. Yeah
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.400]   It's for BMW chair
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.800]   Was there is there there is a BMW ad where
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.720]   there
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.200]   The there's a guy and he's sitting there playing vr in an almost empty apartment
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:36.120]   And these two girls come in and take the last piece of furniture and walk out and stick it in the back of their nice bmw
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.680]   and the voiceovers like
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.600]   You know the bmw
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   Well, it's has room for all of your stuff
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.200]   Even if something and I can't remember the punchline
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.440]   But it's basically like and then at the end it flashes back to the guy in the how it he like pulls up his goggles
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   It he's like hello hello
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.400]   Oh, he's so immersed speaking of car commercial. He's lost
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.520]   What's your guess about the guy with the beard and the Volvo commercial? I think I'm taking him back to prison
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:09.880]   Haven't seen it. I've no idea. I've seen it. No, no never mind. Oh, okay. Is this on like standard television? Yeah
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:16.920]   I see right. Oh you cool cord cutters. I hold people watch cable tv
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   Oh
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.240]   Wow
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.160]   Settle but we all caught it that
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:35.480]   Astronaut
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.720]   Not seeing that ad
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.640]   You'll have to bring that next week. We're compiling a list of all the things we have to bring next week
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.480]   but even even with with Google cool killing this off
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:53.880]   Where does the folks at oculus stand and facebook and their investment behind us?
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:51:01.160]   Do you think they're going to continue to make the investment in it for another oh, yeah five years? I do I do
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:08.680]   I believe that they believe in it and I think that the oculus the the high-end oculus hardware has a really great path right now
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.120]   Samsung's gear VR headset is also done
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.360]   So that's kind of part of the reason behind this verge article that adi
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:24.600]   wrote is that Samsung you know, basically the note 10 was incompatible with the gear VR to which
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.320]   John karmack is the cto of oculus
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   Essentially you eulogized all right the headset to say hey, you know, it was good for what it was but
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.560]   We're done with it. We're moving into this area and then of course google
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.680]   No absolutely no phones that have been released in 2019 for what I understand our daydream
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:49.800]   View compatible 3a isn't the four isn't and so google's saying yeah, you know that that just
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.400]   Consumer adoption was low. It was decreasing over time
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.440]   There's just not a whole lot of demand there consumer adoption was lows because they didn't help it
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.320]   They didn't help people try to adopt it. They didn't push it the way they push the
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:09.160]   Newness many that you just was so excited to see you just born it, you know, that's not being
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.840]   That's kind of that's kind of google they get excited about things and then they lose their excitement and along with that
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.480]   Everybody everybody else
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   Did it because
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:27.960]   All right, so I was going to point out a story that's both cool about VR and a good example of why mobile VR doesn't work
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:33.080]   Or sorry, um, so this is an ours technica. It's about microsoft's dreamwalker
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.840]   This looked and sounded suit. I mean I would never use it because again
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.520]   I do not want to be in a virtual world when I'm out in the real world, but
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.880]   They have it basically maps where you are in the physical world
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:52.440]   And creates a VR world around it that is built on top of actual obstacles that you'll encounter
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.400]   So it gives you reasons to like stop it across walk for example
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:01.320]   So it's pretty cool. I mean, but if you scroll down in the article that I linked to
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:08.600]   Um, it's in the show notes. Um, you see the guy with his headset in this backpack computer and
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.680]   Scroll down
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   There it is
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:19.480]   No big deal what that's just a random person to get attacked. No every day person
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.400]   But
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.760]   We've all done that i'm not going to get a tet and probably not going to get a date either
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:30.920]   Yeah, this is why it's not, you know, awesome, but at the same time i'm like that's kind of a fun use case if
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.360]   Again, if you're not worried about being attacked, right
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   Have you heard about the void? Yes, I would love we have that in in the oculus
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.520]   So it's not it's not oculus, but it's in the oculus at world trays center in New York
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.800]   Oh that I was like
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:57.400]   Yeah, it's like a wars experience and avengers experience event event center where you can go and it's like a large scale
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:03.480]   uh, VR roaming VR where you have the backpack and um, right and there are objects
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.120]   in the space that like
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:12.920]   The virtual objects that you see are matched with physical objects that you feel when you reach out to touch certain things and
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:18.840]   Everything like that. I love I love that and I think that's that's got a big future for VR
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:25.160]   And if anything else that does see I think that works soon because it takes me back to the days of laser tech. Yeah
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:31.880]   Oh laser tech. Yeah, I remember oh I was I still play laser tech because I've got a 13 year old so
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:38.200]   Same here. Nice. Nice. Nice. Still a thing. Still a thing that happens. Yeah
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:43.240]   And it's better than paintball because you don't get whacked with hard balls of paint
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.440]   Right. Yeah
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:49.400]   Although that's kind of the beauty of paintball too because then there's actual fear behind playing it
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.360]   You know like actually I really don't want to get shot
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.640]   It's been a long time I played paintball and it was frightening
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   But also really kind of a lot of fun because it was so frightening man
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:06.600]   You just really don't want to get hit when you're playing paintball. Not even I'm still thinking this whole
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:11.560]   Consumers not latching on to this VR thing. Yeah, I'm thinking about homes
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:17.320]   You need a lot of space in your home more than like yeah, true for these these apparatus is to work
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   Um, I don't care how good it is
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   But if they don't have the spot for their their rigs or whatever in the spots to to move around freely
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   It's not going to catch on
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.640]   Is there anything being done for?
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:36.200]   The average joe's room to be able to enjoy VR that you that you guys know of
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.920]   You could put your coffee table and sofa on casters and just roll it out of the way
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.480]   Okay, there's that option
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.760]   I have a friend to um
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:54.200]   She does development for VR when they built their house. They actually built a room for her to work in okay that was a
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.280]   VR room
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.880]   and so
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:03.320]   I think the walls were painted. I think dark gray or maybe a lighter gray for some reason. That's easier
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:09.560]   Um, and it was empty and it has specs in terms of like how wide it needed to be
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.120]   um, so
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.080]   Yes, but she that's her job. I mean, right
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.280]   Rolling your friend to trouse out of the way is probably the way to go now
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:23.480]   Right not every not every house is going to have an obvious space for this like in our living room
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.480]   We don't have a coffee table in our living room. So automatically in the in the the
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   Front you know in the center of our living room. I mean, it's not the hugest where do you put your feet?
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.680]   Where do you eat dinner?
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.960]   That's the question
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.000]   We we have an ottoman for our feet
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.720]   We don't need a coffee table for that
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:52.840]   But I mean but I can make that work and I mean to answer your question like just taking the quest is one example
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.560]   the quest can operate in
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.520]   In kind of like a standing or sitting mode it can also operate in a free roaming mode
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:05.480]   And when you do that kind of free movement mode, that's when you draw the boundaries
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.040]   So you can really make any amount of space that you have
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:12.760]   Usable space and within the game that becomes just a little bit more dynamic
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:17.000]   You know in a small room you'll have a little bit of of wiggle room to work back and forth
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.840]   But in a larger room like one day
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:23.160]   Um when I was borrowing lios, I came in here after all about anorid was done
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.720]   So there was nothing going on in the studio and I cleared everything like I pushed this table back
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:33.800]   I cleared it all out and I tried that and I mean I was walking around the grocery store and job simulator
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.600]   And it was just like I could go behind it
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.080]   I could do things that I just didn't think were gonna be possible
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.920]   Right and it was it was really cool like it was awesome
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:49.880]   And tjd just says that the riff needs five by seven feet usually that that's not very big
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.960]   And I could see that you know I could see that being feasible in most homes
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.720]   But something like a rift needs a big system to power
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.200]   Yeah, so when you're talking about like
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:05.720]   Wide mass adoption or whatever, you know the everyday person in enjoying or experiencing
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.640]   VR that's that's where something like the quest seems to be the right approach
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.240]   And by the way, the quest is not off topic for this show because it is powered by android
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.240]   So there you go there we go
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.760]   You get that in there
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.720]   I love how you feel like you have to justify yourself when when it's just leo jeff and i were just like
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:29.080]   Last week you're not your one the one the ab normal 20 minutes
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.760]   Was that what's our car?
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.840]   We talked about the Beatles for 20 minutes
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.040]   I was not in favor of that by the way
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.520]   No, man. I wish I was here for that conversation
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.240]   No, Jason you would not
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.360]   I could have I could have pitched it. I could have held my own from probably for a little bit
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:50.200]   Gosh, so so when are we gonna talk about quantum computing sure right now wait now or or
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.880]   Serial because I don't understand what that is. What is the serial?
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.880]   Yeah, how did how did we go through the pixel four thing and not talk about serial
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.680]   Doesn't that just make sense?
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.200]   The UK wasn't some yes, we're delivered in cereal boxes
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.200]   Yeah, so I guess it's a it's a promotion happening only in the UK
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.840]   They only had 2000 of these being sent out but people some of the first customers are receiving
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:21.720]   Their pixel four in the UK in what is a cereal box that looks, you know, it actually has some cereal inside
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:25.880]   So they're multi-colorable cereal. That was like yes
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:31.480]   Yes, no, I mean nine to five google posted a gallery and full review they said
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.120]   100 percent of your daily allowance of magic curiosity and feeling lucky
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:42.760]   These are cheerio wannabe hoops with google branded marshmallow bites and what they believe to be small
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.240]   meringue gems
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:50.040]   That's cute and I think the final verdict is that the price per pack of around
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.000]   $799 makes it really hard to recommend
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.960]   Picking up a box unless you really need 16.77 million colors in your bowl
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.080]   Wait, there's a prize inside, right?
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.200]   Yeah, it happens to be a phone, right?
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.440]   A phone but no headphones by the way
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.520]   Aren't gonna get headphones in the box of pixel four which is a little interesting too
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:18.600]   Happy you brought up the celery cereal. Okay. Yeah, I saw that in the rundown. I was so confused
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.800]   All right, how about this? Yeah, I put that out was I was overjoyed with that. I went I went pixel four cereal. I that I'd get
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.840]   Absolutely. I mean it looks magically delicious. It's cute
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   Let's see here
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:39.640]   Okay, so this is one of those stories that like I read it. I'm like, okay. This is interesting
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.040]   I don't I have no idea the science behind it or they're
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.240]   Soon dar's interview is very interesting way
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.240]   Okay, all right. I did not read
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.520]   that
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.040]   This allows them to
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.640]   the practical use that he came out with was that it it allows you to
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.520]   Model a molecule and all of its forms
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.280]   And could have huge impact on medicine and things like that
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.920]   And the cash being alone
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.880]   Has 10 to the 48 different
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.440]   something's
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.080]   And something it would take quantum even the quantum computer couldn't do all of its
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.440]   Something's something. Okay, right. Um, so what is what are you?
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:27.400]   Yeah, we have to actually have to introduce this so google. Oh, sorry. No, that's okay. I like to go
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.360]   Oh, we did. Oh, with the paper leaked. We talked about it. Right. We
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:40.200]   Like the official release of it. This is the official release the paper. Yeah, so google officially released a paper declaring itself
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   Uh declaring that it had reached quantum supremacy and i'm going to put those words in quotes
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.000]   Because quantum supremacy the idea behind this is it was I think was proposed like
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.840]   seven or eight years ago and the idea was a
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   To perform a task in a time much faster than practical than a
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.320]   Traditional computer could perform it practically
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.920]   Um, it's a little bit of a moving target
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.040]   But google said that they had achieved a quantum computer named sycabore
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.880]   And it is a 54 qubit processor if you're tracking qubits the last qubit computer
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   I think we talked about was like 36 or so
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.840]   So this is the arp how many qubits was the ark?
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   Oh 40
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   It's an old joke. No, what?
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.920]   It took me a minute jeff
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.400]   Sorry
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.640]   These are qubits with a q not with a c
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:46.360]   And they basically said that they could do this faster than the fastest supercomputer out on the planet today
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.600]   Um, I forget what they were computing though
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.080]   Was it molecules? It's like random numbers. Yeah, it was random numbers and something. Yeah, okay
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.880]   So they were doing that now ibm came out into like
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.480]   Uh, I don't think so our fastest computer because google said it would take it 10 000 years
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.160]   ibm is like
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.320]   No, we make the fastest supercomputer on earth and it would take it 2.5 days
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.960]   So that so ibm, so yeah, so there's like this little like fight over
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.640]   length of time the bigger thing and so that's kind of
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.960]   What's happening now?
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:31.400]   The big thing is quantum computing is important because it allows us to solve problems that we haven't been able to solve with the traditional computers
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.880]   Right and it does so in a completely different way. So like what jeff's talking about with the molecule
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:41.720]   when a computer is trying to when a traditional computer is trying to like figure out the position of
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.280]   all the
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.000]   Addams in a model molecule it's atoms and the parts of the atoms in a molecule
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.080]   It has it's going to start crunching those numbers and doing the modeling and as it gets
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.400]   Successively larger. It's going to slow down
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:02.360]   Because it's just too much and it's going to be like it's kind of like if I were running a marathon
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:09.000]   My first mile would be okay. My second mile would be okay. Actually my second mile would be dead too, but i'm going to get progressively
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:17.240]   In a quantum computer, it's like I were running the marathon except i'd be driving a car and i can just maintain the same steady pace
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.520]   so
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.800]   That's
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:25.000]   That's how to think about this so google's argument that they've achieved quantum supremacy is they can do this in a way
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.880]   That's a faster than the supercomputer, but be they never ever ever slowed down
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.960]   So that's the big oh oh and i was explaining why it was important
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.560]   Because there's a whole class of problems and complicated things we can't currently do on today's super computers
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.760]   And especially in an era of like climate change drug discovery. This is going to be important
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.640]   Also, it will help with wall street trading
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.920]   Okay, hopefully that helped
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.800]   And hopefully y'all didn't all fall asleep. I'm sorry. No
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.160]   When I hear about quantum computing, I i'm trying to think about real world stuff
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.000]   And the fact that you put in you know the stock market in
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.520]   Climate control that that makes a little more sense now
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:13.000]   Because we have right now it can take days for a full on weather simulation to take place
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.920]   So like when you're predicting like a hurricane
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.640]   Back on a supercomputer that's a lot of time and it could take a lot of time to understand what happens
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.760]   But imagine if you could do that in five minutes one
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:30.200]   You can run so many more models, which means you can add in like data points as they come in right so like
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.840]   So that's going to be really a huge
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   I mean weather modeling is a huge
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.480]   Science problem
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.480]   Right when we're dealing with so many
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.040]   You do it with something that's got a moving target like
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.560]   Forecasting I guess that makes a lot more sense because you get all these extra variables
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.280]   And like you said you're throwing these extra data points
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.760]   It um, we can speed up the process of figuring these things out. That's what you're saying, right?
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.120]   Yes, okay
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.440]   And there's there's tons of other things. I mean like we don't even know I mean part of this
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.880]   We don't even know and there's the whole cryptography debate because it could break like 256 AES encryption very
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:10.520]   easily um random numbers. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, so here's here's sundars
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:17.000]   Um, the other reason we're excited. He says is take a simple molecule caffeine has two to the 43rd states
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:26.280]   Then mit technology review has a footnote saying caffeine with 24 atoms can exist in 10 to the 48 distinct quantum states
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.920]   IE configurations of these atoms that means for a classical computer to perfectly represent caffeine
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:40.520]   It would require 10 to the 48 bits close to the number of atoms in the entire earth 10 to the 49 or 10 to 50
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.840]   A 1 gigabyte memory chip has about 10 to the 10th bits
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.440]   I'm sure that would be very helpful
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:53.240]   I got you. I was like I'm with it. So the other thing though. We have to think about
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.400]   When we think about computing immense computing power, right?
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.280]   So like you've got massive super computers that consumes a lot of energy to model these things right?
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.560]   Right
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.320]   Right now quantum computing if it can do it super fast
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.040]   And yes, we'd still have to cool these down tremendously. We could end up saving energy. We might not though. I don't know
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.280]   That's that's still an open question. Will quantum computing be more energy efficient?
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.160]   And I think that's something we should be thinking about the current
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.440]   Climate as it were well when well when can we find out and you they're saying they've achieved these
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.920]   quantum computing
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.240]   So quantum computers live in these
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.920]   In these uncertain states no, they live in these um, they live in
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:46.120]   We don't have good programming tools. So right now you can't do whether every time you write something for a quantum computer to do
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.200]   You write it from scratch, right?
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:54.360]   Um, and there are very few people who know how to program a quantum computer. Okay, they all get google or IBM, right?
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.400]   So there's that that's your quantum quantum computer
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.720]   like they they're they're not
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:06.760]   It's not something you can like buy off a shelf or oh no I get that but i'm just saying if you could leo what about one
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:12.120]   If people if we have people that are able to sit down and write to write the code behind it
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.280]   Okay, so where are they putting this code?
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:20.760]   All right, so now if they've put this code on some piece of hardware and i'm just saying it's layman's terms like
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:26.600]   When do we put this stuff into place to where we can reap the benefits of quantum?
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:33.160]   So the challenge is well this exists google has a quantum computer. I think well it has that
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.440]   Um, IBM has a quantum computer
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.040]   I believe Lockheed martin has their own but they may be sharing with google. Okay, these are
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:48.920]   Billions, I don't know how much a quantum computer like these are these are so research like they cost a lot of money
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.360]   They're they're they're persnickety to use. I don't know why i'm doing this gesture
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.800]   Because we're talking about solely you're turning down the volume
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.560]   So persnickety you've got to move in tiny increments
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:08.440]   Um, so this is this is not a computer that like you can have access to yet are there universities with quantum computers
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.240]   I feel like the us governments concern that china has like secret quantum computers in
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.640]   and they they they operate at sub zero temperatures. That's
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.760]   like
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.120]   They're not
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.640]   They're not ready for even close to commercialization. Yeah
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:33.000]   Yeah, I just like I said, I just think about all of these capabilities and say hey we when we figure out quantum computing
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.160]   We can do a bc or d and then you get an article that says hey, we figured it out
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.600]   So my next question is when are we going to do a bc indeed at you?
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.520]   So so soon dar talks about this and where he said that that he was talking with heart mooten evan
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.880]   Who leads the quantum tvela with john martinez
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:56.280]   The chief's carver scientist for google and then he told me dropped out of his phd in material science
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.920]   Uh people around him were working on high temperature superconductors. That was 26 years ago
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.160]   I was sitting in the lab, but i'm like wow, this is gonna need a lot of patience to go through
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.200]   So he leaves and goes and becomes wild the you know rich wearing google god bless him
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.800]   Um, he said I felt like I didn't have that kind of patience
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.440]   I have deep respect for the people in the team who stayed on this journey a long time
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.400]   Pretty much all fundamental breakthroughs worked that way he need to have a long-term vision
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.120]   He he then reminisced about how deep blue beat kerry kasparov in 97
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.560]   And then we hit b now for go in 2016
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   You think the one hand well, that's a long time, but the progress to get there is incredible
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.680]   Right now if you have that long-term view
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.560]   Uh, then no, it's not going to happen next week. Uh, the butterfly wing to the storm. We're not going to figure out
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.240]   but
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.360]   You know if you're a scientist like like these folks are just seeing that
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:57.160]   The road you're on also. I think what's really important here that he mentions is they see the end of moors law coming
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.960]   And they're I think worried about it. Okay, because that's what that's what enables
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.280]   They're like, uh, oh, we're gonna hit the hit the dead end
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.400]   Uh, and they continue. Yeah, well, yes, uh, but they need to continue growth
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.320]   Uh, so dar says moors law is what made google possible?
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.800]   But can it run doom?
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.200]   Our crisis
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.880]   On the chat room has some really good things he he or she I don't know adds that
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.400]   We don't have to worry about breaking encryption until we get to a thousand qubits
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.280]   I have not fact checked this but i'll say okay
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.200]   And they pointed out that ibm will let you uh run a quantum algorithm if you want to write one
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.720]   um
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.960]   on one of their developer computers for free
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.640]   But
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.400]   It only has five qubits and so so that's not useful then right?
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.960]   No, it could be useful. It depends on what you want to do. I mean quantum computing is just again
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:01.320]   It's like walking versus driving a car you can do things walking like normal computers walk quantum computers or cars, okay? So
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:07.560]   Remember before there were cars. We had a very different worldview. So yeah, yeah
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:13.880]   Sure did just give me another horse. That's what they said. Yeah, so I got you
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:21.160]   And and I don't know I'm like I had this vision that elon musk has a quantum computer in his bathroom
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.480]   Why would you put in your bathroom? It reads the news just to show off. It's kind of a humble brag thing
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.280]   Yeah, you're your old school there. He's tweeting from it
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.680]   No, he's tweeting from space
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.920]   That's cool
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:42.520]   He tweeted from space today. That's that's a real story. Yes. Oh really? Yes. Yes
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.440]   You want it? Yes
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.920]   That wasn't karsten's fantasy. I know it was pretty. Yes. He's actually on the rundown
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:57.820]   Oh, there we go elon sends tweet via space x's starlink satellite browser explains something to me here miss st
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.320]   We can both of these
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.840]   All righty
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:07.240]   How can't with all that distance how to can they get the speed and the latency so low this speed high latency low
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:14.040]   But it's have to go that far. I'm assuming it's a what spectrum are they using? Hold on
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.320]   I have paid much attention to these because I feel like they're
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   Full of crap. Yes. Okay
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:26.120]   And I love how you are on the same like the same thing
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.720]   Um
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.080]   So I don't the answer is I don't know in this particular case
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.800]   Usually when you want to boost your speeds
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:44.280]   Or redo you can't really reduce your latency unless you get closer, but you can increase your capacity and to do that what you do is you
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.440]   uh
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.040]   Wide in the area that you're willing to use
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.080]   To send the bits down. I don't know how to explain this without like
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.720]   Just just be you you go ahead. Just be you you be you but but wait because I don't
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:09.480]   I I literally don't know what spectrum they're using if they're like what band they're using and all of this
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.800]   So this is hard for me. Okay, um
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.400]   But if I read it, I can come back to you and tell you in this week's episode of stopstacing. Wow, that's right
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.720]   I don't see this often
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:26.280]   No, I like I can explain broadly how satellites tend to work. I cannot explain. Let's see where well
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.680]   How about how about this? We'll take a break. There you go. Maybe that's enough time to read
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.400]   Yeah, and if it's not don't worry about it
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.280]   It's all good. You're off the stakes
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.960]   All right. Let's take a break this episode of this week and google is brought to you by zap
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.880]   You're you probably already know this maybe maybe you've experienced this yourself, but growing a business is hard
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:54.600]   It's not easy. You don't want to be wasting hours every day moving data from emails over to spreadsheets to your crm to wherever you need it to go
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.120]   Uh
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.680]   That should just kind of happen and with technology that should be easy. Well now is zap here
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.000]   Uh, you can it does become easy zap here can actually help with that
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:11.880]   Zapier has over 1500 plus apps and is the easiest way to automate your work
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:19.400]   So you can focus on what amat what matters most and that's connecting all of your business software to things like engaging your leads instantly
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.520]   Also automatically importing new customers. Maybe notifying your team about opportunities
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.720]   Really disguised the limit your imagination can run wild and that's because zap here is
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.600]   Super customizable. They support multi step zaps now
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.880]   Uh, so the possibilities are virtually endless

[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.760]   No more wasting your time on tasks that you know could be automated because that's exactly what zap here
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.840]   Was built to do just go to zap your dot com slash twig
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.360]   Then you can go in there and connect the apps that you use the most
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:00.600]   And let zap here take it from there best of all it's easy to build the exact solution you need in minutes
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.680]   Without writing code you're not going in there, you know writing code or anything
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.960]   You aren't going to need to ask a developer for help
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.440]   It's all super straightforward and made for you to understand it right away
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:18.280]   So join more than 4.5 million people who are saving an average of 40 hours per month
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.080]   By using zap here. We're using it here in house
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:29.640]   One of the things that i've i'm so familiar with is moving my transcripts or the the the transcript for the teleprompter
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.880]   Uh for tech news weekly and you know, it's usually like save out of google docs rename the file
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.240]   Move it over to the drop box that appears here and zap here makes it an automated process
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.960]   So i love that i could just set that up
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.440]   Uh that the mic actually
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.680]   Yeah, so that's a mic as far as that's a mic at the end of my
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.880]   No, no, no, I would not want to take his credit, but i love that you can and then you can do that
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:59.400]   Mike has actually had a lot of experience with zap here prior to them being uh on the network
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.840]   So it's uh, it's cool. He's kind of passing down the knowledge
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.400]   Make more time to grow your business right now through november try zap here free
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:14.280]   By going to zap here dot com slash twig that's zap i er dot com slash twig for your free
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.760]   14 day trials app here dot com slash twig
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.400]   And check it out for yourself when we think zap here for their support of this week in google
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.880]   Are you can answer your questions boom boom boom checking in with stacy on the answer to the question
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.440]   Stacy once we find the right camera for
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:39.240]   All right, so the latency numbers are as I suspected how close they are to the earth
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:46.440]   Um, so you just simply don't have to go as far the space x satellites are going to be launched at uh about let's see
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.160]   Hope got open up the file
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:56.440]   1,100 to 1,300 kilometers above the earth an in marsat satellite is
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:01.720]   35,000 kilometers above the earth so that's a lot of miles
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:07.000]   Um, so that's late 1,300 kilometers and miles is 807 miles
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.480]   Okay, 807 versus 22,000 miles
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.720]   so
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:19.640]   Big difference right. Um, so that's how latencies affected we do the show over this connection
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:27.000]   Um, I don't know because are all the satellites how many of them are actually launched so the other thing is
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.840]   Yeah, but he's gonna have like it's gonna be there's gonna be no sunlight he's gonna have so many of them
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.160]   25
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.600]   They're talking about 25 seconds of latency or is it milliseconds?
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.680]   Okay, so
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.600]   Seconds be bad. Yeah, I was like, right if it's 25 milliseconds
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.200]   When do we I thought it was was it?
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.720]   Of course now we can't measure latency sometimes on the show. Yeah, 25 milliseconds is not bad
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.400]   It's not bad
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.240]   It's not bad. Yeah, it's not good for robotic surgery a latency of 20 milliseconds is normal for boi calls
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.000]   A latency of even 150 milliseconds is barely noticeable
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.360]   Ta-da now we know what okay, um, thank you google and
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.960]   The capacity is because there are so many of these things
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.480]   And the sea change that has happened here is that let's see
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.000]   It used to cost a lot of money. It used to cost, you know a couple million 25 million
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.680]   To launch a satellite and satellites themselves cost a lot of money with the small cube
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.720]   Kind of as you get a bunch of a bunch at the same time
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:40.840]   He's already launched a couple and he has permission to deploy up to 11,943
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.600]   And if you install that space junk is it that is a wonderful question
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.200]   MIT tech review if you google those two things space debris
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.440]   MIT tech review they had someone answer that question just this week
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.280]   Currently currently there are already 22
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.000]   2,500 satellites in orbit
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.800]   So this is a lot more satellites than
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:13.080]   Yeah, then he currently has and now he's lower down than most satellites. So we'll get in the way of like the space shuttle
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.320]   Oh, okay. Here you can hear you
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.880]   No, I was talking about all the satellites that exist
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:28.360]   Right in toto like all the satellites that have ever been launched is that are in space now is 25,000
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.840]   So he wants to have five times as many satellites as are
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.680]   currently
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.280]   out there wow
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:45.080]   And one of the big challenges with these like smaller start smaller satellites and the startup operators that are coming out for this is
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:53.240]   What's going to happen to that stuff when it starts to degrade and break down or what happens if those companies got a business?
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.000]   So like yes, the satellite industry is fraught with bankruptcies, right?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:04.520]   But throughout those they've operated and made sure their satellites don't run into other satellites and that's actually a continuous process
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.000]   so
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.320]   How this is handled? I really don't know but it is a legitimately interesting question that people should be and probably are thinking of
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.920]   I'm just not because I have other
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:24.040]   Got other things to worry about leave it to you on musk. He'll figure it out
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.880]   Cool. I'm happy that we could get there
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.800]   I was like, I don't know if that was worth coming back to you, but now you know
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.800]   No one's at the battle. That's what they say. Oh, oh
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.760]   Uh, I asked the questions mindful
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.160]   Thank you
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.600]   Uh, let's see here. What else do we got? We got?
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:51.960]   Feel like we've got some little looking bits and pieces are around google. We've got stadia. Oh, sorry
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:57.560]   The fi the fi dual connect. Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah down in the land right blog. Yeah, so
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:04.120]   Fi is going to get an upgrade google fi a new upgrade called dual ken duel connect technology as jeff said
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.320]   This essentially means that the fi devices
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.640]   Starting with the pixel four it's going to roll out eventually to other fi devices
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:18.280]   Uh, but for right now just the pixel four will be able to connect to two networks at once for faster switching
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   This doesn't mean that data is going to be faster
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:26.600]   Because it can only listen to two networks at once it's not using them both at the same time
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   Although that would be pretty cool
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.480]   But I imagine if it was using them both at the same time then you would would that be like a two data
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:42.520]   Data plans. That's like those days. Yeah, when you used to yeah, it's like the backpacks that leo with leo was broadcasting the live view
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.920]   Oh, yeah, we had like rear four sims, right? Right
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.960]   Right, so I don't know that five would necessarily say hey, we'll double it and uh, we won't charge you anything extra for that
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.880]   That seems seems costly if they were to do that, but this doesn't do that anyways
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.200]   So yeah, so this would be for I guess a fister
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.160]   Handing or handoff that's a handshake
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.440]   Yeah, you won't notice it from one to the other. It's pretty slick
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:14.040]   So yeah, it's a nice feature. I haven't been using fi in a while. I am using mint mobile
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.000]   They are a sponsor on the network and I imported my number over to mint
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.560]   So I've been off of five for a little while right?
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.680]   I remember you doing it and you I know you've been pretty happy with I've been super happy. Yeah
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.560]   I mean features like this, you know are are nice
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.080]   You know, especially especially something like this is nice to hear that uh that it's improving and everything
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.320]   Are is anyone here still using fi or i've never been on fire
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.040]   Never been on fi you've never been on fi
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.720]   Jeff use you use it for for your international
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.160]   Yeah, yeah, and fi makes a lot more sense for someone like you doing a lot of travel
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.160]   Didn't make as much sense for me. I was in uh, columbia and my atnt wouldn't
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.320]   Um connect to the network. I've spent two hours in the phone with atnt and finally got a connect for data number of a voice
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.040]   So i'm really glad I had the separate phone right
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.680]   That's good
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:14.040]   Um, I actually liked fi I like this the kind of in-app support that sort of stuff
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.800]   But I just I felt like there were certain features that were just kind of lost on me
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.120]   But then I did just go to victoria british columbia a couple of weeks ago
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.080]   And sumo brag didn't have well
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:31.080]   I say it only to point out that I didn't have a data connection there. Oh, and if I had five
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.400]   I think i would have been fine then yeah
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.680]   So, you know, I could I could have added it if I wanted to but I didn't I didn't need to know I had uh
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:44.760]   Had had the plan so we just used her phone, but so if there are there are benefits for sure
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.840]   Um
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.680]   I know this is interesting so right now going on in the bay area is the android developer summit
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:57.800]   That's happening right now. It's kind of the oh the talk if if google i/o is the tick
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:05.160]   Yep, then uh and does summit is the talk for developing a paltrack mentioned in that was that a sauvajena paltrack mentioned this
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.840]   this morning
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:12.200]   Yeah, google announced they they basically gave an update on trouble trouble is of course the
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:20.440]   the components of android they're they're kind of effort to speed up the updating of these devices by by
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:27.720]   componentizing parts of the os and you know, this was introduced I think at this point three years ago
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.960]   I believe off the top of my head
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.120]   so we're starting to kind of
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:38.520]   Wonder, you know, is this actually making a dramatic effect on android devices being updated which is just constantly
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.320]   Such a such a huge deal
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:48.040]   Um, so they announced that this year 12 oem's just one example of how trouble is helping this year 12 oem's
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.160]   Participated in the q beta that was up from seven oem's for pie so they're increasing
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:00.600]   The ability for oem's lowering the bear the the boundaries and the barriers for oem's to offer the q beta
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.480]   So they say that's as a result of of trouble
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.240]   But this is kind of a little more interesting they said in 2018
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.400]   Android 8 was on 8.9 percent of all phones right before pyres release
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.600]   So basically think of it as android 8 was out almost a year in 2018 and they were it was at 8.9 percent of all devices
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.240]   man, that is pathetic yeah
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.160]   same same time period for android 9 before 10 was released
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:31.240]   And it was at 22.6
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:38.760]   percent of devices so then think of that as android 9 a year later was on 22.6 percent of devices still not great though
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.320]   Still not great but an improvement but you're right still not great like
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.080]   Ah
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.400]   One year after an os is released 22.6 total advice devices
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.440]   It needs to be so much better than that. I really hope that that continues to end into google's credit
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.320]   This is working out. This is working out perfectly with its
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:04.180]   January 2020 mandate of you know any of these new oem devices have to be ready to go
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.940]   With the latest version of android it's fourth and forever more
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:14.980]   So we'll probably see that number a much a little bit higher next year hopefully so yeah
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:22.500]   Yeah, 7.0 took 18 months to reach that position of 22.6 percent
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.740]   so
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.460]   Man it used to be a lot worse but it's still not great
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.460]   Yeah
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.660]   And uh another other improvement Samsung
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:38.660]   As one example started its 10 rollout on october 12th last year it was november 15th
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.300]   So google's just pointing to and then also one plus and essential
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.940]   What's really happening with essential?
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.980]   Um
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:51.300]   Couple of handful of manufacturers that are getting their updates out almost on the same day
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:55.860]   That google is releasing its updates. So that's all really positive. Yeah, it is
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.460]   Um
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:02.820]   But but that's still sort of niche. Yeah, totally, you know, yeah things really do
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:08.020]   What's happening with all of these Samsung devices out there that are you know still lagging behind
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:14.580]   That are really capable of running the updated OS, you know, what's happening with those devices. Absolutely
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:18.980]   So yeah
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:26.020]   Can you help me understand something i'm trying to i was thinking back to the the whole nexus premise of google, okay
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.900]   Miss miss stacey or mr. Jarvis if you all know as well
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.860]   Was the premise of the nexus line?
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.100]   umpteen years ago
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:40.100]   Just a way to sort of set a standard of what android is supposed to be like and what the oem's are supposed to
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:45.380]   Try to you know aim for far as when they made their their phones and made their
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.500]   um their software to sort of mimic whatever
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.980]   Google's pure android was is that was that the premise of it?
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   I thought it was a reference design for a hardware
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:03.380]   But also really a folk because everyone was sticking out of those bloatware on the phone and google was kind of like, uh, right? Okay
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:08.820]   Yeah, that was my first nexus. You did I was at the event so I got it
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.380]   And I was like it was the first phone event I ever covered
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:15.220]   Oh, why I happened I happened to be in san francisco
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:19.860]   And again chip reporter wireless spectrum reporter
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:26.180]   Not the actual device reporter and they were like almost like I don't want to go you go and I was like
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:32.740]   Okay, I was so nervous. I was just like, I don't know how to do device coverage
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.740]   I don't know what to write about it. I don't know what to do
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.020]   Open the box. Stacy. That's all I got to do is open the box
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.020]   Nixes nobody happened
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:44.100]   Exactly. That's kind of how I felt. What did you think?
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.620]   What was your impression of the nexus one with a little rolly ball at the bottom?
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.180]   Dude, I don't even remember
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.740]   That was an impression
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.740]   I mean
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:59.380]   Yeah, I'm like I can't I can't even remember my first like non
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.340]   My first non-screen phone
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:08.420]   I'm like there was a blackberry pearl in there and beyond that and I had a motor razor at one time but beyond that no
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:11.140]   Oh the motor roller razor
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.780]   Wow, I think we've got a segue
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.100]   motor roller
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:20.580]   Just put out a tease for an upcoming phone reveal November 13th
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:25.380]   And they had a little animation is doing this little foldy thing
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:30.500]   They put throughout all sorts of little key key points in the invitation
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:35.140]   Saying a highly anticipated unveiling of a reinvented icon
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:39.940]   You're going to flip an original unlike any other
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.380]   and pretty certain this is motor all is foldable take of the
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:50.180]   Motorola razor the original razor the flip razor that everybody had
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:55.300]   Yay, so I and I never had one. I never actually had a
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:01.780]   Motorola razor, but I did I did want one. That was the very first phone. I bought Queen Pruitt
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.580]   Was it? Oh wow, very she liked that one
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:10.740]   She she loved it until everybody started getting into the smartphones and they were texting fasted in her
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:13.060]   Yes, I'm seeing this on air
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:20.660]   I just remember it was really satisfying to hang on hanging up on people that way
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:26.260]   So when when was the razor how long what year was that?
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:29.940]   What was that it's got to be 2003 2004
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.740]   Oh four is oh it says so first release November 2005
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.700]   I know that's wrong
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:43.700]   That might be right. I was thinking about oh four something like that might be right actually it might actually be 2005
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:47.140]   Wow
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:51.140]   Oh no the the v3 was the first
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:56.900]   Yeah, the v3 was the first one and it was introduced in july of 2004
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:03.940]   But then the v3 I with itunes built in oh, I forgot about that. Yeah
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.020]   I too is on a Motorola phone
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:15.460]   Yeah, and I also remember a lot of people like like it was such a hot phone
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:19.460]   Everybody wanted one of those things and then at some point I started noticing
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:27.140]   There were these little air vents near the displays that when you would have the phone in your pocket little pocket fuzz would get in there
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:31.220]   And it would line the inside display and everything and there was
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:34.500]   The luster started to kind of wear off a little bit
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:36.900]   With that so
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.900]   Hopefully mo to rolla has has taken care of those issues for the new upcoming Motorola
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:48.180]   foldable razor, but any interest I'm old enough that anything this century seems recent to me
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.980]   That's fair
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.540]   That's still with that new phone by mo to rolla. Yeah 2005. Oh, yeah, that was yesterday
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:33:02.500]   So if you want to put it in context, I always realized this but like when I had my daughter
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.220]   It was 2006
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:06.100]   and
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:12.660]   There were like no smart phones because I remember being like I you know, I was nursing so I I had nothing
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.780]   I didn't have a Kindle. I had to like I had nothing right and then
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:24.340]   2007 was the first iPhone so like so soon after that people were just like why do you say you were bored?
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.740]   It's the best time when I'm nursing. I can just like you know scroll through my face
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:36.500]   And my daughter just turned 13 so the world has changed a lot really quickly. Yeah, it really has
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.740]   It really has
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.420]   Your daughter's phone might someday be a large format foldable like the Huawei Mate X
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:50.740]   That uh has been delayed and delayed similar to the Samsung fold dude
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:54.180]   She's gonna have earbuds that just talk to some sort of
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:57.540]   Something embedded in her head. Oh, no
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:02.020]   I'm almost to the point where I'm ready for that. You're ready for that
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:08.260]   I'm almost to the point because some things are just annoying me day-to-day with with phones and tech and
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.660]   security and
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.780]   You know, we need this many levels of ID and with us in our pockets and come on
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:16.820]   Just give me a chip
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:22.500]   But if we have this technology inside of us then security affects us like directly right
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:27.540]   Yeah, there's always a caveat as they say in the White House get over it. Yeah pretty much
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:33.060]   They know I'm like you can put a chip in my dog and I can find him and he's happy
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:35.460]   You know he can pass for anything
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:38.340]   Just give me a chip too
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:42.980]   That's what you need for your liquor cabinet. Stay safe. You just need chips
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.260]   Just ship your daughter and
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.260]   Have ship your daughter
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:56.180]   Next that's that's next so Kevin just hopped on the chat and says the host need to check something
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:01.860]   But I don't know what he's asking. Yeah, he put a link up on about Chromebooks where you can now

[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:26.900]   I don't know. I gotta check this out. I will say there have been times if I was writing a query or what have you and I had
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:30.420]   I'd copy some a line of that query and paste it down somewhere else
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:38.020]   Yeah, that's the most simple pace pace pace, but after that last time I was done, you know, but you just want it out of your memory
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.460]   Yeah, that's it. I move on a right to be forgotten. Yes that
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:45.540]   Even though no one will ever forget me
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.580]   You're unforgettable. That's right in many ways
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:57.060]   Sing it
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:00.100]   Maps
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.100]   Maps is getting even more ways like
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:06.260]   In its incident report feature
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:12.260]   Basically new categories are being added before it was just crashes speed traps and traffic slowdowns
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:16.340]   Now they're also going to include construction sites lane closures
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:20.340]   disabled vehicles and objects blocking the road
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:27.780]   I gotta tell you the previous update with the landmarks. I finally got a hold of that in that's awesome
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:30.420]   You know telling you turn right on
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.980]   D street at
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:39.140]   At the salon. Yeah, you know that I was like, oh, I see it. You know, that's cool. That was awesome
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:44.020]   Yeah, and I haven't really noticed that feature. That was awesome. Is that because you hear it reading it to you?
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:50.740]   Yeah, it says it out loud. Okay, I keep my view on so you know, I'm muted. So that's probably why oh, yeah, I never want to listen to the person
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:58.500]   Uh also announced today at the android dev summit is the release of android studio 4.0
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.020]   This includes
[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:04.660]   If you need really anticipated early developer preview of jetpack compose
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:10.180]   Which promises a way to create modern ui with kotlin similar to what devs
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:15.620]   Have encountered with google's flutter developers are very excited about this. So I only
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:20.020]   Somewhat understand but if you want a better understanding of this actually last night
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:25.060]   We had a couple of uh guests on all about android from google
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:31.380]   We had a nick butcher and florina muntinescu who are both android developer advocates
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.700]   And they are actually speaking on these topics at the end of summit
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:41.300]   Uh today and tomorrow so check out yesterday's all about android and you can find out more about some of this stuff
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.340]   Some of these announcements obviously they made today. So they were talking
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:49.860]   Around them last night of course but uh touching on on the the concepts and everything so
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:56.020]   Um, if you are so excited about the upcoming movie frozen to
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:58.340]   Oh, I am too
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.220]   And you'll be happy to know that your google home
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:07.380]   Will read uh read the story along with you when you get the golden book for frozen too
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.380]   Yeah, I was excited about that until I realized I had to have the golden book and they're like
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:15.620]   The golden books are awesome. Yeah
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:21.060]   They are awesome, but my child is you know 13 now and a little embarrassing to go buy it
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:27.700]   Oh, it is not embarrassing. I have perfect multiple copies. There is a monster at the end of this book. Oh
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:32.340]   My favorite
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.740]   Oh my
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.580]   And any old
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:40.020]   What was great? I one time uh years ago. I went home to visit
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:42.500]   Uh, and I fat
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:46.660]   Yeah, my mom showed me this like stash of books from when I was a kid and that was in there was a
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:53.220]   Oh, and I brought it and it's it's my kids love it as well. So that's a book that never never gets old
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:56.900]   I saw a song what a great book that why isn't that here?
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:01.540]   I want to hear what google would do with that one. So there's actually there was an app version of it
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.140]   We had it for my
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.700]   Well, it was it must have been my daughter and it was on the ipad
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.260]   um, and it was
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:11.780]   I don't know if it was better than my crazy grover voice, but she did
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:17.300]   Grover voice is fun
[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:24.980]   Finally google is rolling out nest hello chimes to tie into the season. I'll uh halloween for now
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:28.660]   I'm sure once christmas rolls around maybe there will be some hoho hos going on
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.220]   But for now it's spooky sounds so you get a
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:36.420]   Followed by witches laughing or monsters growling or if that's sort of thing
[01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:43.300]   Should I ask my google speaker to get spooky as people keep suggesting in the chat room? Uh, please
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.460]   Sure. Yes
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:48.340]   All right, hold on. Let me tap the mic off here
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:52.740]   That's like something else
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:58.100]   Come here google we have google get spooky
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:01.940]   Hey google get spooky

[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:34.100]   We get to take down notice
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:39.220]   It's a good question. We get a take down notice with that. Oh, it's still playing
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:41.780]   Oh, is it?
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:45.300]   That's the song that's the song I hear every time I say I go to the bathroom
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:50.980]   TMI
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:53.060]   I was like we could set that up so it plays that
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.820]   Yeah, when you flash
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:00.820]   And that is the google change law
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:06.820]   Oh, what would the right music be for toilet? I don't know but I want to go there now
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:10.020]   Jeff, why would you ask questions?
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:12.340]   Nope
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:16.660]   Gotta be a good answer to that question though. There has to be I appreciate that you asked it
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:21.300]   And I think it deserves some thought the chat room I'm sure will have a few suggestions

[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:59.140]   It's true every pothole every rabbit hole every rat hole you somehow managed
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:04.820]   Somethin i like it to make it to the end. Yeah, uh, i'm sure we've missed something
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:11.540]   We missed what we missed was that people are having fits about well google gave me free storage all this time another charge me for storage
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.540]   Oh, right the bloomberg article
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.540]   That i had someone pointed out that's exactly what the entire news industry did but
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:23.540]   Okay, it's also a popular tactic with drug dealers right to get you hooked
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:29.060]   To get you hooked and then 15 years later they start charging for it
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:38.340]   But so i will say because i actually i wasn't worried about charging because i but i did go delete my emails from like
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.900]   2005 all the way through
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:44.260]   2010 i think no did you?
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:48.500]   2009 i stopped to 2009 did you archive those before
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.780]   Heck no i just deleted your life care later. I don't care. I don't want to walk down memory lane
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:59.700]   Yeah, i'll probably go back to 2010 and anything prior to that because it's pointless
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:04.180]   But i freed up probably three or four gigs of memory easily
[01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:07.060]   I mean there's no need there's uh
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:12.020]   I find things in search that can i mean especially what happens to your memory like an old man like me
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:16.340]   I see that i met that person back in all nine
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:22.260]   Yeah, right was that right i'm kind of like if i met you in 2005
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:25.140]   Can i really claim some sort of kinship on you? No
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:32.180]   We met back in 2005 you don't remember i don't remember but my emails does it happen
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:40.900]   Now if i'm in gmail, how can i find out where my more my storage is?
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:45.540]   It used to be in the bottom left used to be at the bottom left, but i don't think it's there anymore
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:47.860]   i'll tell you that goes
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:50.420]   That gum it indeed
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:53.700]   Yeah, i'm not finding i don't see it online either i want to know because i haven't
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:56.980]   I haven't reached the point
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:02.580]   Well, i'll be no one used to be right there on the front page you couldn't miss it now
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:05.940]   They don't want you to know they just want to spring the the message for you
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.580]   uh when you when you're about to go over
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:13.060]   Apparently they don't make it easy for you to find or maybe it's somewhere else
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.740]   um
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:16.740]   Yeah, i i have a hard time
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:20.580]   Uh thinking about deleting old emails
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:26.500]   I kind of like don't think about it just do i'm the same way but i've gotten to a point now
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.940]   it's like
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:30.820]   What am i going to do with this you know 20 years
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:36.260]   From now, it's it's not even useful now. It's probably not going to be useful another five years from now
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.420]   So just go ahead and just cut it off get it out of my head
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:42.020]   You know, and i've there's certain things like documents or whatever
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:46.340]   Yeah, i'll keep that but just random messages now they can go
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:51.460]   They can go especially if i don't hear from these people regularly and nothing
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:54.020]   But every once in a while
[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:59.780]   I end up doing a search for some random thing and then i look through the results and i see that there's something in there from like
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.980]   2000
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:01.780]   I don't know
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:03.780]   This is a very
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.540]   Remember that email and i actually do remember writing that email in my search for whatever reason
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:12.980]   That's why i said about 2010 because i've done some searches like that too where i'm just looking for something in particular
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:19.380]   But it i guess metadata has it connected somehow, okay, and it pulls up something from like 2010 i'm like, oh, yeah
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:23.780]   I did write that so i but i'll keep it but anything beyond that now right
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:28.820]   I think i think it's a function of the type of person you are like
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:36.980]   I don't keep i don't keep anything i have like i'm like, eh i don't care get rid of it. That's my wife. She can't keep anything
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:42.500]   My husband everything has to have a container i swear i'm gonna be buried in rubbermaid
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:48.340]   I just throw it out. I'm just like it's not useful when we got engaged
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:53.780]   He popped a bottle of champagne at the site where we got engaged and then he handed me the cork afterwards
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:56.500]   And i stared at it i was like do you want to throw this out?
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:01.540]   Right, no, it's a memento and i was like, oh, honey. This is trash
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:07.220]   So yeah
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:15.140]   This on the show before but when i met my wife she was unimpressed by discovery that kitchen cabinets were the exact right size to store copies of the new york times
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:19.700]   I would have shot you jeff have a way patient right
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:25.220]   No, she wasn't very patient they were gone quickly
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:32.660]   By the way, you can log into dry i knew i could see this somewhere and thank you i believe bleak put it in the chat room
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.860]   Log just log into drive.google.com and you'll see in the bottom left hand corner you'll see your storage
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.740]   Right now i'm sitting at 42.7 gigs of 115 so i'm doing okay
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.620]   Oh, that's oh, okay
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.580]   but i
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:50.660]   47 gigs, huh
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:52.740]   I've got 42 of 232
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:55.780]   Okay, where are you at?
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.380]   Yeah, i'm at one point something terabytes of
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:04.820]   Yeah about that
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.340]   Are you sending
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:12.020]   Photos i have some photos out there but not all of my photos but i have some photos out there that i've kept
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:19.380]   Um because of the pixel automatic backup thing some of them some of them i did keep out there not granted i still pulled them down
[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:23.940]   Elsewhere but who that's that's a lot of data and
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.740]   Yeah, it is a lot
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.060]   It's probably like a tree that burns every day
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:32.980]   What do you have Stacy 90 kb?
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:35.780]   Right, oh you're gonna love it. It's seven gigabytes
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:40.580]   Wow, wow bravo
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:45.220]   So that's the way you do it. There you go. This is
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.260]   I want to be like Stacy wanted these days one of these days
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:58.340]   I feel like I know each and every one of you just a little bit more now that I know how much of your your space your drive space is taken up right now
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:04.660]   Uh, what else has got to be anything else in here before we get to
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:07.060]   I was on a port one to get to all right. That was a good
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.740]   All right, none of us really paid attention to mark Zuckerberg
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:19.700]   In congress. I do have a funny. I I put it in the in the chat. I don't know if there's a funny video of Zuckerberg's reaction when he's compared to trump
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:22.180]   Oh, no really
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:27.300]   So I don't know i've incarced none of you if you queued it up past the commercial
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:33.780]   He says hold on and this is from today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:40.340]   It can't find it's a two-parter. You gotta see the two parts. Okay. Everybody should look for that
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:43.700]   I think Carson's having a hard time finding it. Okay, that's fine. That's all good
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:49.460]   Uh, but you can look for that if that tickles your fancy or whatever that saying is
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:56.100]   Okay, well then why don't we get into tips picks numbers all that kind of stuff
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.860]   Uh
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.580]   And you are in studio right now sitting right next to me something going to you first what you got
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:06.580]   This time I did not have a thing that I've you know
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:12.980]   Popped in my head or what have you because of something I come across during my musings of this here internets
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:15.460]   um, but
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:22.340]   I did want to give a shout out to our triangulation show. Uh, these lies two have just been
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.980]   Fascinating, especially this one here with miss ruha Benjamin
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:31.060]   And she's talking about her book race after technology
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:36.580]   And it really really struck a nerve when we you know we can go back about a month or so
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:42.420]   Where we were looking at ai and how it just falsely identified me as a wrongdoer
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:44.660]   in all of that jazz
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:51.620]   Um, but her book is sounding great. I started reading it a couple of weeks ago and it it really does open your eyes
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:52.740]   Um
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:54.980]   From all different perspectives that she breaks down
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:58.340]   What's going into all of this technology and what people are?
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:04.020]   Uh, our feeling when they're subjected to some of these technologies even like
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:08.420]   When they didn't even ask to be subjected to these technologies think of the homeless folks
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:10.660]   Right that were used as part of the tools
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:14.260]   Um, but that episode and then the episode prior to that
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:15.940]   um
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:21.940]   Mr. Micah sergeant interviewed. I can't remember her name now, but she was she was talking about waste and garbage
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.220]   and
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.180]   Kate o' kneel
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.660]   Kate o' kneel and i'm sitting here in
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:33.460]   In petaluma living here now and i've been battling with recycling and recycling the right way and
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:38.100]   They're fussing at me and telling me i'm not recycling right and the whole thing
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:46.580]   I had no idea how much went into it, but mrs. Kate o' kneel discussed a lot more in depth and how a lot of this stuff
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:51.860]   Especially with amazon. We love getting our packages. Yeah, but they are the worst offenders
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.300]   When it comes to handling and recycling
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.300]   Um, the protest that we get it's it's those two shows
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:05.380]   Triangulation i've already been a big fan of it, but those two shows right they have really hit me in the heart recently
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:10.740]   Number one because i'm living here and experiencing the number two that whole ai thing is still a mess
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:12.980]   It's got a waste to go
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:19.940]   It's awesome twit.tv/tri or twit.tv/ I think triangulation works as well
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:26.900]   Uh, yeah, we're all pitching in on triangulation. Yep, like it's done. I'll be in there soon. I'll be in there soon
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:31.700]   Awesome. I've got an interview with um with jerry
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:37.380]   Uh, why am I suddenly blanking? That was where else was thank you jerry elswith for this friday
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:41.700]   Uh, which is a great interview that we recorded on monday about her
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:47.380]   Project tilt five which is an aug matter reality kind of tabletop board game
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:52.100]   Thing that's really neat. Oh, it was a great interview. So that's gonna be this friday as well
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:57.620]   So yeah, it's a great show. It's awesome to be able to have the opportunity to just talk with people
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:02.660]   Yeah, things that they focus on their passions all that kind of stuff. They're so freaking smart. Yes
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:05.140]   They're smart indeed
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:07.060]   Stacy, what's your thing?
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:08.180]   I
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:14.660]   Have a service because i'm crazy. I've been trying out the nike training club premium
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:20.020]   and if you if you're gonna guess i am gonna try the fit bit premium next because
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:23.060]   Because i'm crazy
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:28.020]   Exactly. Um, so this is I think it's 1599 a month
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:36.020]   Um, I I think i've recommended the nike training club app before if I haven't I tell random people about it because it is like
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:39.860]   Wonderful for people who travel because i have lots of bodyweight exercises
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.020]   um
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.020]   And i'm just going to warn you though
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:47.620]   Nike premium is not for
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:53.940]   Casual people wimps. I would say it's not even for casual people
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:59.460]   So I have historically found that i'm a i'm a fairly fit person
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:04.420]   I'm not like running marathons, but I I do keep active and etc, right
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:08.900]   The nike anything above beginner or intermediate
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:16.660]   So the advanced workouts, I I can't even do them like it's sometimes very discouraging when you're like they're like
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:19.700]   Here's the warm up and you're like, yeah, i'm dead now
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:25.700]   Exercise I currently can handle. I don't know what's happening to my body
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:29.700]   but they have like
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:36.260]   The the classes they have added with premium are really awesome. Um, I do find it
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:42.020]   Motivational in a way like if you're going to do peloton if you're going to spend three thousand dollars on a mirror
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:46.260]   Then this is not for you, but if you just want like a quick and easy
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:49.140]   Way to work out
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:53.540]   You can start with the free app which has plenty of great workouts, but if you want to do like a program or something
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:04:00.020]   They're actually quite motivational. I've tried two of their programs and I I like both of them and they're
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:06.260]   A huge variety of bodyweight ones and then there's a huge variety of ones that are like 30 minutes or less
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:08.580]   so
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:10.580]   a nice so that's so
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:17.780]   Yeah, if you're if you've never exercised before this may not be the best one for you
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:22.100]   But if you want to challenge yourself, this is a very challenging
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:27.380]   Way to go. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great because that was going to be my next question
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:30.660]   Could anybody just pick this up and give it a go?
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:35.300]   But you you don't think the beginner should grab this just yet
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.020]   I feel like if you are a true beginner
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:42.500]   Unless you're like a true beginner you're like 20 in your 20s. Maybe you could do it
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:47.060]   But like if you were older than that, I feel like you could probably get hurt. Okay. Yeah
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:51.780]   Just real talk fair enough fair enough. Yeah
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:57.300]   Nike training club premium right on uh jeff what's your number?
[02:04:57.300 --> 02:05:00.100]   so I could do
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:01.460]   To go down a rabbit hole
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:08.580]   I could do the fact that the pop eyes chicken sandwich is coming back and pop eyes with 150 stores is hiring 400 extra people
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:14.660]   To handle it, but i'm not going to do that one good job pop eyes. You just create it more jobs nice work
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:19.300]   That's good. That's good. By the way, have you all had this did you all have the sandwich? What was out no negative?
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:25.540]   I was so sad. I love the good. Just very good. Very good. Very good. The pickles were a nice touch
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:28.180]   There we go
[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:30.180]   I'm from chick fillet country. So i'm like
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:36.500]   Well, I I endorsed what happened in the UK to chick fillet. Yeah, um, you've heard about that, right?
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:40.180]   No, I know that they opened they opened a store within a week
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:43.380]   It's closed because the protests against chick fillet in the UK
[02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:52.900]   But the number we're gonna do is this and the number we're gonna do is this is there was a study of 40 million trips on uber to find out what people's tips are
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:59.860]   And I don't know about you, but I tip every time and I was upset when uber didn't have tips and now it has tips
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.620]   That has for a long time
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.020]   60% of writers never tip
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:06.980]   That's baloney really
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:13.060]   1% always tip those who tip leave an average of $3 this we're washing in post story about the study
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:15.780]   um
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:19.860]   And somebody pointed out they don't they don't know what happens offline if you give cash that's not included
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:21.860]   But I can't imagine there's a lot of that
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:24.100]   um
[02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:26.740]   If you know who the writer is you can guess the tip
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:33.780]   Regardless of trip or driver quality in other words tipping is determined by the writer and not the driver which I guess that's good news
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:35.380]   um
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:42.500]   Women tip 14 through percent 14.3 percent of the time men tip 17 percent of the time that surprised the heck out of me
[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:46.820]   One guess is because women may feel that they're not treated very well in uber's. I don't know
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:49.860]   um
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:56.100]   Men tip 12 more if their driver is a woman, which may be good or maybe bad. I don't know
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.900]   Unbelievable
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:03.220]   The premium men pay to women behind the wheel shrinks as the women get older
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:05.540]   Well, that answers the question as to whether that's good or bad
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.300]   That's bad
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.580]   By the time the drivers reach 865 it is virtually vanished
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:16.740]   Women also tip other women more but they don't specifically change their tips based on the driver's age
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:19.620]   Women always being nicer than men
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:21.940]   um
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:26.260]   So that's I found that all pretty darned fascinate
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:32.020]   Wow and sad that's not pressing. I always did barely scraping a living
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:38.420]   Well, you know what I found out I talked to someone close to me and I will not out them because you know
[02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:44.100]   This is a terrible thing. They don't tip in hotels. Oh boy. Oh boy
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:48.020]   And I was like you don't tip your housekeepers. They're like no one does that anymore and I was like
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:54.100]   Uh, they should and yes, they do so do you guys tip in hotels? I do I do
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:58.740]   I do now. I will I will confess that I had stopped a bit my wife. Um
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:01.940]   Shame me
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:09.700]   She's right. You should you should be tipping those people work super hard. They have everything against them. Sorry. Yes, exactly
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:12.500]   I do I do every time
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:14.500]   This is now public but
[02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:16.820]   Many years ago back in
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:18.420]   2001
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:20.900]   I lived in a hotel here and there
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:23.700]   when I wasn't living in my car
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:25.060]   and
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.500]   When I would get a hotel room, I would go to a little inexpensive hotel because it was all that I could afford at the time
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:36.820]   And I could remember befriending the housekeepers there and seeing what they dealt with
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:41.060]   Yeah, tipping. Yes tipping those folks. Yeah. Yeah
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:44.020]   I I'm like
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:47.140]   I'm battling little little bouts of shame right now
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:51.700]   That's not that's not a habit that I've had in my life. But
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:59.700]   You know, it's I I'm like a shame to admit I'd never it's never a curtling. No, it's never crossed my mind. And that's that's fine
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:06.660]   That's that's that's ignorant. That's not stupid. Yeah, it's just never crossed my mind. Yeah, okay
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:12.340]   And they make minimum wage and yes, there are people who say they should be paid more and I'm 100% with you
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:16.420]   But they are not paid more sometimes they are paid only by the number of rooms they have to be
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:22.660]   And in a lot of cases they're immigrants who don't have a lot of power and are taken advantage of in
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:26.660]   Sexually assaulted. They also the hotels now do these things. Sorry. Sorry. Stacey. Yeah
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:29.060]   No, there's no these things
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:33.620]   They pay them by the room, but they're in sending their customers to not get right cleaning
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:38.420]   You got extra points or you're gonna discount if you don't get clean. Well, no, I'm not gonna put them out of work that way
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.740]   All right, I'm paying for the hotel. You're gonna pay them hotel and I'll pay them too a little. Yep
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:47.940]   Right. I'll give them gratuity. I always leave something on the counters before I leave always do
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:53.300]   How do they know that that money is for them and not just money you left out you checked out
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.060]   You check out when you check out. Okay. Well, you should leave it every day
[02:09:57.060 --> 02:09:59.220]   Like I'm so bullish on this right now like
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:07.460]   Basically every day when you check out I do it every day and then I write a note like I there's usually a note pad in your hotel
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:10.580]   And I just you know, thank you for cleaning
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:13.940]   Okay
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:19.620]   Or I thought they get scared that they were going to be accused of stealing right money out before
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:22.500]   You try I mean ideally you will leave a note
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:26.900]   Um or yes, if you're if you're not really obvious they will not take it
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:30.580]   Um, because I have left it out not been and I'm like, oh, there's my five dollars
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:31.220]   Yeah, that's the thing
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:36.500]   I've lifted out in the past two and they didn't take it so I've always just waited until check out time and stick it
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.500]   I do it to the station there
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:44.420]   But people clean every different people clean every day in some hotels so then I mean, it's not terrible
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:49.380]   But yeah, oh, you don't wait wait. I said let me let's go through the litter
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:54.100]   I do not tip at gas stations. Well, we have full service. You don't
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:11:01.140]   Say your jersey your jersey. We're not allowed to pump our own. Oh, okay. You ever know I don't
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:03.940]   Yeah, are there any others?
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:07.140]   Like where you tip the people who wash my dog
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:11.140]   What about what about when you call for like takeout?
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:16.740]   Oh, yeah, because you're not because not like a service sort of thing I tip
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:22.820]   Takeout I tip they get tips too because they have to they have to package the food up for you
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:27.460]   Yeah, which is yeah, they're poorly paid. I don't tend to do 20 percent right right?
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:34.180]   Yes, that's kind of where I'm out with takeout as well. Yeah, uh, but yes, I tip there. Okay. Yeah. This is interesting
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.660]   This is fascinating
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:39.060]   Totally learned something about hotels but the uber thing
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:44.820]   You know, I think when uber started by not allowing tip by not having tips part of the app right and lift change that
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:50.660]   It's set a precedent in people's minds. I can't imagine that they would go out of a yellow cab and not tip
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:54.100]   Oh people don't tip a lot. Yeah
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:58.500]   Um ask anybody in the service industry. They will tell you that um
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:03.060]   There are surprising numbers of people in that some people that only tip like
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.060]   5%
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:07.860]   And they feel good about it. I'm not even that yeah, I've seen that
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:13.300]   That's not even the I didn't even enjoy your service tip. That's the you were good
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:17.700]   I'll give you 5% that's good enough for you. Mm-hmm. Yeah
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:22.580]   So so the other thing I do is if I go out now and I split you know, we put on multiple cards
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:27.220]   I think there's a kind of ack moment when you're checking
[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:30.260]   Oh
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:34.340]   If you have more than six people they'll add it automatically in most restaurants
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:36.900]   But if it's just let's say two couples
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:43.380]   Right or two or two colleagues around all right put down multiple cards then I kind of want to make sure that it's enough
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:50.100]   I see what you're saying. I don't want to shame the other person either if they see what i'm leaving. All right, sometimes I just like
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:56.900]   I'll I'll just say out loud. I'll be like, you know, like I'm like, okay. I'm gonna put like five dollars down for my you know
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.300]   Right on top of this and then they can
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:02.340]   That's either shaming or not shaming or right?
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:07.460]   However, they want to handle or 20 percent. Yeah, I normally just write it out whatever it is
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.980]   I don't even tell the other people and I just assume it's going to be okay
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:15.860]   You know, this is not tipping but a front colleague of mine at school. This is really interesting. I had never thought of this
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:20.420]   She's vowed. I think it's once a week even once a month once a week she
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:26.820]   puts upside and she's not paid a lot from her public university puts a side $10 for a homeless person
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:32.420]   Yeah, and he used to be the her rationale wasn't she'd kind of add a dollar here dollar there would add up to dollars
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:37.700]   But she realized she thought to actually pick someone to give them $10 was a little more
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:43.780]   It doesn't change their life, but it just more gratifying useful. Yeah, which is interesting philosophy. I hadn't thought of
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:48.340]   I we do 10 percent of our income to
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:52.980]   Cherry, possibly. Wow. We died. Yeah
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:56.980]   I mean, it's it's but I don't I do not
[02:13:56.980 --> 02:14:00.180]   typically give to people on the streets
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:05.780]   Like I give two organizations, but I tend to be the same, but there are cases
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:10.580]   Yeah, there's I was like there are days that that happens. All right
[02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:16.180]   Not often, you know what happens to me is I'll end up walking past about 10 steps and say
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:21.300]   I'm busy. I can afford this and I walk back. Mm-hmm. You know, I'm not very often but I do that
[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:25.060]   There's one guy who got me though. Okay more of a scammer. He's guy
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.860]   white guy dressed up suit and can raise spare $3
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:34.980]   You think it's gonna be oh because he just needs three dollars to just get enough for the bus ride. Okay, you know, right?
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:40.660]   All right, then the next day he's there the next day he's there the next day he's there. That's this that's a stick
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:46.900]   So he's the greedy pant handler, right? Yeah, I don't know. Is it greedy or is it just it fooled you? I mean like
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:48.580]   full knee, but
[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.340]   there
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:54.500]   I mean like some people they're like, yeah, they're only gonna buy alcohol with the money you give them. I'm like
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:59.060]   Yeah, but you know, I have the whole I lived on the street to or right. Yeah, something like this. That's right
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:01.380]   Or if you find
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:03.380]   Something that gets you extra money
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:05.220]   then
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:09.940]   Again, this is why I don't give it to on the street though because it's really complicated. It is very
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:13.540]   But if you have a kid with you, I'm probably gonna be like
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:16.740]   Yeah
[02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:19.700]   Yeah, I remember when I was a kid driving through New York with my parents
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:22.900]   You know the first time when they would come up knock on the window and you know
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:28.500]   We were privileged kids in the suburbs. We didn't know all right. Yeah. Yep
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.180]   Well
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:35.220]   Thanks, mr. Jarvis
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:38.980]   That went a whole bunch of directions right there
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:46.260]   This is twig where we really do talk about anything. We'll show mr. La Porte to go on vacation
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:52.340]   I I feel like my my tool is so insignificant compared to what we just talked about
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:56.340]   Look at some apps that are designed really well
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:03.700]   I don't let me give you all of the camera space here. You showed that app
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.340]   Well, we don't need to really show it each and every app
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:13.060]   But basically the material design 2019 awards were last week and four apps were called out specifically by google
[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:18.980]   And I I do have them all installed. We don't have to look at all of them or anything
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:21.220]   but I actually showed one of them on
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:25.940]   All about android last night called reflect the this one won for
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:32.260]   What was it for innovation which they said were new directions and material in the material design system
[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:37.140]   You know things like lots of little animations swooping around there's the statistics page
[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:42.980]   When you're moving around you get this nice little haptic tick that happens that just feels really satisfying
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.340]   Another app that they called out was scripts
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:50.260]   Which they say has a a good experience an impactful
[02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:53.540]   User experience, so this is actually kind of a language
[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:55.620]   learning app
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:59.460]   But all these apps just kind of have a very unique design
[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:03.300]   Language, so if if design is your your thing
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:09.860]   You should definitely check out this list and and take a look at them because they're really they're really well done
[02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:13.620]   This one's I guess what is this teaching you? This is teaching me
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:16.820]   Hara Hiragana
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:18.820]   It's a teaching me how to
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:26.260]   Do Japanese how to do Japanese? Okay. I was like I don't know what's happening here, but yeah, okay
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:30.020]   I'm just talking through it. Yep. See too. There's the swipe
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:33.060]   And I'm just learning the action
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:39.540]   Learning the right the letter a looks yeah the learning to write the letter a and now they're easier so
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:46.980]   Uh, maybe my muscle memory kicks in and I know how to do it. I know the letter a I dig that
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:52.980]   Yeah, and that's just two of the apps a few of the other ones trip.com and rough
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:58.580]   one for theming and one for universality kind of a thoughtful and inclusive design
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:04.500]   I just thought it was a a cool small selection of apps that maybe you've heard of maybe you haven't but if designs your thing
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.700]   You can check it out and see them for yourself
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:12.260]   I'm glad I'm checking out rough right now because I think it has something to do with dogs
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:14.180]   Yes
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.180]   It does
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:22.820]   Load it up. Let's see here fetching. We call those actually I think it's just the logo. This is like a text editor
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:28.980]   There you go. There's rough
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:32.420]   Did you see wait a second did you see the Bissell bark bath?
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:36.660]   The Bissell bark bath as in the vacuum people
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:39.060]   You back you look at dog
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:41.060]   Look it up
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:46.340]   Bark bath see if it goes up. Yep Bissell bark bath. Oh wow
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:48.340]   Oh
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:54.260]   It's so it has there's gonna be a video there somewhere
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:19:01.380]   So it has like a clean and dirty tank and you scrape your dog with it and it's like it's like a carpet cleaner for your dog
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:07.220]   That is exactly where it's picturing when you said Bissell. Yeah, it's what it is right there. You see yep
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:10.340]   And of course the dog is showing loving this I know
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:15.940]   Let me terrorize you with this
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:25.140]   Exactly, you know, I think you're definitely afraid of it's coming towards you. Yes wet. Yes
