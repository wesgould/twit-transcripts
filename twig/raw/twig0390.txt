[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Stacey's here, Jeff's here.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.320]   We're gonna gather and talk about the latest news.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.220]   Google results are in, Facebook results are in.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.160]   We'll contrast that as to Microsoft and Apple's results.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.480]   And we'll talk about lots of cool new things,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.560]   including a very scary robot and a very cute one.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.800]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.960]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.720]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.800]   >> From people you trust.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.240]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.720]   >> This is Twig.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.760]   >> Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.240]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.760]   Hi, this is Leo LePort and once again time for Twig's audience survey,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.120]   we'd really like to hear from you.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.160]   It's only gonna take a couple of minutes really, that's all.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.320]   Just go to twit.tv/survey and let us know what you think.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.720]   Your anonymous feedback will help us make Twig even better.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.240]   And thanks for your continued support.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.760]   This is Twig.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.160]   This week in Google, episode 390, recorded Wednesday, February 1, 2017.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.400]   Bacon shortage.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680]   This week in Google is brought to you by Curry, a real live robot with a great personality.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.440]   Curry is available for pre-order now at haycurry.com.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.800]   That's H-E-Y K-U-R-I dot com.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.320]   This week in Google to show where we cover whatever the hell we want.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.920]   But we attempt, we're a will attempt today to cover Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.200]   maddening crowd.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.000]   With us, the king of the maddening crowd is to Jeff, I resist Jarvis.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.400]   >> Well, my crown.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.280]   >> Hey, great to see you at home and everything.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   >> You recovered from Davos?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.760]   >> Yeah, I did, I did.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.960]   And then I didn't go to Tokyo, so I'm probably kind of recovered.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.080]   And then I'm in town for a few weeks.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   I don't know what to do.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.240]   My wife's going to commit Harry Curry.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.800]   >> I'm going to be bored in the real world.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.880]   >> Also with us from Austin, Texas.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.160]   Stacey, here can buy them a VOT podcast.com.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.080]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   I was thinking about you, Stacey, because I'm seeing more and more articles about ransomware
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.240]   and how it's getting more aggressive targeting operating systems.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   And I'm thinking targeting soon IOT devices.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.640]   >> That is one of my big trends of 2017 is ransomware.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   >> See?
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   >> Yes.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   >> There was the hotel issue in Austria.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   >> In Austria, yes.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.240]   >> Which I misreported, because I read somebody's news report that said people were locked into
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.280]   their rooms as well as locked out by ransomware only locked out.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.720]   >> Well, they locked out.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.160]   >> Well, actually, it wasn't they weren't locked out or locked in.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   >> Keys didn't work.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.400]   >> They just couldn't issue keys.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   >> Right.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.160]   Oh, and existing keys would continue to work or not?
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.120]   >> I believe that's true.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.040]   The Verge actually did a good job.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.520]   >> Yeah, there was a lot of fake news around that.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160]   Although I hate to use that phrase, but-
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   >> It's not.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   >> There was errors.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   >> There were error reporting errors.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.920]   But I loved the statement from the manager, though, apparently this hotel in Austria, which
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   is over 100 years old, has been hacked multiple times in the last few months.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.120]   And he finally said, that's it.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.240]   I give up, we're getting mechanical keys for the door locks.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.480]   Back to the key with a big tassel.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   And that's one of the things I like about the old European hotels.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.120]   As you leave, you leave it with a clerk, and when you get back, you say, I'm in [FOREIGN]
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   and they give you the key with a tassel and you go upstairs.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.440]   I like that.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.920]   And you can't get locked out by ransomware.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.480]   But this is an example of as we increasingly use digital technology in our lives, that
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.080]   opens the door to malefactors.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.640]   >> Yes, but those keys, you could also get copies of them made.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.680]   And then you could see if someone's in their room or not.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   I mean, there's, I don't know how many times that I've been reading a book.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.200]   >> I mean, I just can't do it from Lithuania.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   >> So the interesting thing to me was, I felt like the ransom was relatively low.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> They're smart, of course it is.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.600]   >> Right, two Bitcoins, so like $1,800.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.760]   >> Is that all just two Bitcoins?
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.960]   >> I think two, oh no, half a Bitcoin.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   Was it half a Bitcoin?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   >> What?
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.800]   >> How much is Bitcoin going right now?
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.600]   >> It's about $938.22.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.520]   >> Okay, two Bitcoins, two Bitcoins.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   And basically, I can see this sort of thing happening all over town, like when you think
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.680]   about like someone hacking into like some nest credentials, for example.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.480]   You want to turn your thermostat on?
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   Quick, pay this.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.680]   >> Yeah, and the key is you make it low enough that people go, well, it's easier to pay
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.840]   them than it is to try to fix this.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.440]   >> Yeah, you make it up in volume, Jeff.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   >> Like they say in the Shmodah District.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.240]   >> Yeah, micro payments for ransom.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.120]   >> Yeah, the pressing is it?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.520]   >> You throw out the thermostat, you go to a different company, you get a download.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.400]   >> So, but you're ready to get a scenario where it really, where is the payment?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.160]   Where have they got you by the short hairs?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   >> Tender parts.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.400]   >> Your car doesn't start because unless you pay the ransomware.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   >> And our Tesla's are probably sitting ducks for that, right?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.800]   It's a truck about drive by wire.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.080]   I mean, it's all computer systems.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.360]   >> So, the question is, I'm not going to give up my Tesla, but I might give up my nest.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   The question is, has IoT become useful enough that it's worth it to brave the risks?
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.200]   And is it a big enough market that manufacturers will secure it better?
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.760]   >> I think we're getting to the point right now where manufacturers are securing things.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.080]   So we've stopped, we've almost stopped.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.320]   Probably in 2015 is when people really woke up to the fact that like, if you want to
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.840]   build a connected product, you shouldn't go to a contract manufacturer and have them
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.640]   do the software for your product.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.840]   So the problem is those devices were still coming out in 2016.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   So now we're, so the devices that are actually going to be secured all the way are going
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.040]   to be coming out like later this year, unless you're really particularly good company.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.000]   And there are those companies.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.280]   And for the devices that are out there that are not secure, there's a lot of like, we
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.680]   mo has a lot of issues.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.600]   Samsung has some issues with their products.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.520]   >> And these are big companies, these are not.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   >> Yeah, these are companies that basically made the call to not prioritize security because
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   customers wouldn't pay for it.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.200]   It didn't make economic sense.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.240]   Now it makes economic sense.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   They're investing in it.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.920]   And so you've got to look for companies that are actually willing to patch things.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   So.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.560]   And you know, our sponsor Ring, for instance, very famously, there was a security flaw in
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.880]   a ring and as soon as they were notified about it, they push, I don't even know they
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   could do it.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.880]   They pushed a firmware update down to the doorbell before it went public.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.240]   And that's what you're looking for, a company that has that capability firmware that gets
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.520]   regularly updated.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.800]   And a company that considers owning the software is important as owning the hardware.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.560]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.800]   So that's where I think things are going to go.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.880]   The other thing to think about though is these companies cannot, I mean, it sounds so obvious,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   but you can't rest on your laurels.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.760]   You've got to always be testing and being aware and updating your product.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.120]   And that's going to suck because not everybody has a business model.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.120]   >> That's kind of what I mean.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   You have to own your software.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   >> Is your product as much as the doorbell or the thermostat, the software is part of it?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.800]   >> Is there a company that now offers that as a service?
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.720]   >> Mm, there's companies that do like pin testing and white hack hackers that you can
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.920]   hire to test your product.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.520]   Now there's not a company necessarily that I can call to make sure I'm lying to my sister.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.680]   >> Oh, I see, right.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.880]   So there's, or it goes into this case.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   So they're right, there's two ways to it.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.640]   I was thinking it's kind of a software as a service, security as a service from the
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   manufacturing side.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   >> Well, there's a company that do that.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   >> Yeah, there's companies that do that.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   >> There there are.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   So they offer that.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   You can outsource that.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   >> Yeah, for years.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   The companies that do that for websites.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.840]   That's a big business is these companies that will.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   >> So IoT as well.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   Okay.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   >> So that's interesting Stacy.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   So is there a UL laboratories of security?
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   That's what we need.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.920]   >> UL has a security standard that a cyber kind of security standard.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.960]   >> I knew Stacy would know.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   >> There's also, I'm going to punt on the acronym for a minute.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.080]   Let me look and see what it there are several groups.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.320]   Verizon has one that's pretty exciting.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.280]   So let me find it out.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:27.960]   It's the IoT security certification from ICSA Labs, which is a third party testing and
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960]   cert product.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.240]   >> ICS has been doing this for other.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.680]   >> So there's actually they have a cert for IoT security.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.280]   And apparently this is kind of funny because I know the CEO of Canary or sorry the CTO of
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.560]   Canary and they actually got this designation a couple months ago.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.720]   And they were the first company that actually made it through the first time.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:58.120]   And the up until then the ICSA was like, maybe our standards are unrealistic.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   >> Wow.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.400]   >> But it was just that all these companies hadn't been controlling their whole process.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   >> They'd never done it before.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   >> They thought about it.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:15.880]   >> ICSA would be very, they're kind of the underwriters lab for digital stuff.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   And that would be really great.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.680]   They do have this ICSA Internet of Things Security Testing Framework.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.440]   This is exactly what you need.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.240]   And as consumers, what we need to do is we need to look for things that are UL certified
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.880]   or ICSA certified.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.000]   That would be nice to have that.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.280]   So there's that, but there's also things for consumers.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.440]   And this is why I'm wondering if there is a service opportunity in the market because
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.640]   there are still consumers who are using crappy passwords who don't change their password
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   on the router who use stupid SSIDs.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.280]   >> And generally in majority, right?
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.800]   >> I don't like to think that about my fellow people.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.680]   >> We've been beating the drum for years and certainly that's one of the things I do on
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.280]   the radio show where I'm talking to real people.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.480]   I mean, constantly, but I think that that's still a minority of the overall user base.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.280]   So that's another issue.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   And then finally, there is, on the consumer side, password reuse is actually a big issue
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.600]   because so many other companies are really crappy.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.880]   Like every time I implement a password with someone, I'm like, it's like my doctor's
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.560]   office, all these patient portals.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.360]   I have to have a password to get to my vets records.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   I mean, these guys are not taking good care of my credentials.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.600]   I know this, but it's hard for a consumer.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.200]   So I can see that being another weak point.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.600]   >> You want to be depressed?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   >> No.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   >> The most popular passwords of 2016.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   >> Yes.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.400]   We talked about the most popular passwords.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.040]   One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   Yeah, we did, didn't we?
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.440]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   Quirky.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.840]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.040]   One, one, one, one, one.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.480]   And on and on and on.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.840]   So that's not, it's not getting any better.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   Oh, that's right.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.760]   We did talk about this was the keeper security list that we talked about last week.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.320]   And we discovered one of the most common passwords is a bot.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   >> A bot.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   >> Password?
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   >> Yep.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   >> Our hard coded password rather.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.120]   >> This just in as we go to press about an hour ago, Facebook lost its Oculus lawsuit
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   >> Ooh.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.600]   >> A judgment of half a billion dollars to Jenny Max.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:45.160]   Jenny Max, of course, is the company that was created, that we created, owned id software
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:55.400]   and idcTO John Carmack went to Oculus and the contention is brought with him information.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   Jenny Max claimed Palmer Lucky violated an NDA in order to build early prototypes of
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.880]   its Oculus Rift headset.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.800]   Of course, so is this Palmer Lucky's fault?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.440]   >> Well, it's in East Texas jury.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.640]   >> It is not in East Texas jury.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.800]   >> Oh, it's a Texas jury.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   >> It was in Dallas.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   >> All right.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   It's a mid Texas jury.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   >> Sorry.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   I'm like, this is actually not the court that is so lenient.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   >> It's not Tyler Texas.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   Okay.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   All right.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   >> Sorry.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.560]   >> Cheryl Sandberg told recode.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.440]   It's not material to Facebook's business.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.000]   We're disappointed in certain elements of the decision and we're considering our options
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.680]   to appeal.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.600]   Facebook spokesperson said the heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole Zanymax
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.240]   trade secrets and the jury found decisively in our favor.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   >> What?
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.200]   >> We, okay.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   We're obviously, this is, wow.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.080]   We're obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today's verdict.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   >> What?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   >> But we're on the third.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   Well, you know how these things are.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.360]   There's probably several counts or several points.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.520]   >> Like, so it's half a billion bucks is what matters.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.080]   >> So it's all the Oculus people.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.400]   So Oculus is paying out 200 million.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.160]   Palmer Lucky and Brendan Eribe, the former CEO of Oculus.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.600]   >> They have to pay?
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.760]   >> They have to pay.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   >> Whoa.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   >> Whoa.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.720]   >> And how much do they make on the sale?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.200]   >> Well, they can afford it.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Let's put it that way.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   [LAUGH]
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   >> I guess the idea is.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.040]   >> Palmer, Oculus, 200 million for breaking the end of the day, 50 million for copyright
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   infringement.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.640]   Oculus and Lucky each have to pay 50 million for false designation.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.360]   Eribe has to pay 150 million for the same.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.920]   Yikes, Oculus says, we will appeal.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.360]   >> Right.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.560]   So this is a US district court in the north Texas, north district.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   All right.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.920]   So this is a somewhat respectable court.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.480]   >> Somewhat, somewhat respectable.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.360]   And you know, Facebook did release its earnings today.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   And let's see.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   >> It's the next news.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.400]   >> I was going to say how much money to pay this judgment.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800]   >> Stock went up 3% today.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   So what does that amount to?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   >> Add revenues up 53%.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.840]   That's a decent result.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.320]   >> It's more.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.840]   >> It's like it is.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.800]   >> They've got like, okay, yes.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.000]   So what were their earnings for the year?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.280]   >> Here I have the Forbes article in 3, 2.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   >> Never go to Forbes.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.400]   >> Oh, we're talking about that big banner Forbes puts up that says you can go to the
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   article in 3, 2, 1.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.560]   Revenue rose 51% in the fourth quarter year over year.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   8.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   Geez.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   All right.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.920]   Revenue went from 5.84 billion to 8.81 billion in the same period of year earlier.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.960]   That's considerably more than the consensus among analysts.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.920]   A record for Facebook at 7th straight quarterly revenue beat.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.720]   Boyed by mobile video ad sales, including those on Instagram, mobile ad revenue.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.440]   Get ready for this.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.000]   84% of total ad sales.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.040]   >> Oh, and how many years ago were we telling that Facebook was a mobile loser?
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.760]   Well, what we did say is, and this was when Facebook went public, they've got to figure
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.240]   out mobile ad revenue if they're going to go forward, will they did?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   >> Well, they did.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   >> Well, I was curious.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:34.440]   So they had 27.6 billion in total revenue in 2016, which makes a $500 million lawsuit
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.920]   actually still material.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   >> Okay.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   Half a billion is something.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   >> I mean, that's what I was like.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.320]   I was like, there's a handout of material.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   >> Yeah, no, no.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.440]   It's one seventh of their total profit this quarter.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   >> Oh, I mean- >> Revenue, revenue.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   >> No, no, I'm talking profit.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   Profit was 3.57 billion.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.240]   >> Oh, oh, yes.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.200]   >> So it's one seventh of their total profit.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   Well, you don't care what the revenue is.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.240]   How much did we make?
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   >> Right.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.040]   >> I know that from my business.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.160]   Well, we had fabulous revenue.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.840]   Yeah, but how much did I make?
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.920]   Well, we had a lot of expenses.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.720]   >> You spent it all on debt.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.120]   >> You bought a few too many computers, Leo.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.920]   >> In fact, excluding certain expenses, Facebook said it would have earned $4.15 billion.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.040]   They didn't mention what those other things are.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.440]   Company warned when it reported third quarter earnings last time that expenses in 2017
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.520]   will increase meaningfully.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   >> Right.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.360]   We can't- >> And then add load.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.520]   The volume of the ads the company can show users is less of a significant revenue growth
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.600]   factor this year.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.960]   So a strong quarter topping a strong year, she said Sheryl Sandberg and her analyst call.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   Businesses are making shifts to mobile and they're doing it on Facebook and Instagram.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.840]   Actually, did you see that Snapchat's lost a significant number of viewers to Instagram's
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   stories?
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   >> Yes.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.440]   Now here's a little fun thing to think about.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   We are moving to a voice first is kind of the key thing.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.560]   So remember how we were all mobile first and freaking out?
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   So now as we get to IoT, voice first, and I don't think it's going to be the sole way
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.440]   people access things.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.000]   But how do you generate revenue when people know what they want and just ask directly
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.960]   for it without mediating screens?
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.680]   >> Yeah, well, if you're Amazon.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   >> Right.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   >> Good.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   >> Right.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   >> If you're Google.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   >> Google.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.240]   >> Google's in trouble.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.800]   Like Google doesn't have a great business model yet for selling ads or selling anything.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.520]   >> Because there's no ad in that search result.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   You're right.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520]   You're using Google search.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.560]   >> Well, there's also no media brand there.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   >> Right.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.440]   So this is if you want people to start thinking ahead.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.640]   This is where I'm thinking ahead because I'm like looking at everybody's business model
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.680]   saying, my gosh, how are they going to play in this world first?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.240]   But two, how do you make money when you take away screens?
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.520]   And you shouldn't think about it as taking away screens when screens become not necessarily
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.480]   the primary interaction with computing.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:14.560]   >> Well, once again, just purely by luck, I chose the right model for our podcasts because
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.320]   they were great in audio.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   >> Win!
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   >> Win for me.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   >> Oh, true.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   Win for me too.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.680]   >> Yeah, for all of us because we're podcasters first and foremost.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.280]   >> I'm a journalist first and foremost.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah, that.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   >> No.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.480]   >> I'm going to interview today for Yahoo, for Katie Kirk, thing they're doing on podcasts.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.600]   I made a point of plugging.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Thank you.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.360]   But Ann saying podcasts have been around for a long time, been very successful.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.480]   I'm just proud to be coming to the table.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.800]   >> We never had a rental loss.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   We always made money.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   >> Never.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   >> Mostly because we couldn't not make money.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.600]   >> Yeah, because you had no capital.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.520]   I can only spend what I made.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   >> I've been in business a year now, you guys.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.960]   By the way, I should say.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.520]   >> I was so excited I knocked my microphone over.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   Congratulations.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   >> That was exciting.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520]   >> Is it exactly a year?
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.040]   What's the anniversary?
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.600]   >> So the 27th of January is when I quit fortune to start my own gig.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   And so now it's been a year and almost a week.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   >> I know.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   It's exciting.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   >> That's right.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   Congratulations.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   >> Hello, you've been on the show now.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   >> May, maybe.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.600]   >> It'll be a year soon.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   >> Oh, man.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.440]   That makes me so happy.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440]   >> That's so appropriate.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   >> Because that's a scary thing to do.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   Right?
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.920]   >> Yes, no, it was super scary.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.680]   It's still super scary.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.200]   But I'm really excited.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.600]   And so, and thank you.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.800]   I should say a big thank you.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.360]   This I'm going to get all mushy.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.720]   Thank you, you guys.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.400]   So we love you and we're just, you know what?
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   I love seeing individuals able to take off with their own brand.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   I just love it when that happens.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.400]   And most of the people we work with have done that, you know?
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.600]   They have their own personal brand.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.480]   >> I still feel weird saying those words.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   >> I do too.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   It's a creepy thing.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.800]   I know, I agree with you.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   I don't like it either.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   It's creepy.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.120]   But here's the non-creepy side of it.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.320]   You own your destiny.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   >> True.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.240]   >> So you, so it doesn't have to be, the brand doesn't have to be Leo, Leo, Leo.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.000]   It has to, you know, the brand could be give you value, you know, help people, you know,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.240]   whatever, inform people, entertain people.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.000]   But but but the real point is that you control your destiny.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.600]   To me, that was what it was all about.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   And I'm sure for you too.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.280]   I mean, you were in the similar situation where Gigo Home just disappeared one day.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   >> Yes.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.920]   >> And everything you'd done for that brand was taken away.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.400]   >> Yes.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.280]   >> Well, same thing happened to me with tech TV, right?
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.040]   Same thing happened with Jeff for Entertainment Weekly.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.000]   >> Well, I was like, no, Entertainment Weekly is still around.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.080]   >> No, but but the Addison Harold Register should call you the day that the paper that
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.080]   I don't know the borrow.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   The San Francisco is amnoreau.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   I've killed lots of places.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.440]   >> The San Francisco is still around, but it's like a tabloid giveaway now.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.440]   >> It's not a paper.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   It's not a newspaper.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.920]   >> Facebook's monthly active users.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.520]   Oh, I always like this number.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.120]   This isn't a number that has anything to do with profit.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.920]   Well, I guess maybe it does.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.480]   1.86 billion monthly active users.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.920]   That's a 17% year over year growth.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   Daily active users.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.000]   Remember when we made a big deal that they had a billion users?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   >> Oh, huge deal.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.160]   >> Daily active users 1.23 billion.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   Daily.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.360]   >> That's like a seventh of the world's population.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.160]   >> Every day.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.200]   >> Ridiculous.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.920]   >> I need a better color if I'm going to highlight this.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.520]   Let's make this bright red and super bold.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.320]   >> You just need a bigger pen.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.480]   There you go.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.280]   >> Yo, it's toys.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.280]   Yo.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   Now I know.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.200]   Now I know educationally.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.800]   User activity on Facebook's suite of apps I can hardly read.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.760]   Wait a minute, let me erase this.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.080]   User activity on Facebook's suite of apps continues to grow Facebook owned, messaging
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.000]   apps, WhatsApp and Messenger.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.920]   Both.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.280]   More than a billion monthly active users.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.360]   Each.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.600]   Instagram has not grown that much though, right?
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.920]   600 million was what they had last year, I thought.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   That's Instagram.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.160]   >> Well, they're in a race against Snapchat.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   >> Right.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.320]   If they can just hold their own, that's good, right?
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.400]   >> I think they want younger people, right?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   Do they care?
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.160]   >> Well, everybody wants younger people.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.560]   Yeah, they don't want us.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.240]   Speaking for Leo and me.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   >> They don't want me either.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   I'm Gen X.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.760]   I mean, nobody wants Gen X.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.480]   >> Oh, I think Gen X is better than millennials.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.960]   >> No, no, everyone loves the millennials.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   >> Oh, I know.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   >> I know.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.600]   >> Because they're so fabulous.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.160]   >> Jeff and I were baby boomers.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.400]   We used to be like that.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.080]   >> Oh, you guys are ruining the planet.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.880]   >> We used to be the ones everybody wanted.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.840]   Used to be all about us.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.960]   >> No one ever wanted me in Gen X.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   We're just.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   >> We're going to sandwich in there.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.560]   You're the dazed and confused generation.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   >> Okay.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   >> All right.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.560]   Enough of Facebook.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   How about alphabet?
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:35.240]   >> Google reported mixed earnings for its fourth quarter.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.640]   >> Alphabet's other bit.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   Well, let's see.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   Alphabet's.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.560]   >> Larry's looking mature now.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.400]   Larry's thinking, where's Sergey?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   Where'd he go?
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.480]   Is he at the airport again?
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.840]   What's going on?
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   That is a definitely a far distance stare.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.080]   He's thinking about something.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   He's puzzling.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   >> Always is.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.280]   >> I wonder how my island's doing and when I can go.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   >> Yeah, he's out.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   Please, please, let me build the island.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   >> I'm going to go to the island.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   >> We're moving.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.680]   I'm buying the condo in the island right now.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   >> Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.360]   Isn't that what Peter was it?
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   >> They want a sea stick.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.800]   >> I wouldn't live in teal land, but I'd live in in Larryland.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   >> Larryland?
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   >> Is it different?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.760]   >> Like 100 years from now, it'll be like water world and we'll all just be in different
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.560]   floating continents.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.880]   >> Well, seriously, if Larry built a floating country, I would move in a flash.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.640]   >> Is it Peter built a floating country?
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   >> No.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   >> No.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.680]   >> Who else would you accept as your technology dictator?
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   >> Not Zuckerberg.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.360]   >> Bill Gross.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.200]   Bill Gross is magnificent.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.360]   >> The best.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   My roommate in Davos.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   >> Bill, he was the best.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360]   >> I know.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.000]   That's why I have three.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.160]   >> I would, you know what, Paul Graham?
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.880]   >> Really?
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.240]   >> I know, people think, I know, but I think Paul's very smart and I know teal is also,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.040]   you know, Y Combinator board and all that.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.000]   But I really think Paul Graham is pretty sharp.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.480]   >> I think Reid Hoffman.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   >> Reid Hoffman.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.360]   >> He's a thoughtful fellow.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   >> Very smart.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   >> Founder of LinkedIn.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   >> How about Andreessen?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.200]   >> Would you live in Andreessen Landry?
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   >> No, Andreessen's.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   >> Markville's a bullet shaped nut ball.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.960]   >> I do like- >> Wasn't very nice of you, Leo.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.800]   You said bad things about me too.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.600]   >> I do like- >> Really?
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.520]   >> I do like Reid Hastings of Netflix.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.320]   >> No, you'd be fun, yeah.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520]   >> I'm going to see- >> I'm going to see Ireland.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.120]   The entertainment we could chill the whole time.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.640]   >> How about Bezosville?
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.000]   >> It'd be very- >> Bezos will be-
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.280]   >> Bezos will stand.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.520]   It would be Bezos to stand.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.800]   So the question is, are you willing to give up a lot of personal freedom to be a winner?
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   >> No.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.960]   >> Just sounded like the president-
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   >> I'm kidding.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.480]   >> Winning is overrated in that context.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.680]   >> We're sick of winning, right?
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Aren't we tired of winning?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   He said we're tired of winning.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   I'm tired of winning.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   >> No, I'm on a win.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.320]   >> I don't think I've ever been on the winning side.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   I'm like, wait a second.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.560]   When did that last happen?
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.600]   >> You come from that generation where everybody's a winner.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.360]   You all get participation trophies.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.840]   >> I never got a participation trophy.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.600]   Also my mom let me fail on a regular basis so I would learn something.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   It was cruel.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   >> That's mean.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.840]   It sounds like you got a little anger at it.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   >> Something brutal.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.320]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.920]   Would you live in Muscopeia?
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   >> Who's that?
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   >> Ela Elon Muscopeia.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   >> Ela Elon Muscopeia.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.120]   >> Where we'd all drive in tunnels under the ground.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   >> I don't know.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   I don't know.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   >> Well- >> It'd be good for the credit overall.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   >> I like you.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.120]   >> Unless it's on Mars.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.600]   If it's on Mars, I don't want to-
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.120]   >> Well, but it might be on Mars.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   You might have to get- >> Well, that's-
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.920]   >> That's- >> No, James?
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.720]   He's trying really hard.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   >> Yeah, he's proven to be- >> So this raises the topic I think we've
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.560]   talked about before, which is this lack of empathy issue.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.160]   Like many of these guys are very smart.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.560]   >> Had Maasri Woyer.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.880]   I would live on her island.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   >> Who's that?
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.600]   >> She was the former CIO of Cisco, no CTO of Cisco.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.000]   And now she's the CEO at some electric car company.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.600]   >> I'm bringing out a woman because- >> That's cool.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.880]   I'd rather live on an island that's governed by a woman.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   >> I think it's- >> All right, Cheryl Sambert.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.200]   >> A tri.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   Cheryl Sambert, because patriarchy not working out so good.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.760]   >> You know, Cheryl has some empathy.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.040]   I- >> No, no, no, no, don't come do it.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.840]   >> I think the whole country would lean, but I think it would be a nice place.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.880]   >> We'd all be leaning in, the whole thing would be leaning in.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.520]   But I think she's got a heart.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.800]   >> She has a heart and she's willing to, the nice thing about a lot of female leaders is
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.440]   they're willing to say, you know what?
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.240]   She acknowledges the flaws and lean in now.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:17.120]   And she's willing to let her life experience a shaper in a way that not everybody lets their life experience a shaper.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.320]   >> I think that- >> Exactly.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.920]   >> I think she would be an empathetic leader.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.920]   >> But everything is that- >> Wow.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   >> So that was what I was going to say is that some of these guys are analytic and very smart.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.240]   Now everyone we've mentioned is very smart, very analytic, very talented.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.760]   The trains would run on time, let's say.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.880]   But perhaps- >> Not an, not an, not an Elonville.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.400]   >> And an Elonville, the trains would be persistently late?
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.280]   >> Oh, yes.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.920]   >> Because he's always late for his- >> He's late for everything.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.480]   >> Yeah. >> Yes.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.320]   >> Yeah, so why?
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.440]   So that's why I like him.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.120]   That's what I want.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.880]   I want somewhere where you, manana, that's why I'm moving to Latin America.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.080]   It's all relaxed.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.400]   It's all tomorrow, whatever, it'll be fine.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   Just relax, enjoy life.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.480]   [LAUGH] The uncoolah.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.000]   Anyway, [LAUGH]
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.680]   Alphabet's other bets.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:17.000]   So, Alphabet's other bets would be all the little alphabet companies besides Google.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.800]   262 million in revenue.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.880]   That's like nothing.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.960]   >> That's their hobbies.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.760]   But it is a job.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.960]   It was 150 million a year ago.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:35.720]   Companies losses shrank from 1.2 billion to about 1.1 billion.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.920]   So when I say revenue, I'm not talking profit because they lost money.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.640]   So basically these are not revenue generating projects.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.360]   >> I thought they're Alphabet's operating loss.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.320]   Oh, that's an operating loss, not a net loss, sorry.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.440]   >> Oh, I don't know.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.760]   I don't know this accounting stuff.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.360]   Nest, are they going to hold on?
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.640]   Okay, Stacy, you may stop right there.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.360]   Nest isn't making any inroads.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.920]   It was even me.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.800]   Are they going to hold on to this?
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.520]   Are they going to kill it?
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.360]   Are they going to get rid of it like Motorola?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.920]   What do you think?
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.280]   >> That's a really good question.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.240]   I think some of the technologies that Nest brought in,
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.280]   they're still investing in.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.520]   If they're going to be like,
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.480]   yeah, let's make a lot more thermostats and a lot more cameras.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:29.960]   I don't know if we should look for more new products out there.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   I don't know if they're going to sell it because they still have that $3.2
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.920]   billion price tag.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.080]   They've got to figure out how to recoup the investment on.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.760]   >> They haven't written down yet?
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.920]   >> No, it's not been written down.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.120]   >> Mm.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   >> No, I would have noticed if they wrote that down.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.520]   >> So they're still holding out, I would think.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.000]   >> Sorry, sorry, I interrupted you, Leo.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.880]   You were going through the list.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.840]   >> He's still puzzling out accounting.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.240]   >> I'm just so complicated at trying to.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.000]   Here's revenue.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.600]   Google is the blue, and if you look really closely,
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   the other bets are the red.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.680]   >> Yes.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.240]   >> Okay.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:15.640]   >> Yes.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.240]   >> So the other bets include access, Google Fiber, Calico.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.440]   Is that their life extension thing, Calico?
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.080]   >> No, barely is life extension, Calico.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.960]   Isn't that the contact lens, Calico, hold on.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:35.880]   >> Nest, Google Ventures, Google Capital, and the X Research and Development stuff.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.320]   So you could see enough other bets don't.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.840]   >> That's irrelevant to the overall age.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:42.840]   >> Ageing.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.960]   >> Calico is aging.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.480]   >> Calico is aging.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:45.960]   >> Life extension.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.880]   >> Oh, it barely might be the contact lens.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.000]   Gosh, I might have it wrong.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.320]   >> Okay.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.680]   >> How about that?
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.120]   >> How has it wrong?
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.240]   >> Fairly is life sciences.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.160]   Okay, it barely is also.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.760]   >> Both of them.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.960]   >> All right.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.520]   >> Both of them.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.160]   >> Now I should remember who's doing the contact lens.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.040]   >> Is that a, see, that's a problem.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.960]   It's none of this stuff is a productized, right?
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.680]   It's just, do they even mention the cars?
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.000]   Watch what's all it?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.400]   Wemo?
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.560]   >> Wemo's, yeah, no.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.800]   Oh, there really was the contact lens, but it doesn't really exist.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.760]   >> It's just somebody's bright idea.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.360]   >> So there we go.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.400]   >> So that's the other bets.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.840]   Let's look at Google earnings.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.320]   There it is.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.080]   Google and Novartis won't be testing the smart contact lens after all.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.720]   Says that story in Fortune magazine.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.520]   Whatever happened to Fortune, after Stacey left, I stopped reading it.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.960]   No, actually, you know what Matthew Ingram's been writing?
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.600]   >> I'm still there.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.840]   >> He's been writing some great stuff of late and fortune,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.080]   and he's really, his beat has broadened a lot.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.760]   He's writing about life and politics and all sorts of stuff.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:59.080]   >> Well, he writes about media and politics is a huge--
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.680]   >> I guess it's a big part of media, isn't it?
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:09.960]   >> Let's see, I'm trying to find the Google earnings, broken out Google earnings.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.400]   >> Just Google Google business.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.320]   >> This is way too broken out.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.720]   I can't--
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:24.040]   This is like EPS cons surprise.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.840]   It looks like they did not--
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.600]   they failed to meet expectations.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   It was a negative 31 cents per share.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.880]   Revs, 26.04 billion in Rev.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.680]   Maybe I can get the details.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.720]   Let's look at the details.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.800]   I don't like--
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.440]   I don't know.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.520]   This is why I can't invest money.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.160]   Oh my gosh.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.280]   Here's this is a three months ending December 31st, 2016.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.120]   That would be the current quarter.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.480]   26 billion in revenue, increase in revenue year over year, 22%.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.160]   Nice.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.480]   Generally accepted accounting practices operating income,
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.520]   6 billion operating margin, 25%.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.880]   Now Apple's to contrast operating margin is like 40%,
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.000]   but hardware always a little bit more.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.080]   >> Okay.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.680]   Is that operating to operating?
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   >> Is it captain on gap?
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.160]   I don't know.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.440]   You're asking me that?
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.320]   Are you asking me that?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:17.880]   >> Okay.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.440]   No, I wasn't.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   I was asking if it was operating or net.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.120]   So just revenue and net income.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.720]   That's where you should just focus for--
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.440]   >> Yes.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.600]   Revenue and net income.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.360]   >> So not operating, just net income.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.080]   >> Right.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.640]   >> Because that'll take out--
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.520]   >> Operating will screw you up.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.640]   >> EBITDA.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.760]   >> EBITDA.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.640]   >> EBITDA.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.440]   So I don't know what the answer to your question.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.000]   No idea.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.400]   >> Next time I'm going to look ahead.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.760]   >> Which could please read the--
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.960]   >> Next year.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.200]   >> You could--
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.880]   Sounds like you can read a balance sheet.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.160]   >> I can.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.880]   I took the sort of chartered financial analyst example.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.800]   >> What you did is for--
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:49.960]   >> I did.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.920]   >> To be a better reporter.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.880]   >> Yes.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.200]   >> Good.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.680]   >> Google.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.880]   >> Effective tax rate.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.200]   Okay.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.120]   So I always look at that.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.240]   I don't know why-- because it mainly--
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.280]   because I get jealous.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.400]   Because as normal people are tax rate,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.000]   30, 40, 50%.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.800]   Apple's 26%.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.680]   Google's 22%.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.400]   They paid 22%.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.880]   And you know why that is?
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.600]   Because they're offshoring all their profits.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:22.120]   >> So I did an interview on what might be the last episode of
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.840]   dot NYC.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.640]   That's another story.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.120]   >> What?
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.040]   >> We ran out of our grant money.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.080]   And so I got to figure out what to do.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.360]   We'll have that discussion.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.640]   We finally got our act together.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.760]   >> I saw them.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.120]   >> I saw I thought it was the first episode of something.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.800]   It was your new Kickstarter program.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.760]   Are you going to keep doing that?
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.640]   >> No, this was the same thing.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.880]   But I interviewed the chief legal officer.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.800]   I hope we can keep going, but I've got to raise money to do it.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.280]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.880]   Grant had a limited--
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.400]   >> So I interviewed
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:52.200]   McCall Rosen, who's the chief legal officer, a Kickstarter.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.560]   And she is the one who did the conversion of Kickstarter
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.000]   to a public benefit corporation.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.880]   >> Good.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.320]   And really, really interesting.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.480]   If you look up a dot on YC, you can see it yesterday.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.760]   She's fascinating.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.720]   And it's just 25 minutes.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.680]   >> That sounds great.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.320]   I'll watch.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.040]   >> But in a CPP, you list the things that you're going to hold to.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.080]   And one of them is that they'll pay their share of taxes,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.840]   and they won't go through various tax shelters like this.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.000]   And that that's a way that they're
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.920]   telling warning their shareholders that we ain't going to minimize taxes.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   And thus maximize profit through that direction.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.320]   Interesting.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.880]   Because the problem is, if you are a regular corporation
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.040]   and you have fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.240]   the reason I defend the Google's Amazon's Facebook,
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.200]   Starbucks, and such is that they do have to minimize their taxes
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.160]   to maximize their profit.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:50.280]   >> Although, you can make an argument that maximizing your profit
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.240]   is not the only thing that you have a fiduciary to do.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.040]   A fiduciary duty to do for your shareholders.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.960]   There's some really interesting writings about this
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.760]   in business schools now in the last couple of years
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.680]   about what constitutes fiduciary duty.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.520]   >> I will agree with you, but what happens when you have an act
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.880]   of a shareholder coming after you?
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.840]   >> Well, that's why this is so fascinating.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.600]   That's becoming part of the legal theory.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.560]   And you could get economists to say, yeah, you should take into factor
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.240]   externalities like legal costs.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.800]   Do you have a fiduciary duty as the big company,
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.160]   not to pollute the river your workers all come in from
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   or the ground underneath where your workers live?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.560]   I don't know.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.720]   Okay, sorry, total segue or total side thing.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.680]   Go on, Jeff.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.760]   >> We call those a rat hole.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.000]   We used to have a rat hole jingle.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.440]   >> I was going to go.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.000]   >> No.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.960]   >> Maryland man recorded a rat hole jingle for us.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.480]   We did so many rat holes on Macbruch.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.600]   >> Did we have that?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.800]   >> No, it was on Macbruch weekly.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.760]   >> Oh, it was on Macbruch weekly.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.040]   >> ♪ Rat hole. ♪
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.080]   >> So what do we think?
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.320]   I looked at Facebook's results and it was good, good, good.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.800]   >> What do we think of?
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.360]   >> Googles.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.160]   >> Googles got--
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.880]   >> I mean, the question is how long does Facebook have before?
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.240]   >> It looks like Google.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.360]   >> It's the law of numbers.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.440]   It's growing like crazy.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.720]   It may have a long way to go, I don't know.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.760]   >> Because Google's older, it's kind of in a more mature environment,
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.880]   so it's not going to grow as fast.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.600]   >> How can you grow at that rate forever?
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.160]   You cannot.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.960]   >> You will like this.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:41.560]   Google's AMP is now twice as prevalent in Google News.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:48.120]   So if you want to be showing up in the Google News,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.760]   you better AMP.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.120]   You know, I'm going to be critical of AMP here.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:57.160]   This to me, this is a point against AMP, but go ahead.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:57.960]   You know, this story--
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.160]   >> Well, yeah, yes, exactly.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.000]   For two reasons, two reasons I have a problem.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.720]   One is that you can't be kind of
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.000]   moumout into having AMP because you're going to show up in Google.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.680]   That's a conflict and I agree with you, Leo, on that.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.000]   And the second is they haven't solved the URL problem.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.920]   When I get links from Nuzzle and places like that to an AMP page,
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:23.080]   it's google.com/ that's supposed to be like, you know, just a CDN.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.720]   It's not supposed to be the domain and they haven't fixed that.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.480]   And that's a problem for media companies.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.400]   >> So to recapitulate for those who haven't been around for the AMP wars over the last year,
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.720]   AMP is a Google technology that they say is designed to speed up mobile web page loading
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:43.640]   by eliminating a lot of stuff, including ugly ad tech, most JavaScript.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.440]   They cache a lot of content.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.960]   And as a result, AMP pages pop right up on mobile.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.320]   They're really, really fast.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.040]   But you have to do it this now, AMP to be fair.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.800]   An AMP page looks fine.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.880]   You know, it doesn't require, you know, an AMP player.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.480]   You publishers don't have to use AMP or they can use AMP and it doesn't harm them
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.320]   with normal non-AMPed sites.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.720]   But my fear always was that because it goes, it's kind of,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.880]   Google says it's open, but really Google runs all the caches and does all,
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.920]   and is the one that approves all the JavaScript, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.040]   with some input from other.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.680]   We've had Richard Gingris, head of Google News, who's a big AMP proponent on the show,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.200]   and we debated all this.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.560]   But this is a scary point.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:38.520]   In the last three days, Google has flipped a switch and AMP content on January 26th,
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.240]   last Thursday, a week ago, was about 30% of the Google News results.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:50.440]   Yesterday, no, I'm sorry, Sunday, a few days later, 70%, so they flipped a switch
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   and are now highly prioritizing AMP pages, which puts even more pressure on publishers
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.560]   to support the AMP standard.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.920]   There are competing standards, right?
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.960]   Facebook has its, is that still around?
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.640]   Oh, yeah, it's an article?
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.360]   Oh, it's an article.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:17.720]   I just, I think Google's goals are laudable, but I worry a little bit that it's a little bit
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.800]   of a grab of web standards by...
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.080]   Yeah, I don't think that was the goal.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.280]   I think they're sincere when they say that they're defending open standards,
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.960]   but they've got to get there now.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.000]   Yeah, you could, and as Blake is pointing out in the chatroom,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.520]   you don't have to use Google's caching.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.400]   You could cache it yourself.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   You can run your own AMP server if you want.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.640]   But still Google proves what JavaScript's allowed, etc., etc.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.920]   And as made deals with advertisers like Outbrain and Tabula,
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.840]   as well as Google AdSense to work with AMP.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:43:00.920]   And once you, so I think I sent you this back in November, but a friend of mine wrote this blog about
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.840]   it's called Gamp, Gamp.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.680]   Google's AMP is a gilded cage.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.160]   Yes.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:15.000]   And he basically talked about how once he installed it, all his pages went to a certain place.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.200]   And then now when he decided to uninstall it, he was hosed.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.680]   Right.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.040]   And the links stopped working.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.000]   And that was kind of a challenge.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.480]   It was like, oh, that's not...
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.160]   AMP is like Hotel California.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.360]   There you go.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:28.840]   You could check it out.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.720]   Or like AWS.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.440]   You can't leave.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.920]   Well, anyway, the good...
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.280]   So that's a bad data point.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.720]   That's several bad data points.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.200]   But the good news is I don't think AMP has really
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.680]   chewed up the world or anything.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.960]   I mean, I see plenty of non-AMP pages all the time.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.840]   Well, that's the same argument that the telcos make about zero rating.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.040]   And chewed up the world yet.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.960]   Hey, by the way, data point we talked, we debated last week.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.480]   The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, and his long-term goals.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.680]   Well, one of your predictions came true this week.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.640]   Ajit Pai silently canceled the requirement that cable companies
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.640]   offer third-party set-top boxes.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.320]   I hate it when I'm right.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:19.480]   Actually, I'm going to give myself a little pat on the back.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.640]   I think I also said that last week that that's probably what this is going to mean.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.240]   That, yes.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.240]   I hate it when you're right.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.440]   We're both right.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.920]   We'll see what happens with net neutrality.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.680]   But I think that's a very anti-consumer, frankly.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.880]   I think yes, sir.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.920]   His consumers really would love to be able to run something
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.200]   besides the junkie box, the cable company rents.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.760]   Well, the cool thing is, it was going to make,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.840]   it was basically going to turn your television screen into what is the internet,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.400]   because it would let people run apps and search.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   Yes.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.320]   And it was going to be--
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.880]   And innovate.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.920]   Awesome.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.000]   And companies like Google and Apple and Roku were thrilled because--
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.920]   In Amazon and Microsoft?
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   And Amazon.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.360]   They could sell you set-top boxes.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.920]   But the cable companies lobbied hard against this because they said, and to be--
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.240]   we'll try to balance this a little bit, they said,
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.560]   "Hey, that's our business, is what we present to our customer.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.920]   Controlling what we present to our customer is how we make money,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.640]   and you can't take that away from us."
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.720]   So what's interesting there is it feels and the parallels are not all exact,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:33.240]   but Carderphone and AT&T is kind of where it feels like for--
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.640]   Carderphone was a famous--
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   I think it was a Supreme Court.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.520]   Was it? No, maybe it was.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.320]   It was?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.920]   Carderphone was Supreme Court, I believe.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.760]   It's a decision that allowed third-party equipment to be used on AT&T lines.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.240]   AT&T wanted it require you to buy those old Western electric hard rubber phones.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:55.560]   And the Supreme Court ruled that AT&T's contention that it would be
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.400]   bad for service if we allowed third-party devices,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.440]   untested third-party devices on our lines.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.040]   The Supreme Court said, "Nope," and opened up for competition,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.720]   and you could see what a difference that's made.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.280]   Let's see, the FCC made a decision.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.440]   Did it go all the way to the courts?
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.000]   Oh, I'm sure.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.360]   Yeah, that was definitely a court case.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.160]   [singing]
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.280]   Oh, it was 40 years ago.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.560]   What's the date?
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.280]   It was an age.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.160]   Oh, okay, that's an old.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:25.800]   Those are age.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.040]   Okay.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040]   You know, this is--
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.600]   This says--
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.240]   Oh, yeah, years ago.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.760]   This is only saying it's--
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.160]   Oh.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.240]   FCC decision.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:33.640]   Okay.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.680]   But--
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.160]   What was it?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.640]   Carderphone.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.200]   Really?
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.720]   No, Carder took AT&T in general telephoned a federal court.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.280]   In 1966, the Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit agreed they would decide the suit,
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.520]   but the FCC, at that point, ruled, and I guess that means--
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.760]   This just says it's a landmark regulatory decision.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.640]   That means the FCC made the decision.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.360]   Yep, that's right.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.800]   And effectively making the court case irrelevant.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.640]   Ta-da!
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:03.880]   Okay.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.000]   Very nicely done.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Facts.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.880]   Facts.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.240]   Facts.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.040]   Wikipedia.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.920]   Yes.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.520]   Okay.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.800]   For the win.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.360]   For the win.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.320]   All right.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.920]   Anyway, we're not going to see a carderphone with cable companies.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.800]   No carderphone for you.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.400]   Well, you do have Roku and people are bypassing it anyway.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:27.800]   Well, that--
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.200]   And I think--
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:28.600]   Just to be a--
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.000]   I can't.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.080]   That's the bottom line is it's just one more nail in the coffin for the cable companies.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.240]   They probably didn't see it that way, but it's just one more reason for people to cut the cord,
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.200]   get rid of that $7 a month or whatever it is rental fee, and that crap box and do their own thing.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.320]   And the cable guys know this is coming, but like any good business, they're like,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.160]   "Well, how long can we milk this?"
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:49.640]   They're holding on.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.600]   What else can we add to these fees that people pay?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.200]   All the more as long as they can.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.440]   And I can't blame them for that.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.040]   All right.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.720]   Well, I could blame the FCC for not ruling--
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.520]   The FCC had approved this, but it was rolled back by Adjut Pie.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.840]   Sorry.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.960]   Oh, wait, is the Supergo-- is the Supergo--
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   Supergo?
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.440]   Supergo?
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:12.920]   Supergo?
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.160]   Is this--
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.040]   Is it going to be--
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.840]   It's this week.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.720]   Is it going to be on cable or is it streamed or what's the deal there?
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.120]   It's both.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.240]   If you're a violent customer, you can watch it.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.800]   Verizon has an exclusive with the internet.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.280]   BIOS?
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.640]   BIOS?
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.440]   No, no, on the phone.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.480]   Your phones are phone.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.920]   Oh, like I want to watch the Superbowl on my phone.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:31.400]   Or tablet.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.560]   Well, you could cast it to the screen.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.440]   Can you cast it from their apps?
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:38.920]   I don't know.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.720]   It depends on Verizon.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.520]   I don't have a Verizon--
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   As one might know, I don't have a Verizon phone.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:44.840]   Yes.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   I have a Verizon phone.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.960]   I'm not watching the Superbowl,
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.760]   but I am interested in the puppy bowl on Animal Planet.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.720]   So that, I would also have that be streamed.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.240]   My daughter is Team Fluff,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.120]   and I am Team Ruff for this year's puppy bowl.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.400]   You know what reminds me of the puppy bowl?
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.720]   The US media.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.920]   You ever--
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.680]   I was thinking about this in the shower.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.880]   The master of the segment.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   I was thinking about this in the shower this morning.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.080]   If you've ever watched five-year-olds play soccer, right?
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.480]   They just chase the ball.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.840]   They do-- there's no strategy.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.960]   It's just like a blob around the ball all the time.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.720]   And I'm thinking that the US media these days is like that.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.640]   That all--
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.520]   President Trump has to do his duty.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.880]   Not nearly as cute though.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.960]   They just have to tweet or whatever,
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.560]   and suddenly the story's over there.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.160]   And they all run over there.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.680]   Why?
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.760]   So this is something I have thought about a lot,
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.680]   partially because I write about things
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.760]   that many people are not interested in.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.520]   You need to learn more puppies.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.040]   Right.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.800]   Well, I do think that.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.200]   I--
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.240]   The Internet of puppies.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:55.960]   There you got it.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.440]   The challenge for media is there are people who sound the alarm
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   and say things and write stories,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.360]   but if they don't get picked up by some ineffable--
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.800]   and I'm not talking about going viral.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.840]   I'm just talking about it.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.000]   Right.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.960]   Because ultimately the news media covers everything.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.480]   Right.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.120]   It's just what do people notice at the time?
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.280]   But I'm thinking-- I mean, I think that the predominantly,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.840]   though, the networks and the cable news networks
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.600]   kind of drive the agenda, right?
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.040]   So what they're covering,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.160]   it doesn't matter if some blog somewhere is covering.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.920]   Well, that's my thought.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.440]   I mean, that's the tough thing.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.080]   Like, I--
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.560]   OK, so here's a super techie example.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.960]   I was writing about the peering debates
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.080]   and actually doing real reporting on that
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:45.560]   like about a year and a half before other people were.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.040]   Right.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.600]   In--
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.280]   It was too complicated for real people.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.160]   Oh, god.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.280]   It was so complicated.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.160]   Every story was a thousand words just to like--
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.200]   Explain it.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.320]   Yeah, I was like, oh, god.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   Oh, god.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.880]   Although after doing that, I could like 30 minutes,
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.280]   I could churn out like a thousand words explaining theory.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:04.840]   That, of course.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.400]   Go, go.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.560]   And then tiny little bit of news on top.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:14.440]   But that was a story that had like legit interest and impact.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.800]   Yes, it was complicated.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.840]   But even things like broadband rural access or digital divide,
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.120]   that was a big story.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.800]   And I had been writing about it forever.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.160]   And then I think it was the Wall Street Journal picked up on it.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.000]   And they had those kids like unable to get their homework assignment.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.440]   So they were working at McDonald's,
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.120]   which was a great lead that I did not have.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.640]   Data caps were another one that I'm like,
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.480]   it's just not ready until it's ready.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:39.960]   I don't know.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.160]   I don't know how else to say it.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.320]   Well, the reason--
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.320]   I mean, of course, we're not going to get political,
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.720]   but the reason I was thinking about it is I was thinking how,
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.960]   with the nomination of Gorsuch,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.880]   New Gorsuch is our Supreme Court,
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.400]   next Supreme Court Justice to take Scalia's seat,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.000]   all of us like a bunch of five-year-olds,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.360]   that's going to be the story for the next six months or three months,
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.320]   however long it takes.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.440]   And meanwhile, Russian hacking, conflicts of interest,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.600]   none of that is on the map anymore.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.400]   And if one were a savvy media person,
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.280]   one could manipulate the media pretty effectively.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.960]   Yes, one could.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.680]   Because they're like five-year-olds playing soccer,
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.760]   or puppies in the--
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.320]   Actually, puppies in the puppy ball are not a good example,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.640]   because they don't even know about the ball.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.720]   They're scratching their ears, they're looking around.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   Ball in the ball.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.040]   You don't need a ball in the puppy ball.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.320]   You just puppies in a cage or whatever, an arena.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.760]   So until we're back to our business model of chasing clicks,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.400]   there was an op-head this last week though,
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.800]   that said that CNN should be broken off,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.920]   and it should go for not-for-profit.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.000]   It's a journalist having a fear of profitability and capitalism,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   which I think is kind of ridiculous.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.720]   Well, there is a case to be made that since the Time Warner AT&T merger
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.920]   is up in front of government regulation,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.320]   and CNN is owned by Time Warner,
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.320]   that there might be some subtle pressure on CNN to tow the line
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.720]   until that merger is approved, right?
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.200]   Now--
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.480]   Though you know who is feuding with CNN.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.840]   Right.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.160]   That's the point.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.840]   Is CNN mitter shape up, or you're not going to get your merger?
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:37.320]   So there is a point to be made that for-profit media
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.000]   may have vulnerabilities that nonprofit media doesn't.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.720]   But what is nonprofit pro-publica, right?
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.080]   There isn't a lot.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.840]   Mother Jones is nonprofit.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.800]   You can't say public broadcasting is because
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.200]   they're being held ransom right now
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.080]   with the national endowment for the arts and the TV.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.520]   So--
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.360]   Yeah, all those who say in Europe,
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.320]   you should have a BBC.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.800]   I said imagine a BBC under the present regime.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.280]   Right.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:07.720]   Right.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.120]   No, I was going to start playing.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.840]   So we need to--
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.640]   I guess what it is.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.920]   People need to support journalism.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.360]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, Stacey.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   No, I was going to say I've talked to a couple journalists
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.920]   because they're friends of mine at various publications.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.720]   And it's actually a little disturbing because there are some who say that
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.800]   their publishers are cracking down on their columns.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.640]   There's a couple who've had headlines changed or stories
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.560]   rejiggered to be less antagonistic towards the current.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.360]   I see that happening.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.640]   And it--
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.280]   Well, me too, it is happening.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:42.680]   Right.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.560]   And that's actually--
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:50.680]   I'm very curious because I've never actually worked in a very political area.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.160]   And at Gigo Home, our focus was--
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.760]   you know, the consumer comes first.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.600]   That was always like how we wrote--
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.360]   Yeah, we're going to happen at Gigo Home.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.320]   I know.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:01.560]   We--
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.440]   [chuckles]
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.640]   What a mistake.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.120]   I will say--
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.240]   No, it's kids.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.480]   And Fortune, I had one headline changed,
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.280]   but I could kind of understand where they were coming from.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:10.520]   So--
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.240]   No, I think that's all mallec.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.360]   The consumer first?
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.080]   Yes.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.440]   That's--
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.160]   That's when you--
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.040]   And that's what you need.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:28.440]   You need a leader who says this is our value.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.320]   These are our values.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   And these are the values we're going to adhere to, regardless of clickbait.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:39.480]   But you might do it at your peril from a business point of view, I don't know.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:45.320]   Anyway, I--
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.480]   That's not political.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.160]   That's media commentary, okay?
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.840]   But file under media commentary.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.360]   Let's take a break and then we're going to talk about fun things like robots.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.280]   Robots.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.000]   Robots.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.600]   That's scary robots.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.720]   Oh, bots.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.680]   Robots.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.240]   Robots.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.200]   Robots.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.800]   I have a robot.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.880]   I don't think we want to talk about Android because we've got this great show.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:16.680]   The night before, every Tuesday night with Jason Howell and Florence Ion and Ron Richards
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.640]   called all about Android and they really cover it pretty darn well.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.920]   So I don't see anything really pressing.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:28.200]   I do want to do Stacy and you can help us with this more coverage of Echo and its ilk.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.680]   [clicking]
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.000]   Right?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.360]   I have a really good new Echo skill that I'm going to share with you later.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.440]   Ooh, is it Starbucks?
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.120]   Better than Starbucks.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.840]   Okay.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:44.520]   Is it a hit workout because I really want a high intensity workout skill?
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.000]   I--
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.600]   There are some very good ones on there.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.760]   Haven't you found Google Home has a new one too?
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.480]   That's very nice.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.120]   I like it.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:50.600]   Okay.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.080]   Russell.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.520]   Stacy wants to work out for seven minutes a day.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.680]   No, but I did the seven minute workout.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.560]   That's not exciting.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.160]   I want like a 25 minute hit workout.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.400]   Okay.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:01.880]   Keep going.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.880]   Well, we'll find one for you.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.280]   Chatroom.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.560]   There's your assignment.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.320]   Please.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.360]   Please.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:08.840]   [laughing]
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:08.920]   Please.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:15.880]   And God is unverified at Facebook.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.240]   [laughing]
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.960]   Oh, the Amazon Echo is available in the UK.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.600]   Chatroom.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.920]   Oh, good news, but not all the skills.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.400]   Nah, I don't know about that.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.720]   Our show today brought to actually by a very cute little robot.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.280]   I met the other day named Curry.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.000]   And Curry is just the cutest darn thing about knee high.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.360]   I really--
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.360]   I'm starting to think that the whole premise behind Curry,
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.760]   and how I understand Curry is that this will be your first robot.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.640]   Like your kids, 20 years from now, I'll say, oh yeah.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.720]   I remember when we got a robot.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.400]   It was so cute.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.600]   Curry is--
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.400]   Kids love Curry.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.000]   I've seen kids interact with Curry.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.160]   Curry is just a couple of feet high.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.400]   He or she, I don't know.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.600]   I'm saying she because she looks like Rosie from the Jetsons a little bit.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.240]   I thought you said it was a he.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.240]   They say in the copy that it's a he,
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.080]   but then I asked them when I went down and I said,
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.200]   I really feel like calling it a her.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.320]   They say, well, we just--
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.160]   Whatever, you get to choose.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.120]   Curry though, and they did some really interesting things.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.960]   In fact, they have two T-shirts.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.400]   One that says Curry does,
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.920]   and one that says Curry doesn't,
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.800]   because they very consciously decided to not make Curry look humanoid exactly.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.320]   No limbs.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:29.880]   It doesn't walk.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.160]   It rolls around.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.760]   It doesn't have a voice.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.800]   Now, it can read to you and sing and make music,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.640]   but it doesn't talk to you.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.200]   It has distinct chirps for yes and no.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.480]   It shakes its head.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.720]   Its eyes follow you around.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.440]   There's a wonderful idle mode where Curry will just join it,
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.960]   just stand there while you're talking,
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.520]   and she'll just look at whoever's talking and then look at the--
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.960]   It's so cute.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.800]   Pretty soon, you feel like there's a person.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.520]   This is a person.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.960]   In it's so--
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.200]   I think this is the kid's first experience of Curry.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.840]   Now that Curry does do some very useful things.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.480]   For instance, you can have Curry come and wake you up in the morning,
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.440]   start playing your favorite newscast or podcast.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.240]   Have it start this week in Google,
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.760]   and then you could say, "Curry, follow me."
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.920]   And then as you go about your morning routine,
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.520]   you go cook the bacon and eggs,
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.160]   go get on the treadmill, whatever,
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.720]   it'll--
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.800]   She'll follow you around and continue to read to you.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.800]   She does not fall downstairs.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.760]   She's smart enough not to do that.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.200]   In fact, she's mapped the whole house,
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.960]   and you can name the kitchen, the living room.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.320]   So you can say, "Curry, go to the kitchen."
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.760]   "Curry, go to the living room.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.560]   See what the dogs do."
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.480]   Curry has in her right eye there.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.400]   She has a very good camera.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.960]   Would you pair with your phone so you can see what she's seeing?
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.640]   If there is a loud noise in the house,
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.480]   she'll go investigate and send you images.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.760]   She recognizes you, different people.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.160]   She recognizes different sounds.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   You can always see the saved videos and photos
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.240]   Curry has taken so you can see what happened earlier today.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.680]   But I think part of it is just that she's really cute,
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.160]   and it's like, I'm telling you, your kids will say,
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.920]   "Yeah, we had our first robot,
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.040]   you know, and round about 2017.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.000]   I remember when we got her."
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.920]   Now, Curry's not out yet,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   but you can go to the Curry's website,
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.960]   "Hey, Curry, h-e-y-k-u-r-i.com,"
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.560]   and put down a refundable deposit for a pre-order if you want.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.840]   No commitment, just a $100 refundable deposit.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.040]   Curry will be $5.99 remaining at time of shipment.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.000]   That's excluding tax and shipping.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.560]   And they think it'll be later this year,
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.760]   maybe September, October.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.840]   I know Curry was at CES.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.600]   Many of you saw Curry at CES.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.680]   And I know that they say he,
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.240]   but you can call her she if you want.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.120]   After meeting Curry and spending some time with her,
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   A, I fell in love.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.240]   I mean, it's just, I forgot.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.120]   But B, I really think it's a girl.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.560]   Maybe that's because I fell in love with her.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.960]   I don't know.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.640]   Maybe you shouldn't anthropomorphize your robots.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.200]   Look at her.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.120]   She's getting her eyes blink.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.200]   She looks around.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.360]   You pat her on the head and she looks up at you.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:00.840]   She does.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.640]   She has a heartlight.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.280]   Her chirps.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:02.520]   Yep.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.880]   She's a heartlight that glows can glow different colors.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.600]   She's very surprising to communicate,
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.640]   but I think it's interesting to decide not to make her too humanoid,
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.640]   because that would be a little creepy kind of.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.600]   Like the latest Boston Dynamics robot?
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:18.840]   Yes.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.200]   Exactly.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.280]   Now you know what I'm talking about.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.520]   Now you know, if you want to know more and pre-order,
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.760]   go to haycurry.com, h-e-y-k-u-r-i.com.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   Curry is from Mayfield Robotics,
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.400]   and they're really neat guys, really smart.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.920]   I want to know what your cats are going to do.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.040]   What my cat would do with that?
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.480]   They've tested it with pets and the pets seem to like it.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.840]   Really?
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.120]   And you can actually,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.560]   it's kind of, you can talk to your pets.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.040]   So it's interesting.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.000]   I think the pet really,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.240]   I'll tell you what, we just lost our dog a couple of weeks ago.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:53.720]   I know.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.360]   It was very sad.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.000]   And the house seemed really kind of dead and quiet.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.200]   And what it was missing was that presence.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.440]   And Curry's kind of like that.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.320]   I mean, she doesn't replace Aussie,
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.800]   but well, except that she kind of in some ways does,
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.160]   because it's not like you're not alone.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.800]   Like there's a presence in the house.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.000]   And she wanders around.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.560]   She interacts with the house.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.960]   She follow you?
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.760]   If you say so,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.600]   yeah, but she also can just patrol or wander or just wander.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.720]   And she has a little charger.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.200]   She'll walk up to the charger when she gets low and charge yourself.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.120]   It's kind of sweet.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.200]   And it's easier than a dog in some ways.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.960]   Well, yeah.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.800]   And,
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.600]   and no robot mess.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.880]   Anyway, I didn't mean to bring up Aussie.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.680]   I'm sad now, but hey, Curry.com, H-E-Y-K-U-R-I.com.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.560]   We have really cool.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.680]   We're going to get one as soon as we can.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.960]   I just will have one in the studio to wander around,
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.320]   which will be kind of funny.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.440]   She can get over all the way.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.880]   Can you get the camera?
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.720]   Can you can you?
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.920]   You can broadcast into the camera?
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.160]   You can broadcast Curry's, a Curry view.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.840]   Well, that's cool.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.040]   What is she going to do in the studio?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.880]   Whatever she wants.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.000]   OK.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.480]   You know, I don't know.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.360]   We'll figure, you know, you could maybe just be the Curry view.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.520]   The Curry view?
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.240]   No, no, I don't know.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.520]   Now, one thing she's not going to do is do this.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.640]   I am scared to death of the new Boston dynamics.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.680]   So we've seen their dogs, the robotic dog that walks,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.760]   and we've seen the, so this leaked out the other day.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.880]   This is Boston Dynamics.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.360]   This was at an investor's presentation,
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.800]   and somebody pulled out a camera phone and took pictures of it.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.840]   There's the humanoid, and you could see these are kind of creepy,
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.760]   these walking, and there's a reason why the dogs and the humanoid shapes,
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.360]   because they can get over terrain that a wheeled vehicle can't.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.000]   But at the presentation, they said,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.880]   there's no reason we can't have robots with wheels,
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.040]   and they showed this.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.160]   Oh my God.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.560]   It is the, it is like the combination of that.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.400]   And lots of plastic with wheels, and it's probably faster.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.920]   It's super fast.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.280]   Oh God, this is so scary.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.440]   It can run lots faster than you can.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:20.920]   Keep watching, because it can also jump over obstacles.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.640]   And this is, by the way, this is autonomous.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.960]   This is not remote controlled.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.640]   It's a figure skating.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.080]   This is a company Google Briefly owned.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:42.280]   I think that they just divested of it because of the defense contracts and Google didn't want to,
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.360]   I can't remember the D, but they did not.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.000]   Because it's evil.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.040]   Because it may be because they...
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:46.680]   Maybe it could be lying.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.880]   I think they realized that this probably wouldn't be a good thing for,
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.720]   watch this, look how fast this thing goes.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.000]   This can whizzle long, jump over things.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.800]   Wow.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.760]   This is your worst nightmare.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.080]   Anyway, thank you to the investor who...
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.520]   [laughs]
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.200]   I don't know what this slide means.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.160]   Approach harmony, computer, robot, physical world,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.960]   in this double, lot headed lines between each.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.920]   I don't know, I don't know.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.680]   It's making me nervous.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.800]   They call it handle because it can handle things.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.120]   You know, physically pick up things.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.680]   Big dog, that's the scary one.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.800]   Big dogs is scary one.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.560]   Oh, Boston, my name is still a wholly owned subsidiary of Google.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.880]   Oh, I thought they were going to divest.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.240]   Oh good, I guess.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.760]   Hey, we were speculating, we mentioned last week that Hugo Barra had left Xiaomi.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.840]   And we just missed the news.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.800]   We just missed the news.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.920]   Shortly after we left the air, we found out he's joining Facebook as VP of VR.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:56.040]   And there's a VR look at Hugo and Mark.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.440]   That's not creepy at all.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.640]   Sitting in the Facebook headquarters.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.080]   So that was right after we got off the air,
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.840]   they announced that Hugo Barra, who everybody loved.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   He was that great demo guy for Anne, right?
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.960]   We just, he's a great guy.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:17.160]   And I think this is a smart move on Google's part to get somebody to be the face,
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.560]   not Palmer Lucky to see.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.800]   [laughs]
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.840]   Face Evaculous.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.640]   Everybody should be there.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.800]   Would you live on his island?
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.480]   Really, that's the question we should be asking.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.400]   I would not live on Palmer Lucky's island.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.600]   No, I would add either.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.720]   Hugo Barra's island.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.760]   Yes, I would.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.640]   It'd be great.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.360]   There'd be tapas.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.720]   So I keep on getting every single media company I talk to.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.600]   So it's the same thing.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:47.720]   VR, just, and I say, well, I don't know, Google and Facebook are investing a hell of a lot.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.480]   And then the media people say,
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   "Really?"
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.640]   I just Google and Facebook, the NBA is going to do a VR 360 degree
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.120]   game of the week every week.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.440]   You can watch it with your Google Cardboard,
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.360]   your Gear VR, or your Google Daydream.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.200]   The next game is February 7th.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.720]   Trailblazers at Mavericks.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   So remember 3D?
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.520]   Yeah, whatever happened to that.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.080]   There was a lot of investment.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.760]   I don't know if there was this much investment,
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.400]   but I don't think the market was as frothy either then.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.600]   And it may be that we just haven't hit a tipping point and we're about to.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:32.760]   So I'm not, but I got to say VR to me still has yet to be compelling in a way that-
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.240]   You know what?
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.080]   I am completely in agreement with you, Stacey.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.160]   And I am equally, oppositely bullish about Augment in reality.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.960]   Oh, there was some augmented reality news.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.840]   What was it?
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.760]   So VR, you're sealed into a visor and you can't see anything.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.320]   Right.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.000]   And I think there's some merit to say like a VR basketball game.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.760]   There are going to be NFL highlights in the Super Bowl in virtual reality as well
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.200]   for Google Cardboard or Daydream.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.680]   I think there's a lot to be said for that.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.360]   Football game is a really good example.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.120]   When you watch a football game, you're forced to watch whatever perspective or view
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.400]   the director gives you.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.520]   But many is the time-
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.320]   Well, that's one of the reasons I like to go to a football game in person.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.120]   If I could only just get as close as the cameras do,
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.560]   because many is the time you'd like to see what the backfield is doing
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.640]   while the quarterback has the ball or, you know,
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.600]   how are they defending it?
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.080]   And you don't get the chance to because the director,
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.240]   so the ability to look around is great.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:32.120]   So I think there's some uses for 360 degree video, maybe more so than virtual reality.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.560]   Gamers like VR, I guess.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.760]   Yes.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.280]   Snap.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:43.960]   That's, Snap is doing, the information is reporting that Snap is doing augmented reality
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:49.800]   on it's kind of advancing its spectacles technology to add augmented reality,
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.760]   which I thought was kind of-
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:58.520]   Oh, because I have this
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.160]   I'm trying to get into the story, but, you know,
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.720]   I bought a subscription to the information and by golly,
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.880]   I have literally never been able to use it.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.080]   I should probably email them.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:07.880]   Call Jessica.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.400]   I can, because I use it.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.120]   I bought it.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:10.600]   I love it.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.200]   I love it too.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:17.240]   I just work my way around it because my subscription doesn't work,
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.000]   even though I've subscribed.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:19.560]   Well, sure.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.960]   You can read it on my-
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.720]   I'll read it on your screen now.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.200]   Actually, Carson doesn't have my login,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.840]   so he's only seeing the short version.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.840]   Snap is working on smarter lenses.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.240]   Oh, so this will replace the existing ones.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.400]   They bought a company called CImage that does augmented reality.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.000]   And you know, they're going to go public within the next month,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.360]   so they're going to have a lot of cash to lay out on something like this.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   And I would guess that given the threat that Instagram's starting to be,
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.280]   that they're going to want to step it up.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.040]   In a way, augmented reality is nothing new to Snapchat.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.800]   I mean, all of those faces and stuff, that's augmented reality, right?
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.040]   Sure.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.040]   Oh my god.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.160]   You could put filters over people in real life.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.040]   And what happened?
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.200]   Hangouts took all of that ability away.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.800]   Stupid.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.480]   Stupid.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.600]   The youngs, they like that stuff.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.640]   I like that stuff.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.680]   It's the funnest thing.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:24.120]   Snap has already released ad products that incorporate scannable,
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.880]   snap-only QR codes.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.520]   Snap to unlock ads, let people scan a QR code,
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.800]   which unlocks hidden features like a lens or a video.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.600]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.080]   That's, this is some of the new stuff out of Snap Labs.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:44.760]   I, I, uh, I like Snapchat.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.760]   I don't know if their monetization strategy is working as well as, say, Facebooks.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.400]   Well, that's a pretty high bar.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.320]   What are you doing?
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:55.960]   Instagram.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.360]   Instagram, you got an ad every 10th image.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.640]   Okay.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.520]   I was going to say.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.160]   Snapchat, like the Discover page has become a garbage page, right?
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.960]   And so I, I wonder.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.080]   Try to fix it.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.280]   Yeah, I know they're banning the kind of link-baity,
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.000]   uh, you know, images.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   Cause what happened is they changed it from just dots,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.360]   which obviously wasn't a super engaging feature.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.520]   So now the Discover tab is images.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.160]   It's like a little magazine, like a Pinterest or something.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.640]   But for a while, these images and they're, okay, here's one.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:35.960]   Is being a nudist good for your health and there's a half naked day, right?
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.600]   So that's, you know, and somebody had link bait where it was like a
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.680]   woman in a bikini and the story was about a guy.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.600]   I mean, it's like, so they've, I think that Snapchat has toned this down.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.160]   Are you a GG or a Kindle?
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.520]   Mm.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:56.040]   So, but, and I suppose this works with the youngens, but, uh, meet America's.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.160]   Are you a GG or a Kindle could be a legit story?
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:11:59.560]   Could be.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.600]   Or a JIT quiz.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.640]   Or an excuse just to have more pictures of GG and Kindle.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.320]   On the other hand, I think sending it as a messaging,
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.240]   but it's harder to monetize this stuff.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.400]   I mean, one way they do it is with, uh, monetizing lenses, right?
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.720]   You have, you know, world over here.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.240]   Let me do a world of Warcraft lens or something like that, right?
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.880]   So that, that, uh, that's an ad.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.840]   Let's see if they have any paid lenses here.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.680]   I like the Easter Bunny one.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.520]   That's good.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.440]   You can't really see it.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:30.760]   Sorry.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.760]   These are the sorts of things I do with my 10 year old and I am.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.240]   It's fun.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.640]   But how do you monetize 10 year olds?
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.680]   Well, exactly.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.680]   That's what I mean.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.160]   I think that.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.120]   Club Penguin is shutting down, by the way.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:44.600]   What?
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.040]   That's, that's, yes.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.080]   That was like the most success story of the decade.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.040]   Uh, does the American girl shut down?
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.960]   My daughter was beside herself.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.720]   Wait, American girl shut down.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.440]   What?
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.160]   No, no, no, no.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.560]   They had a, oh, so, look at Stacy.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.440]   No, no, don't worry Stacy.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:00.760]   Don't worry.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.000]   It's okay.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.320]   It's okay.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   It's okay.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.960]   Look at Stacy.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.680]   What about me?
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.480]   And no, they, they had a, they had a special, a safe club for girls there.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.560]   They had a social space.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.760]   Okay.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.560]   Yeah, and they shut it down.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.440]   And so, so, you know, this, how do you club Penguin?
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.640]   This was the show at the time.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.880]   Club Penguin was huge, wasn't it?
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.320]   Yeah, it was.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.280]   But the replacing it was something.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:22.840]   That's mobile.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.120]   It's, it, well, Club Penguin's now becoming like a mobile app or something.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:26.920]   Disney buy it?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.080]   Disney bought Club Penguin, yes.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.240]   And so if they're shutting it down, it will be to replace it with,
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.280]   you know, mobile makes sense, right?
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:36.520]   Why?
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:37.960]   Here's the problem.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.680]   And it's a big problem.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.680]   If you're under, if you're 13 or under, right?
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:47.480]   That, you know, the, uh, the, uh, copper prevents companies from gathering information about you.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.160]   And that's obviously who Club Penguin is aimed at.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.760]   But that was, that was always an issue for them.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.640]   That's an issue, you know, Disney understands Coppa, Coppa, however you say it.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.120]   Oh, yes.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.400]   So they've, they're just discontinuing the virtual reality world.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.560]   That it's not a question to me is if a, if a child has a membership in this thing and feels
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.080]   associated with it, are they losing that?
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.000]   Or does it carry over into this new thing?
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:15.960]   It says waddle on.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.920]   We've decided to discontinue the current Club Penguin game on desktop and mobile on March 29th.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.800]   See, that's when you start a community, you have, you have some obligation to that community.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:27.320]   Tell us.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.120]   Cause you kids.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:28.680]   Some kids.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   Okay.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   But, I agree.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.720]   15 year olds who were excited five years ago when the Club Penguin was happening,
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.800]   they're probably not checking it.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   So, I mean, that's true, but.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.520]   And I don't mean maybe they have it.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.200]   Oh, they got bigger problems.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.200]   But, but you're right.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.760]   Cause it says here Club Penguin Island coming to mobile March, 2017.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.600]   So you could just just go mobile with it, I guess.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.560]   But, you know, how many kids?
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.920]   I mean, my child is in fifth grade.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.560]   So she's 10. She doesn't have a smartphone.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.920]   She might get one next year.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.200]   It's unclear.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:10.520]   Right.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.880]   I don't think so like.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   That's a really good point, Stacey.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.080]   So, and she can only have my phone on certain occasions,
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080]   not in their, their few and far between.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.680]   And somebody in the chat room says,
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.480]   Leek says, why would they close Club Penguin before opening the alternative?
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.600]   Wouldn't you want to kind of run them simultaneously for a little bit?
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.560]   Transfer people over.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.400]   Create a transition for them.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:44.200]   As of today, God's page has been unverified by Facebook.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.640]   I had trouble understanding this one a little bit.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.360]   I put it up there.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.320]   They verified God?
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   It was too good a headline.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:59.160]   Apparently, God, God was taking sides.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.240]   In the Trump.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.760]   Wouldn't you think God would do that?
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.960]   Trump Muslim debate.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.000]   God had an opinion.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.280]   If God didn't stop Hitler, he's not going to stop Trump.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.000]   Oh man.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   True.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.280]   But God can at least complain, can he?
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:18.680]   Or she?
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:24.200]   I'm not even going here.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.480]   So you can order.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.840]   So now I can order Starbucks from my echo.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.480]   Is that right?
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.440]   Yes.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.720]   Sorry.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.120]   I'm back.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.160]   So how does that work?
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.760]   You have to have the Starbucks app.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.800]   And then you basically tell the echo.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.400]   You say, hey echo.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.960]   Order me a Venti, Grande, whatever flavor our size rather.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:52.200]   And it will actually handle things like a half calf,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.440]   soy latte with macchiato.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.320]   Or I'm trying to think of the most of not just Starbucks orders,
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.400]   but I don't order them.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.440]   So I don't know.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:07.240]   Anyway, the point is Starbucks was having an issue because everybody was using its mobile app,
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.880]   which was good except they would go to Starbucks and they'd be like,
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.560]   they'd put their order in and then they'd waited the counter to pick it up.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.960]   And so it moved its line backlog all the way to the counter.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.400]   Plus they still had the people who were coming in line and people were getting kind of pissy
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.600]   because they're up here.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.640]   Excuse me, I've already ordered on my echo.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.280]   I will say, so it's not common in Austin for people to really do this,
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.040]   but when I was in San Francisco, I was just like floored.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.080]   I was like nobody.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.240]   I looked in and like the line was super short.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.120]   So I was like, sweet.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.520]   You know, there was like one person.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.120]   So I'm like, I read I'm getting a coffee.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.320]   We'll be with you in half an hour.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.520]   Exactly.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.600]   I ordered my coffee and then like 14 people came and walked in and picked up their coffees.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.240]   Or maybe they'll get your coffees and I was like,
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.120]   know what that's like, Stacy?
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.160]   You know what that's like?
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.360]   I can empathize with you because that's what happens in Chipotle.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.000]   You could have ordered some of that.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.720]   Just take your at the head of the line and then they've got a list like that in front of you.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.800]   They got to make instead of you who's standing right there staring at the black beans.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.080]   That's not fair.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.680]   That would be tough.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.760]   I still like the idea.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.800]   So I can order it.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.440]   I can get in the car, go get it and be here all in one swell poop.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.280]   Or you can get a coffee pot.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.720]   All right.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.560]   I'm going to give you another Alexa.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.200]   I mean, Echo.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:32.520]   Sorry.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.040]   Echo school.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.520]   I should just name it computer, right?
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.560]   That would never set it off.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.880]   So that was my challenge to Kevin, but he didn't do it this week.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.040]   So to rename his echo to a computer.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.520]   Yeah, because he was complaining like it would be terrible.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.680]   So was it bad for you?
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.680]   No, it's funny because it's in my office and I was doing the tech guy show.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.600]   So I probably said the word a few times.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:03.800]   No, I think you have to say it like more like intentionally computer.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:13.080]   So what you need to do is go to your app, the echo app and enable a skill called DITTY.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.040]   D-I-T-T-Y.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:14.600]   Have you seen this one?
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.560]   Oh, I made it about this.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.920]   Yes.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.000]   I don't want this, but keep it like.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:26.120]   So then you turn on DITTY and you say anything you want and DITTY will turn it to a song.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.440]   They have fast song, slow songs and football songs.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.120]   Here is an example.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.000]   And by the way, after it makes a song, it says, "Okay, you want me to share that?"
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:33.720]   And I said, "Yes."
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.160]   And they just put it right up on Twitter.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.640]   So now I can tweet songs.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.720]   Oh, God help us.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.240]   So Leo's Twitter.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.040]   God help us.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.720]   He's gone from hating it to actually actively making Twitter even worse.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.680]   I'm polluting it.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   Well, don't you want to pollute the things you hate?
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.280]   So here's my, this is, I did this for Lisa because it was her birthday on Sunday.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.600]   Oh, you don't have my audio.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.840]   Thank goodness.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.000]   Carsten, lose the plug.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.720]   Oh, too bad.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.400]   You're not going to get to hear this fine song.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.160]   I want to hear the fine song.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.760]   Well, Carsten hasn't pushed the button.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.600]   Because I've blabbed him.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.880]   Carsten?
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.120]   Carsten likes Jeff better than he likes me.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.520]   Wait, but what about me?
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.960]   Huh?
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.160]   Yeah, because yeah, Carsten.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.320]   Oh, yeah, wait a minute.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.520]   Let me turn it up here.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.080]   There it is.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.120]   Now you got my audio.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:26.840]   What's your fault?
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.800]   It was my fault.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.120]   Ready?
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.880]   Hold your ears.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.600]   It did that.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.000]   You thought Twitter couldn't get worse.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.960]   I'll wait the moment when the president of the United States discovers this.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.000]   Oh, man.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:55.400]   You know what?
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.880]   I want to create an alternate, uh, Diddy Trump.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.360]   Or Piddy D. Trump.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.800]   And I'll just take it.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.600]   He was, oh, can you take his existing tweet and make it into a song?
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.800]   Can you just take any?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   Do it.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.280]   Do it.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:06.280]   You can do it.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:06.760]   You can do it.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.880]   Go cut and paste.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.920]   Cut and paste one of his tweets.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.960]   Oh, you don't have to cut and paste it.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.920]   You do it verbally.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.880]   Shall I start doing that?
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.160]   Make a new, make a new account?
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:15.720]   Diddy Trump.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.760]   Take.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.960]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.520]   Let's take a, let's take something that long.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.080]   I don't know if you can do something that long.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:21.560]   Sweet.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.480]   No, wait, oh, somebody has to bring,
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.440]   John is John around.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.680]   Bring me my, uh, my echo.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.760]   It's, uh, you have to unplug it.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.760]   It's under the desk and all that's in the corner.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.240]   And then we'll have to plug it in and it has to wake up.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.080]   So it's going to be a while before we can do this, but.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:41.480]   I got, so just Nancy Pelosi and fake tears, Chuck Schumer held a rally.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:41.960]   I love it.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.920]   And their mic didn't work.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.200]   That would all be, that's all I needed.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.800]   I could probably do that much.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.120]   So what you do is you say, you know, ask Diddy or how,
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.640]   I can't remember what the trigger word is.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.800]   Hello, Diddy, make a song, Diddy something.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.160]   And then you say, whatever you say next, just say it.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.120]   You don't sing it or anything.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.720]   You say it then turns into a song.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.680]   Or the failing New York Times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.800]   That would be a good one.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.600]   That'd be a nice song.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.520]   All right, we're going to, uh,
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.400]   I'm having curry get me my echo.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   I thought that was cute.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.920]   I was like, uh, we have found a use.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.840]   As soon as curry gets back with my echo, I will.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.080]   To her head though.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.920]   Yeah, she's not going to really be able to carry it.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.440]   Researchers.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.120]   You don't think she, oh, go on.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:32.600]   No, please.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.320]   While you were on.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.040]   I was going to say stick a tray in there that comes out, you know.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.160]   See, I said that or, you know, and they said, no, you know,
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.480]   we really don't want to make it do anything too useful.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.520]   Because.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.760]   Because a $700 robot shouldn't be too useful.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.800]   It shouldn't be too useful.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.880]   It's just, it's just a companion robot.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.280]   I want to get, I want to see if I can get it on a plane with me.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.000]   Get to buy a seat.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.320]   No, it's my companion robot.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:22:59.640]   Oh, no.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:22:59.960]   All right.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.800]   So what you do is you get one of those jackets for it.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.600]   Say no, no, no, this is my therapy robot therapy robot.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.840]   So while you're on, uh, skills, uh, I have one on there for the Google home,
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.800]   which is really kind of neat.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.080]   Oh, let's hear it.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.200]   Look it up.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.080]   So you can tell the Google home.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.720]   I put my passport in the upper drawer and then you can ask, remember it.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.160]   That is a good skill.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:25.560]   Nice.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.000]   Jeff, it's like you listened in on the podcast this morning,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   or you read the scene, that story about it.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.840]   But yes, you guys mentioned it already.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.360]   We tried it.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:34.840]   Yes.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.480]   And it works.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.000]   It, it works.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.720]   So I don't want to step on the Stacy on IOT podcast,
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.600]   because that's a wonderful show, but I would like to do more echo skills.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.640]   I think that's kind of fun.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.000]   We can bring lots of echo skills.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.400]   I actually was thinking about doing an echo podcast.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.400]   Oh, sorry.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:51.720]   But that is.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.240]   You want to do an echo podcast.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:53.800]   Do it here.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.320]   Can you plug it in?
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   It.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.520]   We're going to see what we can do here.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.320]   We got my echo.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.560]   It takes a little while, as you know, to, to wake up and smell the roses.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.760]   Also, uh, I put on there, there's new wooden and leather Google home covers.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.960]   I did see that.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.600]   Leather.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.040]   Why would you let it?
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:14.520]   Leather.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.120]   Okay.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.640]   All right.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.120]   Well, I'm driving the car that would be my daughter's car.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.400]   It has a plastic steering wheel.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.880]   And I'm telling you, I understand now why you want a leather player.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.680]   That there's nice.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.040]   Oh, would look good.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:26.520]   Look at that.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.960]   Would you see?
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.280]   So can I get that from my existing one?
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.200]   Yeah, just a cover.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.320]   I have to say I still, I have it.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:35.800]   I have a.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.240]   Google home sitting right next to my echo.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.200]   I still use echo more.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:47.800]   So what did I do the other day that I was like, holy cow, Google home is so much better.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.840]   Because I talked to them on a regular basis.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.960]   Uh, okay.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.680]   I'm not going to remember.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:02.840]   It's, I mean, it's really good at, you know, asking questions of facts,
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:03.320]   the knowledge.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.200]   No, it was.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.080]   It was a search thing.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.880]   But you can also have it play songs that are actually, like instead of saying the exact name
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:16.680]   of the song, you can say, Hey, play, you know, the theme song from that Kevin Bacon movie in the 80s.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.080]   And it'll play you foot loose.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.440]   So I haven't tried that.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.880]   Actually, that may not work, but I have been equally general with it.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.640]   And it's, it's like, Oh yeah, sure.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.800]   So all right.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.200]   Should I let me, let me try this here, wait a minute.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.560]   Um, sorry, I can't find the answer to the question I heard.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.280]   Okay.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.640]   So what, what, what should the tweet be?
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.680]   Uh, Oh, okay.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:43.400]   Hold on.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.360]   Oh, give me a good one.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.640]   Should I, uh, do the one with the, I got it.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.160]   Well, where's the dudes one?
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.040]   I got to find the dudes one.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.760]   Oh, here we go.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.640]   Um,
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.800]   No, that's not good.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:25:59.960]   Okay.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.200]   Hold on.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.680]   Hold on.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.000]   Hold on.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.720]   I got what I got.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.400]   I might just have it send in the feds.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:16.120]   Uh, actually this is an app you can also get on Google on your Android or app store.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.240]   And so now it, so now they're vatted a, uh, that's pretty cool.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.560]   And echo command as well.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.360]   When did Mark Zuckerberg start wearing suits?
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.000]   When he had to testify in Dallas, Texas.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.560]   Or we meet Chinese.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.080]   Okay.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.280]   Cause there's a couple pictures that aren't from him in Dallas wearing a suit.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.720]   And I was suddenly like, what happened?
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.480]   So, oh, the CEO summit and Lima Peru.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.040]   Oh, there you go.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:44.600]   There you go.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.160]   Okay.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:45.560]   Sorry.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.920]   Okay.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.760]   Hey, computer.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.560]   Ask Diddy to make a fast song.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.040]   It doesn't look like you have enabled the Diddy skill to.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.960]   Go to the skills store in the Alexa app and search for Diddy.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.240]   Do you have to enable it on every, I thought you could enable it on your account.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.920]   Do you have to enable it on every device?
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   I know.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   I have all my skills on the account, but maybe is this one on a different account?
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.440]   I hope not.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.360]   I certainly hope not.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:18.760]   Let's see.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:26.520]   Did you, did you tell it play Diddy or use Diddy to make a song or whatever its code words are?
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.440]   Yeah, I did the right thing.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.520]   Phrase?
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.080]   Phrase.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.920]   The phrase that pays.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.280]   Yeah, skills are maybe somebody in my home.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:40.760]   Maybe at least.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.840]   Now I'm thinking somebody in my home disabled it.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.120]   That's what I think happened.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.840]   Oh, man.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.160]   Okay.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.960]   Hey, computer asked Diddy to make a fast song.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.640]   What would you like me to sing?
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.320]   What should I say?
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:10.680]   The feeling at New York Times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.720]   The feeling New York Times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.120]   Here you go.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:27.400]   You can't really understand it.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:27.960]   Huh?
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.840]   Oh, you can't.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.360]   So all songs in the public domain are just doomed.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.640]   Okay, I got another one.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.280]   Make some changes.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.320]   Make some changes.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.280]   I'm going to change the music.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.320]   I promise our administration will always have your back.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.760]   We will always be with you.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.720]   Try saying things like replay this Diddy.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.920]   Change the song.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.200]   Change the message.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.920]   Save it, share it, or make a new Diddy.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.600]   What would you like me to do?
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.480]   Change the song.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.120]   Do you want a fast, slow, or a football song?
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.240]   Football song.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:57.720]   That's right.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:04.680]   Here you go.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:15.240]   I guess you have to really choose your words carefully.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.200]   All you do is...
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:27.640]   Anyway, it's just a silly, very skilled.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.200]   What is...
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.480]   Oh, look at that.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.280]   Comcast.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.080]   We could be too busy.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.240]   Share it, or make some changes?
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:35.720]   Cancel.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.240]   Sorry?
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:37.800]   Can I help you?
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.600]   So, comcast.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.240]   Oh, no!
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.920]   No!
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.480]   No way!
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.480]   Alexis, so rude.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.240]   That was really played.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.920]   But, comcast is now...
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.360]   You can use your Roku as a cable box replacement,
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.120]   but you have to pay Comcast to do so.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.240]   Oh, I got to rent my Roku from Comcast.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.360]   That's only if you want to use it instead of your cable box, though.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.400]   Well, the FCC made them do cable cards,
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.440]   but that's interesting.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.560]   So, I can tell them,
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.360]   well, I'm going to do that and see what happens.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.320]   But, if Roku makes a very good cable box, I don't think so.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.160]   So...
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:17.560]   Oh!
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.920]   Look at this.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.280]   This is my buddy.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.200]   I bet it is, because it's a Scoopy Scoop.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.240]   Oh, it's not my buddy.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.280]   Okay, never mind.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.360]   It's Variety's reporting this, so...
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.320]   See, Variety knows.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.800]   Yeah, I was thinking it was my buddy, Yanko,
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.160]   but it's not my buddy, Yanko.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.000]   Hey, computer.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.840]   Ask Titty to make a slow song.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.640]   What would you like me to sing?
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.520]   Make America great again.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.520]   [laughs]
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.000]   Here you go.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.120]   I take it back.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.720]   This skill is terrible.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:54.920]   It's awful.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.600]   See, this is why I did not like the skill.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.520]   And, by the way, that's not a slow song.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.120]   Would you like to save this, Ditty?
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.880]   Share it or make some changes?
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.840]   Stop.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.720]   Thanks for using Ditty.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:10.920]   [laughs]
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.360]   Oh, she sounds so sad.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   Yeah, she sounded disappointment.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.640]   Yeah, she does.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.120]   Sorry.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:16.840]   Okay.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.560]   So, more details on the Roku box thing.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.640]   Do they say how much they're going to charge or...?
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:25.880]   They will get...
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.080]   Hold on.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.560]   Net charge is $7.45 a month.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.040]   Oh!
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:30.360]   Let's see.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:30.840]   Hold on.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.040]   That's such a rip off.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.640]   During the beta program,
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.000]   Expedited TV users will not pay a fee to use the Roku app,
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:43.400]   but they will level additional outlet charges for connected Roku devices once the app is officially
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:43.880]   launched.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:44.520]   Oh, how much is that?
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.720]   Currently, the operators' additional outlet service
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.160]   piece per set top box are $9.95 per month.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.720]   Customers using their own equipment,
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:59.720]   such as a Tivo receive a $2.50 credit resulting in a net $7.45 per per chart.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.000]   That's what I pay for my Tivo, yeah.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:09.160]   So, a Comcast rep said the company is "evaluating our additional outlet policies."
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.000]   Now, here's the good news.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:19.080]   The data that you use on the Roku does not count against your terabyte data cap.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:24.200]   That's such good news because they freaking need the data caps, right?
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:24.440]   No.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.200]   We're already screwing you, so we're not going to screw you twice is what they're saying.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.840]   Oh, I was going to say it's something awful.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:33.000]   OK.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.720]   Hey, did you see?
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.960]   Did you guys see that Americans are eating so much bacon that reserves her to 50 year low?
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.000]   Bacon reserves.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   Now, there's this is good news and bad news.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.680]   I mean, of course, that's bad news.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.920]   But the good news is we have bacon reserves.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.720]   Just like the maple syrup reserves.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.400]   There are maple syrup reserves too.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:00.120]   So the canate remember in Canada, how the maple syrup reserves were pilfered a couple
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.880]   years ago was like the great maple syrup.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.600]   Oh, that's right.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:07.160]   So here's what we should start a breakfast ETF.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:16.840]   So USA Today says, "Nations bacon reserves hit a 50 year low as prices rise."
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.920]   And they've even got video of bacon.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:24.840]   On the list of problems facing the United States, a bacon shortage wasn't supposed to be one
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:25.720]   in dramatic view.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.240]   According to the US Department of Agriculture, the inventory for frozen pork.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:33.640]   OK, New York Times says, "Fake news."
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.680]   Fake news.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.760]   Oh, I put this from Fortune, which I felt was sort of trustworthy.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.560]   I knew this is this is the exactly the kind of story that always turns out to be wrong.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.000]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.200]   10, I should go up.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.240]   50 50 year reserves being low.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:56.200]   Well, commodities like as a former finance reporter, that felt like legit enough.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.760]   I wasn't saying we were running out of bacon.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.560]   I was just saying.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.040]   You know what?
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:00.600]   There's no one said a low.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:10.840]   I've gone to the newspaper of record for bacon, Ohio's country journal and the Ohio
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.480]   Agnet.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.040]   And this comes straight from the Ohio Pork Council.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:25.080]   So there in the month of December, the total pork inventories,
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:31.320]   totaled 41 million pounds at the end of the month.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:39.480]   It was down to 17.8 million pounds, a decrease of 35.6 million pounds year over year
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.120]   due to a supply and demand analysts expect a continued rise in pork belly prices.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.720]   Pork belly is what gives us bacon.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.320]   So now you know when you hear about the commodities prices and all that pork bellies,
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:51.960]   that's bacon.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.160]   Right.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.360]   There's also an orange juice and like lots of other exciting commodities,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.400]   the world of commodities.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:34:59.960]   So it's fine.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   Which I've never understood.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.760]   The good news.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:06.440]   This is from a rich,
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.920]   Deaton president of the Ohio Pork Council.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:15.800]   While bacon may become more expensive for consumers, rest assured the pork industry will
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.160]   not run out of supply.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.960]   Ohio farmers will continue to work hard to ensure consumers receive
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.800]   the products they crave.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.720]   For more information, there's a website.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.000]   Baconshortage.com.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.920]   Is that that looks like fake news then?
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.960]   Baconshortage.com is blank.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.200]   It is.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.080]   It's blank.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.040]   There is no baconshortage.com.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:48.600]   That is really there's so much so many questions here.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.000]   Do you think the Ohio's country journal on ag.net would
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.080]   would pull our leg on the.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.000]   You know what?
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.840]   Let's just go look at pork belly prices.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.560]   Hello.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:35:59.960]   Hello.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.000]   Chicago Mark.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.040]   The end of December's frozen pork belly inventory marked the lowest on record since 1957.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:13.240]   Hello America.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:13.640]   Pork.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.320]   Is going away.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.640]   No more bacon for mom and dad for breakfast.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.840]   Pork bellies at their lowest since 1957.
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.680]   Where have we been doing?
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.280]   Is that all our pork to Mexico?
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.160]   Is that the problem?
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.920]   We're going to bring the pork back from Mexico.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.720]   We're going to make sure we have a wall at the border to keep the.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.760]   I don't want no more.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.360]   I don't want no Mexican pork.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.800]   Actually, you know what?
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.600]   The best pork.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:46.760]   Is Danish Korean black pork, but you don't know what you don't want to know.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760]   Why is black?
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.080]   Oh, why don't I do?
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:51.960]   Huh?
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.000]   I do.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.160]   Well, it's how they feed it.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.640]   Can I be honest?
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.920]   Now we're now we're getting now we're getting to the meat of the matter.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.040]   Here it is.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:11.720]   From this is from pork.org.uk.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.920]   Why isn't this why isn't the Chicago mercantile exchange?
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.440]   Why isn't there market online?
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.720]   Why can I not find this?
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.600]   Actually, this is the UK pig meat index.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:25.000]   There it is.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.360]   Pork.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.320]   The UK pig meat index shows a increase in pig prices.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:39.080]   Call sell prices flat, but wiener prices are going up.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:42.600]   I don't know.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.280]   I don't think that's what you think it is.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.840]   Wiener as in W-E-A-N-E-R is probably like, you know,
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.480]   "Weiners."
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.520]   I don't know what it is.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.400]   That's enough of this.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.600]   That's enough of the meat news.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.680]   This weekend meat.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.400]   Oh, Lord.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.600]   Okay.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.800]   Okay.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.560]   So what else should we talk about?
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.600]   Do you have another advertiser?
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:15.240]   There's no there's no hope from advertisers.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.600]   Show them.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.040]   Okay.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.760]   Did you read Nick Pilton's article in Vanity Fair about fake news is going to get even scarier
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.560]   than you ever dreamed?
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.120]   Can you give me the TLDR?
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.400]   TLDR, very simple.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.880]   And it's something it's everybody knows.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.360]   And Nick's writing for a more mainstream audience than he typically does.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.800]   He's saying that new technologies like Adobe has a new audio program.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.960]   There's the digital Emily project, a study in which researchers created digital actors.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.680]   It could be used in lieu of real people.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.080]   Adobe's program allows you to get voice samples and generate new voices.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.480]   This is a face-to-face real-time face capture and reenactment.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.640]   It's, remember, Clutch Cargo where they would have, you know,
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.080]   they would take a face and they'd cut out the lips and then they'd have the lips move on the face.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.480]   This is digital Clutch Cargo Watch.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.200]   This is George W. Bush.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.760]   And you see, watch his mouth and watch the mouth of the actor.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.920]   Bush's mouth is completely reflecting the mouth of the actor imperceptibly.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.480]   It doesn't look like it's cut out lips, right?
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.800]   Well, Nick, you look at it carefully.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.600]   It's after this capture.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.160]   This is built in specializes in the animation.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.600]   If it could happen, I'll be clear.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.440]   It's kind of like that.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.800]   It's not something we got to worry about.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.760]   It's a significant difference to us.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.600]   But I think there is a point to me, Mae, which is we're making really good progress
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.080]   at simulating video and audio and faking it.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:50.520]   I mean, I think if you could be easily fooled by this reenactment, watch your...
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.320]   We've had this on.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.280]   We've had?
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.800]   God bless him.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.400]   Nick declared to the end of the civilized world when Robert Skollwald came into an
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.400]   IO men's room with Google Glass.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.440]   Nick is a little bit of the, you know, technical panic.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.640]   This is the man who told us we weren't going to have pens in the future, right?
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.280]   We're not.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:14.200]   I'm still looking for pork bellies on the mark.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.800]   I like in times me cogs.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.640]   Rattle.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:27.160]   Well, and one of the things he raises is that clip that went viral from the inauguration
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:34.920]   of President Trump looking back at his wife Melania who flashes him a big smile.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.280]   And then when he turns away,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.080]   yeah, her face falls.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.480]   And he points out, you don't...
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.520]   It's not known whether that was real or not.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.960]   It would be easy enough to fake it.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.440]   I think it'd be easy enough to debunk it because obviously it must have come from
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.560]   pool.
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.680]   You know, the source video, yeah.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.880]   But he makes a good point.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.160]   And since people...
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.680]   I think the real point is this technology exists,
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.920]   it's not hard to use.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.600]   It maybe isn't perfect and then experts could certainly detect it.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.280]   But people who are willing and anxious to believe a story
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.160]   might find that sufficient to convince.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.200]   I was a...
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.920]   So back in the day when I was at the New York Daily News,
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.600]   I remember wowing the editors showing them how you could do something with this thing
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.800]   called Photoshop.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.040]   [Gasp]
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.720]   No, it would have trusted me more.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.080]   No, it's nothing to do at all.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.800]   And experts, good news, experts generally can detect Photoshop forgeries, I think.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.600]   Georgia Institute of Technology has analyzed
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.960]   66 million tweets and they now believe they can identify words and phrases that lend
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.560]   credibility to Twitter posts.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.600]   All right.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:45.560]   I'm going to growl again.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.680]   Another growly one.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.600]   Yeah, I'm going to growl about this one.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:49.560]   I know.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.920]   It's stupid.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:58.680]   So yeah, you put in the word undeniable and people can't deny it.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.840]   Or eager and terrific.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.440]   Again, highly credible.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.600]   Words indicating positive sentiment,
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.880]   but mocking the impracticality of events such as "ha",
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.760]   "grins or joking" seen as less credible.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.360]   So we're hedge words, including certain level and suspects.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.160]   You know, some people say...
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.720]   Like our approach.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.320]   Should be like way down at the bottom.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.360]   Anyway, that's, I think you're right.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.200]   I think that's another one like Nick Bilton's story.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.200]   I love Nick, but yeah, it's nothing.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.080]   Nothing we didn't know.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.160]   I think we didn't know.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   Did you read the story about all the Silicon Valley types
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.480]   who have Heidi Holes and are preparing for the end of the world?
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.080]   How could we not?
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.920]   So you want some super fun stuff?
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.800]   I did some reporting on an article about home security for the ultra rich.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.560]   And this story was reminiscent of that,
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:59.640]   except it had, I don't think I saw any mention of the big time fear
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.960]   that came up again and again with every professional high-end security
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.560]   company, which was EMPs.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.600]   Yes.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.280]   Oh, we're dead meat if you get an EMP.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:14.760]   So all of like the ultimate in home security and your bunker mentality
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.000]   is being prepared against an EMP.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.840]   And I can actually give you the names of several companies that are able to do that for you.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:26.040]   So EMP, which is electromagnetic pulse is a side effect of a nuclear explosion.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.720]   It sends a pulse of high energy that doesn't harm humans, but breaks all electronics.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.080]   And apparently you can do it without a nuclear explosion too.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.120]   So there's some EMP guns or that sort of thing.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.440]   Do it with a burst or you could do it with a certain.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.960]   It takes a lot of energy though.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.800]   That's why it's easier with a nuclear explosion.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.720]   You know, as long as you're chucking everything might as well.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:57.000]   Well, so like for instance, this survival condo project in the former Atlas missile
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.720]   silo north of Wichita, you're 15 stories of underground
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.200]   condos would be impervious to EMP.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.600]   I think I think these sufficiently deep enough not to worry about EMP.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.800]   You got other problems because if you've got food, you've got stuff,
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:20.840]   you also better have some weapons, some trained troops protecting you.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.640]   In a motorcycle, I really thought that was awesome.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.080]   And Lasik in a motorcycle.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.400]   I was like, so this is the Lasik comes from Steve and the motor.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.520]   I was coming from Steve Huffman, who was the fan, one of the founders and a great guy.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.400]   I really like Steve, one of the founders of Reddit.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.320]   This is reasonable.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.760]   Actually makes me think about doing Lasik.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.280]   He says if the world ends and not even if the world ends, but if we have trouble
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:49.400]   getting contacts or glasses is going to be a huge pain in the butt without them, I'm screwed.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.480]   I'm editing for content.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.080]   So he got Lasik.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.160]   He got surgery so he can see without his glasses.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.800]   You know, that's a compelling argument for that.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.960]   If you have diabetes, you're going to be a problem.
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.880]   If you have a heartache, you're going to have a problem.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:06.040]   If you can list lots of things.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.360]   He also says, I own a couple of motorcycles.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.520]   I have a bunch of guns and ammo, food.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.480]   I figure with that, I can hold up in my house for some amount of time.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.120]   Is it weird?
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.320]   Because I've already thought through all of these scenarios in my head.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.720]   I think about this all the time.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:20.280]   Okay, good.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.880]   Well, you're both weird.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.400]   No, I think maybe it's a function of reading too much science fiction and also
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.720]   feeling a common trope in science fiction.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:40.760]   So with global climate change and kind of the disparity between rich and poor,
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.400]   it doesn't feel like our society is on the verge of collapse exactly,
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:48.760]   but it does feel like I'm very seriously thought, you know,
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.520]   Austin, Texas is not where I should live.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.800]   You know, as the earth warms, I really should be
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.960]   living up north somewhere and probably gardening.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.480]   But I always break down when it comes to guns.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.040]   I really do.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.640]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.680]   And that's where I break down the whole thing breaks down for me,
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:14.280]   which is if you do stockpile stuff and you have prepared some sort of safe haven,
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:20.040]   you have to have some massive security because people will try to get it.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:26.520]   So if you don't have guns and barbed razor wire and dogs,
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.200]   Leo's, Leo's going over the edge.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.080]   No, well, that's why I don't.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.760]   It's like, no, I'm not going to do it.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:31.960]   I'm going down with a ship.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.120]   I'm going to be like the captain of the Titanic.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.120]   I'm waving as we go down because I don't want to do all that.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:42.920]   You have to be willing to defend it as every good science fiction author will tell you.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   You can't just stockpile.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.520]   You have to be willing to defend it.
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.400]   No, it's nutty.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.720]   Did I do this story last week?
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.480]   I apologize if I did this last week.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.320]   I did it on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.640]   So you didn't do it here.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.600]   Okay, I do it here.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.560]   I've been doing it all weeks.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.120]   I mean, the chair.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:04.040]   I've heard you talk about this all week.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:04.840]   It's the deep end.
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:05.640]   Yeah, no, I know.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.040]   Jeff is like, you guys?
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.960]   And again, no, it's disaster mentality.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:18.680]   It's typical of children of alcoholics, actually, which I'm not, but it's, but it's the, it's that.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:24.760]   And I'm sure Stacy's not either, but it's that it's that it's like you think that preparing
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.840]   in your mind, the worst is going to happen.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:33.480]   Okay, so what other positive story we can end up?
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.960]   Hey, how about the ACLU raising the origin of totalitarianism is at a stock.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.320]   Oh, you already mentioned that, Jeff.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:45.240]   Hannah Aaron's guide on how how totalitarianism happens.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.360]   The ACLU had a big weekend, million dollars from Lyft over four years.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:59.320]   ACLU got enough money to join Y Combinator as a startup,
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.440]   which is weird.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.200]   I think this is, I can't quite figure that out.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:04.760]   I can't wait to see.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.080]   They raised $24 million and they want to know how to scale the effectiveness of that
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.680]   lump of money.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.560]   So if you go to startup school, which Y Combinar is,
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.080]   you can get mentored.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.040]   And I think this is interesting, although I don't have a sense of how media savvy
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.080]   ACLU is.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.040]   I do think there's a greater role for tech in kind of the democratic process.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:34.040]   So we'll see.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.240]   And how cool would it be?
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:42.120]   Actually, the ACLU was very active on Twitter when they were fighting the executive order on
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.280]   Saturday night.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.520]   So I don't know.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.360]   No, we've interviewed Ben Wisener, who's one of the guys at the ACLU.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360]   In fact, he's going to be on this weekend lawn Friday.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.320]   He's a great guy.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.240]   Carsten's are a roommate in college.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:01.640]   And I think the ACLU is quite savvy, not media savvy in the sense that,
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:04.920]   you know, they know how to be telegenic and go on the talk shows.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:10.280]   They're savvy in the sense of they know what court cases to fight,
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.520]   and they know how to get the word out that they're fighting them,
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520]   which I think is exactly what you want.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.840]   And the ACLU doesn't always fight for, you know, on the side of the angels.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.600]   They fight on the side of the Constitution.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.560]   So.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.200]   Oh my gosh.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.640]   New ones.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.960]   We can't handle that, Leo.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:33.880]   Well, I mean, they've defended haven't they defended like Nazis and other neo-Nazis and others?
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.600]   Yeah, the ACLU doesn't decide what's right.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.120]   They decide what's legal.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.400]   They're protecting the first men.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:39.800]   They're right.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:40.840]   They're protecting the first men.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:43.320]   Well, they're doing what an AG should do, but I won't go there.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:51.560]   Hey, the six strikes copyright alert system is D-O-A.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.840]   Which we were all scared of.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.040]   It was going to ruin that at a table.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040]   It was going to ruin life and what killed it.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.720]   That's a good question.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.640]   So this, the whole idea of this was, you know, in other countries,
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.920]   there have been three strikes systems set up where if you are caught pirating content
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   or accused of pirating, not even caught,
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.880]   accused of pirating content three times, you lose all internet access forever,
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.600]   not just with your current ISP, but you're blocked forever.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.120]   We didn't want to do that in the United States.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:23.400]   So the entertainment industry made a deal with a kind of a voluntary deal with ISPs
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:32.520]   for a six strike system, which as you can see from the flow chart is fairly complicated.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.640]   And that's just one strike.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:40.920]   But the idea is increasing penalties each time you get warned, it gets worse and worse.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.120]   This is about four years old.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:47.880]   It was responsible according to Ars Technica for sending millions of notices to customers.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.800]   The problem, of course, is false positives and, you know, there's no trial.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.920]   You're just accused and guilty at the same time.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:00.440]   But really, the real problem was it didn't have any teeth.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:03.000]   It didn't curtail infringement.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.120]   And it didn't work.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.920]   Nobody was kicked off the internet.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:10.920]   The first two strikes were for educational purposes.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:17.240]   Upon a third and fourth notice, a subscriber was supposed to respond and acknowledge it.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:18.040]   I did wrong.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.360]   On the fifth and sixth notice is you might have your speeds throttled.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:26.120]   And then the plan leaves it up to rights holders if they want to sue,
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:31.400]   but nobody in the content is going to sue anymore because that didn't work so well for the music industry.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:41.480]   So it just, you know, the statement, after four years of extensive consumer education and
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.960]   engagement, the copyright alert system will conclude its work.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.320]   The program demonstrated that real progress is possible.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.640]   Not that it failed.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.320]   It did exactly what it was supposed to do.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:59.320]   It educated people who were infringing.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.320]   The MPAA said they were a little more forthright.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.880]   It didn't curtail infringement.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.120]   And it was a pain in the ass.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.480]   I'm probably expensive to figure out.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:15.320]   This is Stephen for Britzio, executive vice president and general counsel at the MPAA.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.040]   These repeat infringers are the ones who drive ongoing and problematic peer-to-peer piracy.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:25.320]   In fact, an estimated 981 movies and TV shows were downloaded in the US last year using peer-to-peer.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.840]   And the program was not simply not set up to deal with a hardcore repeat and fringe
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:34.120]   your problem. In other words, they just figured out ways around it.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.360]   Like using your Wi-Fi.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:39.800]   Oh, like my Wi-Fi.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.560]   Yeah. Like coming over to Stacys.
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.040]   My wondering.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:50.120]   Because I've gotten now from Comcast to notices about using more than a terabyte.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.320]   But that's too noticed it's stretched out over five months.
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:53:00.680]   So 500 gigabytes, then 1,400 gigabytes, then 500 gigabytes, then 1,200 gigabytes.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:04.920]   Then 500. So I don't understand why it's going up and down like that.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.800]   Do you have a backup?
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.400]   Automated backup that runs every 45 days.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.920]   No.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.480]   Everything I have is continuous.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:21.640]   There's nothing that happens every month or one, you know, every other month or anything like that.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.160]   It's all continuous. And we haven't changed our viewing habits. I don't use BitTorrent.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.160]   I can't figure it out.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:33.080]   So this is actually where the Eros fall down, which I think Eros is a sponsor of the show.
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:37.240]   So I agree with you. I want to know what's using what?
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:40.840]   What's using what? I used to have a router that would show me that.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:44.600]   Okay.
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.800]   I did too. My AC3200 would do that.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.120]   But I retired it for a mesh.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:57.960]   Well, we should call a good old Nick and be like Nick, get on it.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.520]   Nick, Bill? Scare everybody.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.640]   Nick, Nick Weaver.
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:02.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.200]   The CEO of
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.040]   Eero.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:06.200]   Eero.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.520]   I bet you, actually I bet you they are.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.240]   I wouldn't be surprised because, but that's a more complicated thing to do.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.000]   But they do at least know each device, right?
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.960]   So they could theoretically monitor the bandwidth of each device.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.400]   I just don't know if they want to spend that horsepower to do that.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.920]   Yeah. Software development.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.880]   All right.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.720]   All right. I think we should stop talking.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:31.400]   Because good. Because I have to go to the bathroom and be, I have to start it.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.080]   Oh, is it TMI, Jeff?
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.920]   Have you made anything in your, um, what?
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.800]   Oh, what kind?
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.840]   Have you made anything?
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.080]   That's usually where the crude one stays.
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:43.560]   He got you.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.480]   Have you made anything in your new oven?
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.800]   I had beef tenderloin the other night.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:50.840]   And it was so good.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:54.280]   So you're, you think it's really worth the 1500 bucks that you spent on that?
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.280]   Okay. I am so sold on this.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:56.920]   And you know what?
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:00.680]   It's not me that thinks it's worthwhile necessarily.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.960]   It's the fact that my husband, who is a total normal person,
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:06.520]   thinks this is worthwhile because he basically,
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.880]   my husband, I love him,
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.880]   but the man loves his food cooked beyond all recognition.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.520]   Oh, he must be a native.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.320]   He's, he's special.
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:22.040]   So when he's making anything,
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:25.080]   I'm just like, like, take it out now.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:25.880]   Take it out now.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.120]   And he's like, no, no, you'll get sick.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:28.680]   You'll die.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.920]   Oh, he's afraid of, uh, Trigonosis.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920]   He's afraid of everything.
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.280]   So do you like it rare?
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.480]   If it's like a piece of good meat,
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.760]   yes, it should be rare.
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.040]   We should run off together, Stacy,
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.160]   because I'm the same way.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:45.880]   And I'm surrounded by people who want it well done.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.480]   Well, so this is awesome.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.000]   So you're just like, boom, I want it rare.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.360]   You stick the temperature probe in.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.960]   Oh, then you can take your half out.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.720]   I take mine out and then his.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:56.680]   Oh, maybe I'll get this.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.200]   I do that on the grill.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.360]   You start eating or do yours get cold?
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.520]   I put a little piece of foil.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:04.520]   I tent the foil over it so it stays warm.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.160]   It doesn't take long.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.360]   All right, I'm just concerned about it.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.400]   And you actually want steak or whatever you're cooking to sit for a little bit
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.440]   after you take it out anyway.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:10.600]   Yes.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:13.000]   So what are you dying to make in it?
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.440]   I think it recognizes and has
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:21.640]   recipes already for like 25, I think, pre-cooked foods.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.080]   And I've made most of them.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:23.400]   Wow.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.200]   We should disclaimer, they are an advertiser on your other podcast.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.160]   Sorry, yes.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.920]   I they are an advertiser on my podcast, but I did buy the oven.
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:35.880]   Yeah, she took the money they paid her for advertising
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.720]   and bought at June oven, which is kind of a net net zero.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.000]   Kind of.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:41.640]   It's not.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.600]   They given that.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.640]   I gave them the fish and ovens directly.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.440]   I get yeah, right.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.840]   Just save the middleman and just say, pay me an ovens.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.680]   I paid $50 for a deposit, but I can't bring myself to pay $1,500 for a toaster oven.
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:59.720]   You know, if it's not a toaster oven, it's a full scale oven.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.000]   I've made chickens in that.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.520]   I've made salmon.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.760]   I make roast vegetables.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:08.280]   You know what?
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.080]   I'm going to make a souffle because those are freaking complicated.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:12.920]   You can't make a souffle in there.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.200]   You know what this reminds me of?
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:15.000]   I'm old enough.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]   Leo and I are old enough to remember.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.360]   Sorry.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:21.640]   Leo and I are old enough to remember the introduction of the microwave oven.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.880]   Right, Leo?
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.280]   Yeah, they call it a radar range.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:27.480]   Right.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.560]   Because it's radar to cook your food.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:30.200]   They are.
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.880]   And there was the same exact discussion.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:34.200]   Oh, nobody's going to use that one ridiculous thing.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.520]   Who needs a baked potato in four minutes?
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:37.240]   Oh my God.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:37.880]   What's it going to do?
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:38.840]   This is really stupid.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:41.240]   She stays. He's ahead of us.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.840]   But no, this is an oven.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:44.280]   This is a regular oven.
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.480]   The difference is.
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.240]   So it's not so it's okay.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.360]   It is a convection oven.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.080]   It's a convection oven.
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:49.480]   It has.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.640]   So we have heating elements,
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.560]   which means it preheats.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:58.200]   It comes to like from zero to 400 in just like three minutes.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:58.920]   Okay.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.360]   So that's going to cut a minute off.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.040]   That's handy right there.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:02.600]   Okay.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:05.320]   No, my oven my big ovens take like.
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.920]   Oh yeah, but I have a Breville convection toaster oven.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.040]   Oh, this is your Breville.
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:13.240]   So the presets are awesome.
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:15.320]   They're going to only get better.
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:17.160]   So like if something doesn't work,
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.840]   you're like, oh, this didn't work for me.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.480]   And you tell it.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.480]   And it's like, okay, well,
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:24.360]   so they've already done something with like the cookies.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:29.000]   They realized that they had tuned their oven for slice and bake cookies.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.880]   But people were putting homemade cookies in there.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.880]   And they were like, yeah, they come out bird.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:34.920]   And so they fixed it.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:37.160]   You can make it.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:39.720]   The intelligence, the intelligence.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.840]   That's what's interesting about it.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:47.080]   It's so, I mean, again, I can't return it for after up for 100 days.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:48.200]   So maybe I will do it.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.440]   So you've got till March,
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.680]   if you order it before like March 31st,
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.520]   you can you can return it after before 100 days are up.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.680]   And cooks more in your house.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.280]   I'm the cook.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.000]   And Stacy, yours.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.600]   So that's it's both.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.560]   It's I'm the fan.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:10.440]   So you could actually make something and leave it in the fridge.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.920]   And then just be like, yo, Lisa,
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.680]   pop this in the oven at this time.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.360]   And then you could have like dinner waiting when you get home.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:21.320]   Oh, it's early for you though.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:21.800]   Never mind.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.840]   Yeah, that doesn't.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:23.720]   That doesn't sell me.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:31.640]   I, you know, the other problem is I have a lot of I in the in my past have spent a lot of money
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.160]   on stupid kitchen gadgets.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.760]   And we're running out of counter space.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:38.280]   Well, you just got to get rid of the sell the ones you don't like.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:42.360]   So what's Stacy?
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.800]   What's the what's the kitchen gadget that you most regretted buying in life?
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.200]   And Leo.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:49.560]   Oh, I thought you were going to ask me like the one I like,
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.120]   which is my Vitamix, but I have a Vitamix to it.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.400]   I'll stand by on that one.
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:54.280]   That's an awesome thing.
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:57.720]   That's just a big ass blender, powerful blender.
[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.920]   Oh, it's the best blender.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:03.960]   There was an article in New York Times about these new fast cookers.
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.000]   And it's like the same thing.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.080]   People like crazy about their fast cookers.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.120]   Oh, thanks to pot.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.080]   I have an instant pot.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.400]   Sorry, I get very excited.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.480]   I will not buy an instant pot.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:16.520]   Oh, why not Leo?
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:19.560]   I have, I have a pressure cooker.
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.920]   I don't need another pressure cooker.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.280]   Oh, okay.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:22.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.200]   It's a pressure cooker that makes yogurt.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:24.600]   So fast.
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:25.240]   Okay.
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.840]   Food processor actually is probably my least exciting thing.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.600]   And I don't own a kitchen made mixer.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.720]   Those fancy kitchen made.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.640]   I have a kitchen aid mixer and I used it.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.640]   Yesterday to make macaroons.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.400]   I used that.
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.920]   That's what I use more than anything.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.040]   I can make pasta with it.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:41.560]   I hate baking.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.360]   I'm not a baker.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:42.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.560]   I'll tell you the gadget I wish I hadn't bought.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.600]   I'm trying to get rid of.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.960]   And I was, we interviewed Jenny Giardin.
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:52.680]   And I'm a sucker.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:53.720]   See, people tell me about this stuff.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:54.760]   I go, oh, I got to get it.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:56.840]   And she's talking about homemade tortillas.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.600]   So I went on Amazon and I bought a tortilla press.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:00.920]   No.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.920]   Not an automatic manual tortilla press.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:09.160]   And I have in my pantry a 50 pound bag of corn
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.960]   that's been sitting there.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.560]   How long ago was that interview?
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:14.760]   A year ago.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.200]   And another bag of lime,
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.280]   because this doesn't seem like a good idea,
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.480]   but you use lime.
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:23.640]   You slake the corn somehow.
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:27.320]   And then the press and I have never made tortillas.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.520]   So if anybody wants,
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:30.200]   I tried to palm it off the other day
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.760]   at one of our employees, she wouldn't have any of it.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.520]   She said, yeah, I don't have much room in the kitchen.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:35.080]   Thanks anyway.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:35.400]   Bye.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:36.760]   So.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:39.800]   Yeah, tortilla press,
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:41.640]   George Foreman, girls, Penini.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.760]   I have a Penini grill.
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:44.280]   I do have a Penini grill.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.560]   Bought that, put that in the back.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.760]   That's way in the back of the cupboard,
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.880]   now gathering dust.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:48.760]   I got that for my son.
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:49.160]   I have a bread maker.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:50.840]   No, I won't do that.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:51.560]   It looks like R2D2.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.000]   And actually, I like it.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.360]   I'm afraid of bread makers,
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:55.320]   because I would make bread.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.240]   And eat it.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.200]   That's delicious.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.240]   Slather it with butter.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:01.800]   And eat the whole damn loaf before anybody got home.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.800]   Well, yeah.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:05.640]   But then you can make another one so easily.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.960]   That wasn't exactly what I was concerned about.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.600]   Now I'm trying to find my June email.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:13.720]   They sent me an email.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:14.840]   Is it June.com?
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:17.160]   I think it's June.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.600]   Oh, June Oven, maybe?
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:19.560]   June Oven.com.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:19.880]   All right.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.160]   I'm going to just try to find that email,
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:21.960]   because they said,
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:24.440]   hey, you never sent us the rest of the money.
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:24.680]   Hey.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:26.360]   You want that oven?
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:26.840]   You want that?
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.160]   Come on.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.920]   You must want that oven, don't you?
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.120]   It's your turn.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:31.080]   You can have it now.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.960]   I really like this.
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.640]   Even when it's not the presets,
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:38.680]   it's, but again, you know,
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.280]   I, it fits with our life.
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:43.560]   I'll leave it at that.
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:44.520]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.440]   Here it is from Matt Van Horn.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.760]   Exciting times, Matt writes June Ovens are now.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:50.120]   Don't show that.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.480]   That's got my token in it.
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.120]   Oh, you know, what if you want to see it in action?
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:00.920]   There's a court, the village at Corte Madeira.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:01.240]   Yes.
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.520]   It's just down the road to peace.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:03.080]   Yes.
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:04.760]   So you can actually go see it there.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.960]   They've got a pop-up showroom.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.120]   And you can probably,
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.000]   I bet they do demonstrate.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.760]   You are June Oven pusher?
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:11.880]   No, I'm just looking at it.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.240]   You asked to be about it.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:14.200]   I didn't even bring it up.
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.160]   June Oven pusher.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:19.640]   I see.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.160]   She's a June Ovenist.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:23.640]   I am a convert.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.080]   I will be honest, but I am.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.000]   Interesting how people get really,
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.920]   they proselytize for their new thing, right?
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:34.680]   I proselyt anything that makes my life easier.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.240]   I will proselytize about.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.120]   I mean, that, yeah.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.120]   I have the most.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.400]   I do have to buy it because apparently I put $100 down on it.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.480]   I can't very well just leave that on the table.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.320]   All right.
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.000]   I just bought the June Oven.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:56.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:01.080]   I think you don't like it.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:01.880]   You can send it back.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:03.000]   I have 100 days to send it back.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.760]   Well, I had to buy it because he showed my offer code on the screen.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.680]   And I had to buy it before somebody else got to it.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:12.920]   Took my $100.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.520]   All right.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.240]   Oh, man.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.080]   Does it work with an average?
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.080]   I just bought something exciting.
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:21.560]   What'd you get?
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.400]   But it was only $100.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.760]   I bought a PINE64.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.280]   What's that?
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:28.680]   Board.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:31.080]   It's a computer board.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.960]   And I bought a Z-Wave module and a Wi-Fi module.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.800]   And I'm going to download OpenHAB.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:38.120]   You are such a cool person.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:39.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   I can't believe how cool you--
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   Can't find the answer to the question I heard.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:43.880]   Shut up.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:50.280]   Apparently, Alexa thought I was talking to her when I said you're such a cool person.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:57.240]   So you're going to make your own app, OpenHAB device.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.120]   I'm going to make my own OpenHAB smart home hub.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.880]   So OpenHAB is the same.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.520]   What level is OpenHAB at?
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.560]   It's an open source.
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.240]   It's not it's not at the Z-Wave level.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.280]   It's a lower level than that.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:11.400]   No, I know.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.520]   It's higher than that.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:12.920]   Higher than that.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:16.680]   So OpenHAB is a application layer.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.440]   So you can use it to program your devices.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:24.280]   Now, so I pledged on my podcast to try this out finally,
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.200]   because so many people were like, "Stacy, you've got to see.
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:29.880]   You've got to try this, so I'm going to do it."
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:34.600]   It's vendor neutral, but it does ride on Z-Wave, you said, right?
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:35.240]   You have to--
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:41.240]   So yes, I had to buy a Z-Wave module to talk to any of my Z-Wave devices,
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.720]   if that makes sense, right?
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:45.160]   So that's--
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:48.760]   So you could use Zigbee if you had Zigbee devices.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.280]   If I had a Zigbee module.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:50.600]   Yes.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:54.360]   So that's the physical, the literal computer.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.960]   This is up at the application layer, not at the network layer.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.280]   Yeah, and OpenHAB is on top of it.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:00.520]   Nice.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.120]   I can't wait to hear about it.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:03.960]   Going to be fun.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:05.080]   Why did you choose that chip?
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.360]   But the Pine64?
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:08.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.200]   Because they have a friendly Z-Wave module,
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:18.280]   and my friend Kai Krewzner, who is the guy who does most of the OpenHAB stuff,
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:23.640]   promised that he had an SD card with all the OpenHAB to flash onto it.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.120]   Ah.
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:24.520]   The Pine64.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:25.800]   Ready to run.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.200]   OK.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:28.040]   So I'm like, boom, I want that.
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:30.760]   Because you could use a Raspberry Pi, there are other devices you could use.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:31.400]   Yes.
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:36.520]   You could use a Pi, and this was like a way to make it slightly easier for someone like me.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.760]   Did you get your order in before Chinese New Year?
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.920]   Um, no.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:42.760]   You're not going to see it for a long time.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:44.440]   Not forever.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.400]   No, just a month.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.840]   Cool.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:47.880]   I want to hear all about it.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:52.360]   So yeah, when the time comes, you guys, I will show you my smart home.
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.200]   We've given you a lot of pics.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.240]   We probably shouldn't even bother doing pics of the week, but why not?
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:01.240]   Jeff, you've got a number, and then I'll let Stacy do her.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:03.080]   Oh, let's see what I should do.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:03.480]   All right.
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.560]   Relevant to the earlier discussion.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:09.080]   97% of voice apps are used for one week only.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.840]   [laughter]
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:13.080]   That's what I did of right there.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:13.480]   Diddy.
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:14.680]   One week.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:15.080]   Yep.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:15.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.040]   One week.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.960]   Uh, is that voice apps like?
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:18.440]   It was fun.
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:18.520]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:20.920]   It's like talking to people or skills.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:23.080]   It's echo and uh, and people also.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:23.080]   Okay.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:24.360]   And, and all skills, yeah.
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:27.880]   Uh, and with some, you know, that makes sense, though.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.560]   There are a few that I keep using.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.440]   Actually, mostly I just use the built-in stuff, come to think of it.
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.480]   We also have to remember it's hard enough when you have your phone,
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:39.080]   you have a little reminder that does that.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:40.280]   Oh, I can use that.
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:42.040]   But, but to remember that, oh, yeah.
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:42.840]   Well, what did I do?
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.360]   Use home for last week.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.920]   You know what I do do as last week, Matthew Ingram mentioned 60 dB,
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:52.680]   um, which is kind of a, um, radius.
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:53.640]   Oh, I was on that.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:54.360]   Yeah.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:54.920]   It's cool.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.000]   Stacy and IOT was on it.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.360]   No, um, I, I was talking about a cheap pie when he,
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:03.400]   my friend, a friend of mine that I used to work with at Gigo-Ome,
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:05.720]   Liz Gaines is a reporter for 60.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.280]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:06.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.760]   Did she, I was wondering if she moved over.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:09.960]   I hear her voice all the time.
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.240]   Yes.
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:12.200]   So that's her new job.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.800]   She's not a recode anymore.
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:14.680]   That is her new job.
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:15.160]   She, um,
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:15.800]   Congratulations.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:18.840]   She had a baby, did a fellowship, and then did this.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:19.960]   I love Liz.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.080]   Uh, she's been on her fellowship.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:21.560]   Which fellowship did she do?
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.920]   That is a really hard question and I can't answer it.
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:27.880]   So this is an excellent, uh, echo skill then.
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:33.480]   You, you have to open that skill and then you can say, um, computer.
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:35.400]   Actually, I turned her on.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:35.960]   Computer.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.360]   I listened to 60 dB.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.000]   Hmm.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.120]   I can't find the answer.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.800]   And she'll have no idea what you're saying.
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:46.600]   They have, we're on it.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:47.800]   Some twit bits are on it.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:50.120]   It's, they have short ones that, you know, five, 10 minutes
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.560]   and then they have longer shows and you pick the categories,
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.520]   but then it picks just kind of an endless feed.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.680]   And this was Matthew Ingram's pick last week and I love it.
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:00.040]   And so I'm still using that skill.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:00.600]   I like it.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.120]   And it's kind of like it's just a mishmosh of news and,
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.920]   and interesting stuff and short audio recordings is what she told me.
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.960]   It was supposed to be almost all podcast from podcasts,
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.200]   but she occasionally will come on and do a story.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.280]   Um, she and I did one.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:16.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.160]   And you did one.
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:17.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.840]   So they're already now content.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.040]   She interviewed me.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.000]   So it was exciting.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:21.160]   Right.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.120]   She'll do her own content.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.400]   So they have, uh, get to know Neil Gorsuch.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.040]   Um, the Gorsuch announcement is seen from reality TV producers.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.760]   So I guess she's doing interviews for them, which is great.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:33.880]   But then they have CBS news.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:35.000]   Here's like a twit bits.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.920]   Um, so I think this is great.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:41.080]   I like this wake up and smell the coffee robot.
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.560]   Beyonce pregnant with twins.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.240]   See if I've been listening, I would have known.
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:47.880]   That's what I'm here for.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.160]   You're awesome.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:51.560]   You're big pop culture news.
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.640]   What's your pick of the week, Stacy?
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.920]   Um, this is actually a podcast and I feel like I've never talked about it,
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:02.280]   but I love it and your audience is probably going to appreciate it.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.760]   If they don't already know about it, which I bet you guys do.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:07.960]   Um, this is, I always script the name of it though.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.080]   So, uh, it's the flash forward podcast.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:15.400]   And this is, it comes out, it used to come out twice a month.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:16.600]   Now I think it's once a month.
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.640]   Um, it's well produced.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.640]   They basically take a scenario from the near future and run with it.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.760]   So it can be something like robotic farming and they start every show with like,
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:31.480]   they immerse you in the future world, right?
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:38.440]   So you get this like, uh, it's just like a NPR podcast, except it's not real.
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.400]   Um, and so is it like black mirror?
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.360]   Kind of, but not always as grim.
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.320]   Um, Jeff, you would like the future of news.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.720]   They in December, they did one in the future news and it started out with like,
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.200]   President Jim Bannon was eating Thanksgiving dinner with his family in Marina Del Rey, California.
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:57.800]   And then the next was a different story.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.240]   It was like President Jim Bannon was in spent Thanksgiving in Iraq and people were really upset.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:07.000]   And they went through several of those and you're like, oh my God, what's happening?
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.880]   And then she breaks in with the future of news, you know, is fake.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.960]   And we won't know how to tell the difference.
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.120]   And then she brings in experts to talk about what this means.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:19.960]   So it's really engaging show.
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:20.200]   Right.
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.880]   It's awesome.
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.440]   I love it.
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:24.280]   Rose Everleff.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.280]   And she is just amazing.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:30.600]   And no wonder it takes a month to do because that's a lot of work.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:31.560]   It is.
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:31.880]   It is.
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:35.880]   It is a very well, it's not like it's not like the podcast we slept together, Leo.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:37.880]   It's it's not like a trash.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:38.520]   We cranked.
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.520]   This is actually produced.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:41.560]   This is.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:41.880]   Yeah.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:43.320]   So it's it's really good.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:44.280]   I like it a lot.
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:44.600]   Nice.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:51.640]   It's a you can find it at flash forward podcast screen.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.280]   Dot com.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.480]   Flash forward podcast.
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:56.840]   Dot com.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:00.040]   Oh, someone asked if you allow promos for other podcasts.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:01.560]   It never even occurred to me.
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:02.040]   No, we don't.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:04.040]   So I'm just going to edit this out and you'll never hear it.
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.640]   Of course we do.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:08.200]   I was like, it's just good content.
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:09.080]   Yeah, I don't care.
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:10.840]   Yeah, I'm not competitive.
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:12.440]   Well, I am competitive, but I'll.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.440]   So can I also I'm going to plug I'm going to plug.
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.080]   So hold this against you for years, Jeff.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.440]   Go ahead.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.040]   So dot NYC we did shows today.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:22.600]   Yeah, what happened?
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.080]   Wednesday.
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.400]   We just I will so so dot.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:28.200]   I think we finally got the some of us and you and Lisa.
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:28.600]   I know about this.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.720]   I think we finally figured out the structure of it.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:34.840]   I do an interview show and I do we do kind of a shark tanky show,
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.120]   but nice because we have no money.
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.360]   And so today as I said earlier, I interviewed.
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:43.320]   The was it yesterday.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:46.120]   If you go to if you go to Facebook and look up dot NYC show,
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.320]   you'll find it there.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:49.000]   And so I interviewed there.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:49.480]   She is.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.520]   Michael Rosen, who is the chief legal officer of Kickstarter.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:57.960]   And then we have three Kickstarter products on one is
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:01.960]   Dame products, which makes vibrators.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:07.720]   They were the first sex toy on Kickstarter and really kind of interesting how it was done.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.520]   And then there's a bicycle that puts all the gears in some place.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.280]   So it doesn't ever break and it's neat.
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.320]   And then we had a guy who made a clock that only goes for one year.
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.760]   And there are products that were successful.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:21.000]   That's a good modernization strategy.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.400]   We admit it.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.000]   It's only for a year.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.440]   I don't mean it only works for you.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:27.800]   It takes a year to go around.
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:29.400]   Oh, sorry.
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.800]   Hey, that's great.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:34.120]   Hey, you're a major new tune oven.
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:34.600]   Good news.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.880]   That's a good idea.
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:40.120]   You have only so many kelvins in your oven and then it goes away.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:40.600]   It's over.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.000]   Yeah.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:41.480]   Yeah.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.960]   Don't worry about a letter you won't have in the year.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:49.160]   So anyway, our city grant has run out.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:52.200]   And I think we finally,
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.640]   for many, many false tries.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.560]   And boy, I learned Leo and Lisa how hard it is to do podcasts and figure out what it is.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.480]   But I think we finally got there.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:00.840]   So now we don't do money.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:03.080]   So the question to the world is,
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:06.360]   I'm going to go and write some letters to some rich people in New York who are in technology.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.440]   Who ought to support this because it supports New York technology.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:09.480]   It's a great idea.
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:09.800]   I like it.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:13.480]   Should we do a Kickstarter campaign for the podcast?
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:14.760]   Patreon.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:15.720]   Patreon, I agree.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.440]   Do you use Patreon?
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:19.320]   Stacey?
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:19.640]   I don't.
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:21.880]   You just do ads.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:22.360]   I can't.
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:23.400]   You have to choose.
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.720]   If you're going to do ads, you really shouldn't do Patreon.
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.440]   Right.
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:30.360]   And I find, I don't want to ask my audience for money.
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:32.360]   I'm really bad at asking even advertisers.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.080]   Exactly.
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:33.560]   Exactly.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:34.520]   Exactly.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:40.040]   Don't, I don't like, I don't want to become like, you know, public radio where every 15
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.400]   minutes you're doing pledge drives and.
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.840]   Although I have a backlog of South by Southwest tote bags from years of going.
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:47.640]   So I could.
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.400]   You bring gifts of tote bag for every donation.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:51.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.600]   Tote bag.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:53.320]   Tote bag.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:54.040]   Get your tote bag.
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:57.160]   You could also give away fizzes, but you have a few of those.
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:57.720]   Yeah.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:59.000]   No, we give them to our hosts.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.360]   I know.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.280]   I'm not taking fizzes from other body.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:02.280]   Everybody.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:02.840]   Sorry.
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:04.200]   I'm not giving it away to anybody.
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:04.440]   Okay.
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:04.760]   Good.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:05.640]   I don't have a fence.
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:09.160]   Stacey, you deserve a fizz.
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:12.120]   And I don't know how we escaped fizzing you.
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:13.880]   Well, because you weren't with us yet.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:15.960]   I think I was probably old.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.600]   This came out like it was like Christmas, wasn't it?
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.560]   Uh, yeah, it was.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:20.680]   Yeah, but we'll get you.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:21.240]   We'll get you.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.160]   I think we might get fine of fizz for you.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:23.880]   I'm okay with that.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:24.120]   Yeah.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:24.840]   That's what I thought.
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.680]   The truth comes out.
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:30.840]   I didn't get a fizz, but I don't want a fizz.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.080]   So.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.160]   Thanks anyway.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.040]   I'm a don't know.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:35.000]   You don't want Stacey needs.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.440]   I'm a lord.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.480]   Stacey needs some like,
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:39.640]   twit artwork for those walls.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:42.520]   You don't like it when a sentence begins with that, do you?
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.680]   You know what Stacey needs?
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.040]   I have art, Jeff.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:47.560]   You just don't see it.
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:50.360]   It's it's it's invisible art.
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.280]   It's in front of me where I face.
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:55.640]   Here, you want to see you want to see my favorite picture?
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:56.280]   You will like it.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:56.920]   Yeah, sure.
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.240]   Sure.
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:15:58.280]   Wow.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.160]   This is exciting.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.360]   It is.
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:00.680]   Yeah.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:02.760]   A little window into Stacey's life.
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:04.280]   It is kind of barren from the view.
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:08.680]   Mm.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:10.280]   Keep mum.
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:11.480]   She's not so dumb.
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:16.200]   Is that a that's like a World War two propaganda poster?
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:16.600]   I know.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:17.240]   Isn't it awesome?
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:18.440]   World War one, maybe.
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:21.320]   And it's the idea is loose lip sync ships.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.240]   Don't talk in front of the ladies.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:24.760]   She's not as dumb as she looks.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.280]   I thought it was.
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:27.240]   I love it.
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:28.200]   It's perfect.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:32.360]   I've got my princess Leia resist art that's coming or that I'm.
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:34.920]   So you're a little feminist woman that room.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:37.240]   Did you.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:41.840]   a
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:46.940]   a the of of
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:52.060]   that that should be podcast or keep mum. She's not so dumb. That would be a great podcast album,
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:57.500]   Mark. Um, I'll work on that. It's so related to the internet of things.
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:01.100]   Well, we got to do a new podcast. Oh, okay. Stacy is no. Stacey Noes thing Stacy.
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:07.820]   Stacy no things Stacy. Okay. Stacy ruins everything they see those best. All right,
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:11.500]   it's time to say goodbye everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, and we are working by the way,
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:16.540]   you'll be relieved to know we are working on the punch Leo button. I've Oh, excellent. I've tasked
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:20.540]   our, I've tasked our crack engineering staff with figuring out how to do it.
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:26.220]   Well, if they want, they should email me and I'm happy to work with them because I do want that
[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:30.780]   button. That's an ultimate internet of things device. Why get one for Kevin,
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:35.340]   Tosey could hit us both. Yeah. No, we get one for me and Kevin. I think Kevin Tofel probably needs
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:43.660]   one too. Kevin, Kevin doesn't need a Kevin is perfect. He's he's just like, oh my, oh my,
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:55.180]   you're not her favorite coast. Leo, I'm sorry. I know it hurts. Kevin's been with me for years.
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:18:01.020]   Like, like almost a decade. Holy moly. I have to send him more bourbon. All right.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:08.380]   You sent him bourbon too. Well, he's, he's my cohost, man. He's okay. Leo's like,
