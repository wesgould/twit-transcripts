[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.920]   And today we're very cloudy.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.360]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.880]   We're looking in skyward.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.080]   But before we do that, let's say hello to our panel today,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.720]   a great panel joining us from all over the world.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.960]   Well, not really.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.760]   Starting with Sheena Dravani, who
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.000]   is calling from San Diego.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.120]   How are you?
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.920]   I am great.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.360]   Thank you for being on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.720]   It was really fun having you.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.600]   It was so fun.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.760]   It was so great to finally see the cottage on back
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.080]   my office in San Diego, a little sadder to be here instead
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.600]   of there.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.280]   But love doing Twig.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   It was fun.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.680]   And Gina and I had some special time together, which was great.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.880]   We got to talk and stuff.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.360]   And it was really nice.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   Also welcoming another fellow who was also on Twit this week,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   which is Kevin Marks from Salesforce.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   I don't know.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.600]   Again, and chatter.com.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   Great to see you this time in his garden in a beautiful setting.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240]   Is there any birds you hear at my fault?
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640]   And I'm just hoping you won't hear poodles and more most.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   Or children.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.800]   Also joining us in very apt today,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Danny Sullivan from SearchEngineland.com,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.320]   because Google had a big search announcement yesterday.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   And we'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.520]   Thank you, Danny, for joining us.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.240]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   Good to have you.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.920]   And a quick look at the moon, just to see, yes,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160]   it's fully occluded now.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.760]   Google's actually streaming this video on YouTube Live,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   youtube.com/google.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.800]   So you can watch-- I guess where is it?
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.200]   South America, right?
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   So we're not in the Northern Hemisphere able to see this.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240]   But what's even more fun is Google--
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.640]   the Google Doodle today, if you go to google.com,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.600]   it's too late if you're listening after the fact.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.520]   But if you go to google.com, they've got a little slider.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.720]   And they show you exactly-- in real time,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.400]   the state of the moon, which is fully occluded as we speak.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.120]   And you can go back and forth.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   I don't know why they put a slider in there.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.360]   But you go back and--
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   I'm sure it's HTML5.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.120]   Of course it is.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.680]   They're demonstrating another HTML5 control, right?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   You think that that's a widget that's built in?
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   Or you have to actually--
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.760]   you must have to do it, though.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   There was a built-in slider in HTML5.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   Is there?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.720]   Is that really cool?
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.200]   And look, the hand changes.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.440]   Pretty sure.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.040]   From its arrow, pointing Mickey Mouse glove, hand.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   And we can drag it around.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.080]   Yeah, of course, every Google Doodle now
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   is really going to be an HTML5 demo from now on, right?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.680]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.320]   That's just a given.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.840]   So I thought--
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.600]   They've been doing a good job with them, though.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.720]   Oh, they're fun.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.920]   The last Paul Doodle was really awesome.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   The guitar that you could actually play and record your music.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.320]   Are there any-- is there anybody who's uploaded to those anywhere?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.040]   What people have done?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.320]   I wonder.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   Let me see.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.400]   They didn't-- I was disappointed that Google didn't actually
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.640]   make it easy for people to upload them in exactly that way.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.880]   There were a couple papers that did some roundups.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.400]   And you can do its search for best Google guitar songs.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.480]   And you'll hear people who were playing "Stairway to Heaven"
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.520]   or other stuff like that.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.080]   But it was like, come on, carry on with it.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.520]   Make it easy for people to submit.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.720]   They got the cool Doodle, and they didn't have the ball
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.360]   after that.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   I think you'd have to have a camera and record it.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.360]   Here's somebody who did the--
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.400]   Climate.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200]   --as the same spin.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.080]   Who's talking?
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.720]   Oh, this is the--
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.440]   It's YouTube.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.200]   I see YouTube.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.520]   So there's narration.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.680]   Wow, there's nothing really quite as dynamic as a lunar eclipse.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   Inside.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   I think it's a camera.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040]   So the moon is not the odd game.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.320]   It's not enough.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.040]   Title forces have done this too.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.520]   Absolutely.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   You know what would be cool is if I played the music
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.320]   from the Google Doodle.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.160]   So there it is.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.640]   There's the same features that we always see behind it.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.280]   Inside that always faces us.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.240]   I think that's a really interesting point you raised there, Bob,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.760]   because--
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.520]   I thought our shows were boring.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   As we learn more about the universe around us, what we want.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   [DING]
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.840]   Whoa, whoa, and so--
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.000]   It's got a little over on.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.520]   Isn't this unique expression?
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.280]   We thought it was a wanted it to be.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   And of course it is.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.240]   I'll turn off the eclipse.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.640]   It's exoplanets around other stars.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   That's really cool.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.720]   [DING]
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.880]   This is from geek.com.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.960]   PC Magazine Creative Director, Chris Phillips.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.320]   [DING]
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.080]   Oh no, this is not--
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.960]   It's not both Canon.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   [DING]
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Wow.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   [DING]
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   [DING]
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.800]   That's pretty cool.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.880]   I didn't know you could use a keyboard, actually.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.360]   OK.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.120]   Yeah, you had the Turnoff Google Instant to make it work.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.680]   Oh, that's what it was.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.640]   Yeah, you know, it's just another thing.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.200]   They don't explain this.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   It's like, could it be that hard for you to maybe--
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.480]   when you-- they're doing more of these interactive things.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.360]   It's discovery.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   And it's fun if you write about them,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.480]   because then you can discover this stuff
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.560]   and explain to people that, oh, the test tubes.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.120]   And when they did the test tube thing,
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.360]   and if you moved it really fast, it was going to go boiling.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.040]   There are all sorts of different things going on.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.240]   But it's nice that there were some instructions.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   Well, I'll think of it as like Easter eggs, right?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.200]   I'm sure they treated it.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   Well, I mean, yeah, there's that too.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.640]   You kind of want to take away-- oh, you got to discover it.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.080]   But then--
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.720]   [DING]
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.160]   This is-- lady Gaga's paparazzi.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.320]   OK, that is awesome.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520]   I don't know if that--
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.840]   I thought that sounds so good.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.080]   You know, I was so frustrated.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   I kept trying to use the keyboard,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.880]   but it kept executing a search.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   And I couldn't figure out why, because I read instructions
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.440]   somewhere.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.680]   And so now I know I had to turn instant off.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.200]   Ah.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   Should have gone to search engine land.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.840]   He would have explained it all.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.000]   You should have said something like,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.080]   it looks like you're trying to play the guitar.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   Right.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.920]   Did you need to play the guitar?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.120]   Microsoft would have done that.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.320]   OK, here's--
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.640]   This is the New Guglinson, yes.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   Here's where we violate copyright,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.800]   and probably get this video pulled off of YouTube,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   ironically--
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.600]   That's all right.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.760]   --because it's a YouTube video of a guy doing Beatles music.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.880]   Like, that guy with really good voice.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.280]   Yeah, a guy with really good voice.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.320]   You don't want to miss that.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.400]   He's actually the lead singer of the band after Edmund.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.800]   The Google guitar, thought I'd play a song.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   So he's actually a--
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.000]   Don't make it better.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.200]   Take a sad show, and make it better.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   Remember, to let her into your heart.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   OK, so for people just tuning in,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.200]   you might think this is kind of dumb
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.160]   until you realize he's doing this with the Google search
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.800]   page.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   With the logo.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   The logo.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.680]   I think the Google logo.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.520]   It's crazy.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.560]   Better than Pac-Man, I'd say.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.360]   Really?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.480]   Should we say it's the best Google Doodle of all time?
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   Mm.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   Mm.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   Mm.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.600]   Maybe I take Pac-Man better than Pac-Man.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.920]   If you're in position--
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.520]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.600]   Pac-Man had a habit of, like, starting to play the Pac-Man
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.720]   music when you weren't expecting it to, which I've said a lot
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   of people.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.360]   Yeah, that was a little annoying.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   Google Pac-Man's the only one that survived, though, right?
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.280]   The Google actually saved.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.120]   No, all the logos have been saved.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.640]   Really?
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   Google, even when Google doesn't say, oh, here's our special
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.520]   save place.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.720]   You just go to their special Google logos page.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.640]   A search for Google logo should bring it up.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.120]   And then you go to the page, and all their logos are there,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.200]   and they're lifted by date.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.360]   And that's their current location.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.320]   [SQUEAKING]
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.440]   Oh.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   I shouldn't really be playing Pac-Man.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.400]   So you can go back in time.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.100]   That's another great tip from Danny Sullivan of search engine
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.440]   plan.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.360]   So you search by date?
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   Just search for Google logo.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.580]   And then the first page, you should
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.360]   say something like Google Holiday logos, which is, again,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.480]   sort of a dumb name for it.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.840]   But that's where you can go through and see all the different
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   logos that they've done.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.680]   Oh, look at this by year.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   And then the countries as well that way.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.480]   They should have links to some of the interactive ones that
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.080]   kind of come up that way.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.960]   Interesting.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.080]   Yeah, they were originally holiday logos, weren't they?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.680]   But I mean--
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.020]   In fact, I did this post.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.380]   I guess it was like all the Google logos, I think,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.100]   it'll bring it up.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.100]   These are fan-backed.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.780]   I can finish up.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.340]   But I did this post.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.340]   You can search for it.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.180]   It's called those special Google logos, sliced and diced.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.620]   And I did it about a year ago.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.020]   And I actually went through and categorized all the logos
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.380]   by what was the most popular holiday
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.220]   and what was the most favorite national day that was celebrated.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.780]   And I need to finish picking up the project.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.700]   I don't know.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.560]   Because I don't know.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.960]   I just like to do it.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.120]   But they've got all these crazy logos.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.360]   And the one thing that you'll find when they do this is the logos
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   never happen on any time that you would expect.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.280]   This was like what?
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.160]   The 92nd anniversary of Liz Paul, right?
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   And then they'll do something for the 23rd anniversary,
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.800]   the 72nd anniversary.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.080]   And it's really rare for them to actually do something
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.840]   like on the 100th or the 10th.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.660]   I was surprised they didn't do anything for IPV six day
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.720]   last week.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.520]   I thought I said they were behind it.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.320]   They'll celebrate the third anniversary of that.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.400]   It was IPV six day.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.720]   This is a great article, Danny.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.840]   You know what I'm sad about?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.740]   And you must be sad about this too.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.440]   When I did a search for those special Google logos,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.060]   I got the very first thing I got.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.560]   Looks like a demand media site.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   Oh, no.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.160]   Technews.am, is that you?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.640]   Wah, wah, wah.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.360]   And then all things D.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.760]   And then search engineland.com.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.360]   See, that's all your personal results.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.520]   I guess something different.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.560]   Oh, is it?
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.360]   Well, I wish they had a minus one.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   Well, I'll just plus one U.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   There we go.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.680]   So you can do that.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.520]   Actually, it's interesting.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.880]   I'm signed out and I get minus coming up second.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.600]   I don't know which one's coming up there.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.560]   I see all things D. But hey, I'll take all things D.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.760]   They were just linking over to us.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.440]   So that was nice.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.320]   That's better than nothing.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.520]   I get Danny first signed in.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.920]   Oh, excellent.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.320]   So why does Google think I'm the cheese ball?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.360]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.760]   You are your Google search results.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.280]   Don't demand that.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.120]   Yes.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.600]   Look at this.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.640]   I've not seen this before.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.040]   Did you see?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.200]   Have you ever seen this before?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.920]   After I plus one did, it said, you plus one this publicly.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.440]   Google's very worried now that, you know, ever since I've
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.160]   only seen some Google buzz that they want you to know you did this.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.240]   I was logged in when I did it.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.440]   That's weird.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   One little complaint for plus one.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.600]   I put on my blog--
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.640]   I'm ashamed to admit, but I put like buttons on there.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.800]   Because you kind of have like buttons nowadays,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.880]   if you want to drive traffic.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.520]   You must use like button standing, right?
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.600]   We have them.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.360]   It's interesting.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.120]   I'm about to do a post where having them on our pages
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.240]   doesn't really--
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.920]   we'd serve out maybe 50,000 impressions in a day
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   and you get 22 likes.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   And--
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.400]   Yeah, that's--
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   Yeah, that's about right.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.400]   I have them there because I think it still makes sense to do it.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.160]   And I think it can help in other ways.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.560]   But I think a lot of the activity for us and perhaps
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.200]   other sites happens on Facebook itself.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.080]   So I put a like button there because I am able in--
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.840]   they have a space in the JavaScript
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.480]   to specify a URL.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600]   See, I have multiple posts on a single page.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.640]   So by specifying the URL to be the permalink for the entry,
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.680]   I can actually have.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.200]   But I can't put a plus one button there
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.000]   because plus one doesn't give me that feature.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.840]   It just takes the whole page.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.520]   So I only could put the plus one button
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.840]   on the specific permalink page, which I do.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.320]   But it's kind of sucky because I'd
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.400]   like to put it on the total blog page where it would be seen
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.480]   far more times, right?
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.640]   Oh, it's just-- yes, it's just like the same mistake.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.120]   That's a-- I just thought I'd say that.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.920]   I know we have a few people listening at Google.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.480]   It'll be fixed by the end of the show.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   It might be.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.840]   Well, you've got to be careful because you
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.000]   have to have the same domain thing.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.960]   Otherwise, you could spoof people.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.840]   Right.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.280]   You have to say, OK, is within the same domain.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.320]   What would be the negative--
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   of spoof?
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.000]   We can put plus one button on a page that
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.480]   will implement something else.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.920]   That's true.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.680]   Good guess about that.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:39.880]   That was happening.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.680]   Though, with Facebook, I think that people
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.640]   were using the Facebook buttons and behind the scenes
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.280]   making it so that if you were clicking on something else,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.080]   Like, if you were--
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.160]   You could specify for the anything button you could
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.680]   specify.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.480]   Yeah, you could specify for any like button a URL.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.280]   Right.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.760]   Right.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.320]   So you can't make it look like somebody likes something
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.840]   other than what they're looking at.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.600]   And if you put some code in that URL, you could do something.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.960]   And if-- for here's an example, let's say I'm Amazon logged in.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.320]   I've got a cookie on Amazon for one click.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.880]   If you put an Amazon buy link in there, would it just go through?
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.800]   Unless they sanitize their inputs, it probably would.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.640]   So there's a flaw.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.240]   There's a flaw.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.720]   And I'm sure what Google's going to say is--
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.800]   no, because a plus one is for a page.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.600]   So if you'd have a plus one button on anywhere on any page,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.160]   you're plus oneing that page.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.480]   Well, Google would say that get is supposed to be item potent,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.040]   because that's the kind of thing Google would say.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.560]   Item potent, is that the phrase?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.480]   Yes.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   I suspect that you didn't think about it.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.840]   I told my wife that last night, honey, I'm item potent.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.640]   You know, Danny, about your sort of low level of likes
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.160]   on your pages, I have this theory that our audience,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.080]   like the geek audience, just isn't as likely to use Facebook.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.160]   I got that sense in conversations at food camp.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.760]   I have a hard time finding developers
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.600]   to work on the Facebook plugin for my open source application,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.360]   because I just have a lot of developers who outright say,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.960]   I don't have a Facebook account, and I'm not going to open one.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.640]   So you know, I don't know.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.280]   It's just kind of a theory.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.000]   But that seems like a very low level of activity
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.920]   on your site.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.800]   But your site targets a pretty geeky audience.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.560]   They're too geeky.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.400]   Yeah, well, it's weird.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.240]   I mean, what surprised me is that you will get some posts
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.400]   that will have hundreds of likes on them.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.640]   But those are posts that have gone viral on Facebook itself,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.840]   independently of the site.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.200]   I see this with LinkedIn, right?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.760]   We have huge amounts of traffic coming in from LinkedIn.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.440]   We don't have a single LinkedIn button on the site.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.520]   You know, I'm going to change that,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.640]   just because I'm feeling bad about it now.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.480]   But there's this whole activity that's
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.960]   happening on LinkedIn that's working independently
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.480]   of the buttons.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.320]   Facebook, you know, and I talked with them about it.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.400]   They were like, well, you've got to be even more social,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.960]   and you need to have the like buttons at the top
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.640]   and at the bottom.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.880]   And it's leading me to the point of thinking,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   I'm just going to write articles that are nothing but a giant
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   like button, and maybe that will do it.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.520]   That sounds like a good social media strategy, Danny.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.320]   I just try that.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.840]   A giant-- every article is a giant like button.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.520]   Actually, the most likes I ever got
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.720]   was on the post where I said, I'm going to put a like button
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   on here.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.200]   But I do not like it.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.000]   And I got 188 likes on that one.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.880]   So I don't know what the hell's going on.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.720]   By the way, thank you.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.160]   Our chat room has said there is a way in the advanced portion
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.000]   of the-- let me see if I can find it here.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.080]   Where is it?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.000]   And there it is.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.080]   And the advanced-- so these are the ad plus one
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.600]   to your website, google.com/webmasters/plus1/button.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.040]   And if you go to advanced, you can actually
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.160]   put a URL in there.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.280]   And since I could put some-- it looks like I could put arbitrary
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.960]   PHP in there.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.600]   I'll be able to put the PHP code for the permalink into that.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   So I guess I can fix this.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.840]   So Google did know about it, unless they just added it.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.040]   I think you did not.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.800]   I think it was there, and I just didn't notice.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.680]   So thank you for correcting me.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.440]   I was wrong.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.160]   So would you say not to--
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.440]   It's funny, because Bradley Horowitz was coming around
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.400]   with plus one buttons at food camp.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:18.880]   Did you get one?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.160]   Real?
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.200]   Yeah, little lapel pins.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.120]   And when he gave me mine, I said, I like that.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.240]   And I thought, oh, that shouldn't have said that.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.200]   That was probably a mistake.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.240]   So yesterday, Danny, Google had a live event
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.800]   announcing some interesting new features in search.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.200]   And we had cupcakes, too.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.440]   And you live-blogged it, of course.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.480]   I did.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.600]   Yeah, the announcements came kind of fast and furious.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.640]   There wasn't anything that was really on its own,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.560]   like this big thing.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.440]   The last time they did one of these big search events,
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.040]   it was for Google Instant, which really was this big, huge
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.320]   change.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.800]   Yesterday, it was a bunch of more incremental things.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.720]   Actually, some of the stats--
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.440]   I thought most interesting were some of the stats
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.800]   that they shared that you're showing there.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.400]   Look at the search traffic by day of week.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.240]   The worst day for search on the desktop is Saturday.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.440]   Yeah, but what he's saying.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.400]   And that was the thing.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.360]   He's saying, you look at that, and you think, oh, well,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:20.800]   it's the weekend.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.640]   Nobody's searching.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.640]   But then when you look at the mobile traffic,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.680]   when the desktop traffic goes up down,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.160]   the mobile traffic spikes.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.800]   But what he was talking about was that basically,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.120]   we're going to continue to search wherever we can go.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.960]   And we're doing it on our devices more, which
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.600]   led into the first part of their analysis.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.760]   So Alice Cooper was right.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.880]   Everybody's searching on the weekend.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.680]   I don't quite remember that way, but--
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   Really sorry.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.560]   Continue, please.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.200]   They should have had him there singing, but that was great.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.600]   That would have been cool.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.440]   That would have been--
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   So that's actually really interesting that mobile just
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.040]   peaks on the weekend.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.160]   That's really interesting.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:00.880]   It was.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.840]   It was very much so.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.000]   And in fact, they did also, by time of day,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.640]   that's the next thing that you see there.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.760]   And you'll see that what happens,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.400]   you get a little lunchtime slump, as they called it.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.440]   And it came up lunchtime.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.400]   So everybody is going off to eat.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.760]   But then when they went to the mobile,
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.320]   and then in the evening, nobody's searching.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.440]   And then the mobile, they said, you see a lunchtime peak.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440]   It was funny.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.320]   And it was saying, everybody's eating with one hand
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.960]   and searching with the other.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.480]   And then it was such a way to have lunch on the--
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   They're searching, where do we go?
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.120]   Exactly.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.200]   Where should we go?
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   Should we go eat?
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.560]   So they rolled out these mobile changes.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.040]   I think the most dramatic thing was, if you go to Google
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.840]   in your mobile browser now at the bottom of the page,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.800]   you get these little icons that say,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   find a local restaurant near you.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.720]   Or find out.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.960]   And that's why.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.720]   It's really interesting.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.080]   It kind of keeps you away from doing the kind of browse
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.200]   type of search.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.640]   And there's some of the buttons that you can see it on there.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.960]   But I can't even find my camera there.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.920]   There we go.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   So I'm going to go to the restaurant and coffee
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   and martinis bars.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.480]   Is that on Google?
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.320]   That's it.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.360]   That's what you get if you go to Google.com in your mobile
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   browser now.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.120]   In fact, here I am on my mobile browser.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.440]   And this is right at the very bottom.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.400]   And you'll see it's saying restaurants, coffee, bars.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.320]   And then there's a little more button.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   And there's just icons.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   And if I click on one of those icons,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.760]   I'll see whatever is what are closest to me.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.280]   I click on coffee.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.240]   And it tells me that Alt-A, which is a nice coffee
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.120]   restaurant around here, is popping up right there at the top.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.720]   And so a lot of these things that you do on your mobile browser,
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.680]   you're not--
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.120]   you're going to do the same things all the time.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.160]   We need a restaurant near me.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.120]   And so that's a common thing.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.320]   And so here's Google not even making you having
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.360]   the type in restaurant you just push a button, you get it.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.080]   It's kind of funny.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.560]   I mean, how many people go to Google.com on their mobile
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.360]   browser that would be my guess?
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.720]   Well, apparently somebody does.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.840]   Yeah, it's definitely well-tinkled.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.800]   You're looking at the search button, right?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.280]   Does it?
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.840]   That's fine.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.520]   I mean, so what I did is I went to Google.com and Safari.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.480]   But if I--
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.600]   but what am I-- no, because that's what I do is when I search.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.640]   So what am I going to search for?
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   Right.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.400]   Search for Captain Crunch and see what you--
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.160]   Did you see that I was searching from Captain Crunch?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.080]   You did.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.760]   And that was because--
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.600]   I don't know if it might.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.080]   There's previous searches, yes.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:17.480]   Yes.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:17.920]   I was--
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.240]   What other serial group are on top of my mouth now?
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.400]   What's going to happen?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.560]   Well, I was worried that they had discontinued Cap and Crunch.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.760]   I had heard that rumor, but it turns out it was just a rumor
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.040]   that still Quaker Oats will continue to make Captain Crunch.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.200]   So I've searched for lunch.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.840]   I'm getting the Wikipedia entry explaining what lunch is,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.680]   which I guess that's OK.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.320]   I'm places for lunch near where I am.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.160]   Aha, look at that.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.640]   That's very good.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.640]   That's the Google Places.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.960]   This is becoming more important.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.360]   Boy, I tell you, you know, you see people--
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.400]   I've just heard about accompanying a show remain
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.040]   in those yellow pages that is charging people hundreds
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.840]   of dollars a month saying we'll drive lots of traffic
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.680]   if you have an online entry at yp.com.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.560]   And you know, if you just Google something,
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.040]   this is really-- this is how people find stuff.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.280]   And it's free.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.400]   Google Places.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   You know, why pay for something?
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.200]   Lunch 2.0.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.560]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.400]   And if you click on any of those entries,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.520]   you see the little preview next to it over there
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.320]   on your right-hand side.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.080]   If you click-- now go back down to one
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.400]   of the actual listings.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.280]   See onto your right--
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.320]   Oh, look, I'm getting previews.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.680]   --the little computer.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.400]   If you click on that, that should let you know.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.120]   You can start flipping through.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.440]   Oh, yeah, that's a nice feature.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.360]   Yeah, that's a nice feature.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.200]   But they stressed it again that you have--
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.760]   this is sort of Google Instant previews.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.440]   They just recently added that.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   I remember we talked about it on the show, yeah.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.600]   So one of the things that they found
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   when they looked at--
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.120]   Search results.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   What is this?
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   Huh?
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.120]   Yes.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.040]   Yes, cool feature.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.960]   Kevin's looking at that.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.480]   Never saw that.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   One of the things--
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.480]   I missed that bit of the demo.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   It's nice.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.280]   One of the things that they found out in stats,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.600]   and they have a graph to show it,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.720]   is that lots of people are using speech now to search
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   on Google Mobile.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.040]   I really love-- I mean, that's-- whoops, make it that.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.560]   OK.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.600]   That's one of the things--
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.680]   And that led into this other thing that they've added,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.160]   which is if you have an Android phone
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.400]   or using the Google app or iPhone,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.440]   you can talk to the phone and it will do the searches for you.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.680]   Android's amazing because you can talk to the phone
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.480]   and do any number of actions.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.720]   Well, I do it all the time.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.400]   I'll hold down the search button and I'll say,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.280]   navigate to someplace I want to go,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.480]   and it's fired up the GPS and directing me,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   you know, within a minute.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.720]   Or send text or send email.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.840]   Is that not less laggy?
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.960]   Because I always used to find it would sit there for ages.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.920]   And you have to slap it for it to work.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.120]   It depends on your connection.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.480]   Sometimes if you have a good connection,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.200]   it's almost instant.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.040]   I find it's been working really well,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   I mean, to the degree that I actually make use of it,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   which is something that they stressed in the talk,
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.440]   which was the more that they get the voice accuracy right,
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.600]   the more that people start to use it more and more
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.440]   and go back to it.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.040]   They feel like I can trust it.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.720]   And so now they brought it to our desktop,
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.040]   which seems kind of weird because I don't quite know
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   that I'm going to be sitting around on my desktop
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.600]   and doing a search and then say,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.880]   oh, I want to talk to my computer
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   and do the search when I have a keyboard there.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.400]   But maybe, you know, and maybe it'll help drive awareness
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.720]   that there's voice search available period,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.480]   which might cause more people to do it
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.800]   on their mobile devices.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.480]   So how do I do it on, is it available now on Chrome?
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.880]   It's not, it's, it's in Chrome 13,
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.000]   which is like the Canary dev channel,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.600]   but you can, and this is my tip,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.800]   but it's fine, I'll come up with it on.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.400]   You can enable it in experiments right now.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.200]   There is a voice experiment that you can enable.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.000]   Oh good, well, we'll save that
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.480]   and we will show you how to do that in Gina's tip.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.800]   (laughs)
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.640]   Anyway, go ahead, Danny.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.480]   I want to hear about the cupcakes too.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.760]   Oh, the cupcakes, I just tweeted a picture of those.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.120]   Is that from Magnolia?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.360]   Where, who are they from?
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.640]   Who's the cupcake company out here?
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.880]   Citizen cake, Citizen cake, right?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.440]   Is it?
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.640]   No, let me see.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.480]   What?
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.800]   We probably have different ones down south.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.720]   I'd have to look them up.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.120]   Where's down south?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.120]   Down south of California?
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.960]   Down south?
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.240]   Well, Gina and I are close in that.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.040]   I'm in Orange County, she's in San Diego somewhere.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.960]   Yeah, San Diego.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.200]   Where's the cupcake?
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.920]   Eileen, where's the cupcake place in San Francisco?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.120]   Do they have one in Mountain?
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.960]   Where was the event?
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.040]   Was Danny, was it in San Francisco?
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.920]   It was, yeah, it was at the Europe Abuelana Center
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.120]   for the Performing Arts.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.280]   Oh, yeah, those are some good looking cupcakes.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.120]   Yeah, nice.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.960]   You find it?
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.640]   Is there any search engine in the end?
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.480]   I got it.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.320]   I was just gonna talk about it in pages,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.160]   but I had to see it.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.840]   it's lunch time.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   I want to go, you gotta see the cupcake.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.880]   (laughs)
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.240]   It was, actually, I got the Twitter, you know,
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.560]   doing their own image hosting now.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.600]   And I just saw it pop up for the first time today
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.440]   that I could do it from within my Twitter account.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.120]   So I thought, oh, I'll throw some cupcakes out there
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.960]   and see how it goes.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.680]   So it's Twitter, I gotta go to Twitter.com.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   What's your Twitter handy?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.280]   It's, Danny's Olga, Twitter.com/dannyzolop.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.120]   And then if you pick, pick.twitter.com,
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.880]   yeah, that's the first time I've seen that.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.520]   Yeah, they just launched that, huh?
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.480]   Yeah, so they said they would be rolling it out
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.240]   to people over the coming weeks.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.280]   And so I saw, I'm like, wow, I've got a little photo button.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.200]   I can upload this.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.640]   So I probably should go back and do a blog post,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.880]   but I figured somebody had already done that by this point.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   So it should just appear.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.360]   If you keep going, it was really--
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.200]   Do I have to click it?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.400]   It was a problem book.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400]   You have to click it, I think.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.080]   We're going to talk about those Chromebooks in just a bit.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.640]   Did Marissa Mayer invest in a cake company?
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.480]   (groans)
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.760]   No, I think you're right.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.600]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.800]   See where it says, hey, and then if you click
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.120]   on the little button to the internet, there are--
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.960]   Ooh.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.400]   Yeah, those are yummy and branded.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.240]   Inside search.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   (laughs)
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   Isn't that great?
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.720]   I brought you home for my kids, actually.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.760]   I managed to get them into my bag into a cup
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.600]   and they didn't know if they could eat the things on the top.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.440]   I said, no, you're safe.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.440]   Google's not going to poison you.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.880]   It's all delicious.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.680]   Even the little badges.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.480]   Now, see, the other thing you could do is you could take
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.720]   that picture and that was the thing I thought was most
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.920]   interesting with the search by picture feature
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   they rolled out yesterday.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.600]   And this lets you literally take a picture,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.680]   you can drag it and drop it into the search box on Google
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.400]   and it will go out and find other pictures
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.240]   that seem to be similar to it.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.640]   And it's kind of neat.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.080]   If you've got, say, some place that you've been at,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.120]   you're not quite certain where that is at located at,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.280]   it may find matches or may find other kinds of things
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.120]   that match.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.160]   Sometimes it gets it horribly wrong, but it's not perfect.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.960]   And that's supposed to roll out to everybody
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.600]   over the coming week.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.480]   You'll know when you get it, they said, because you'll see
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.280]   a little camera icon that will appear when you're at Google
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   Images.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.880]   And there's some extensions and other things
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   that you can do to--
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   Oh, sure.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.960]   That was going to search for cupcakes.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.800]   Did you get a chance to try that out?
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.040]   Did they roll into the focus of attendance?
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.120]   I have it.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   See, camera icon.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.480]   You can have it all.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.000]   I don't even have it.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.480]   Let me drag cupcakes here.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.440]   Oh, whoa, let's get some more cupcakes.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.720]   Let's see how it's going to do this.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   Pick.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.560]   Whoa.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.800]   Uploading file, that's kind of cookie.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.520]   And now thinking--
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.920]   I am turning green right now.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.760]   I may have crashed it.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.080]   OK.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.560]   There you go.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.960]   OK, now what?
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.880]   Nothing.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.040]   Got some errors.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   Let's go back to--
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.600]   I mean, I played with a bunch of things.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.200]   I pulled a bunch of pictures off my blogs of places
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.080]   like when I was in Alaska, just like a mining village.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.240]   And I dropped it in there and it found the location.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.200]   So it did work pretty well.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   And then there were occasions where you're like, wow,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.680]   you totally didn't get that right at all.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.800]   It kind of didn't--
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   It's broken right.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.360]   So places-- identifying places seem to be the thing
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.200]   that they demo, the thing that they kind of pointed out
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.920]   is the use case.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.000]   But I'm wondering about things like plants, animals,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.160]   like food-- are the limitations similar to Google Goggles,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.240]   which says basically we're not so good at plants and flowers,
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.680]   but we are good at other things?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.440]   It seems to be.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.400]   They didn't say that there was any particular thing it was
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.080]   good or necessarily bad at.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.480]   It really seemed to be if there are a lot of pictures that
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.200]   are similar to what you're looking for,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.720]   it'll probably have a better chance of finding something.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.800]   I asked them specifically about facial recognition.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.200]   And you know what I bet's happening?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:06.760]   Is that logo breaking?
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.440]   It's that stupid logo is breaking it.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.200]   Google Doodle is breaking image search.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.760]   But they're not doing facial recognition
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   where they're trying to really go and--
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.320]   I don't want the eclipse!
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.200]   Go away!
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.040]   But they are-- like in one case, I
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.320]   gave it a picture of some smokestacks that were at an angle.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.400]   And it couldn't find where that was located at.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.840]   I'd get it-- I'd done it in a sepia tone or whatever.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.000]   And it matched some photos that were amazingly
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   of the same kind of colored background.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.480]   So it's looking for color matches, certain kind of pattern
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.800]   matches, and other things, which is why you kind of get
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.560]   the misses that come up in some times.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.120]   It says-- now, because I'm using an experimental version
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.320]   of Google Search, should I turn that off?
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.920]   Yeah, turn off-- like leave all your experiments.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.560]   Like a plus one.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   So just leave my experiments.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.600]   Image search for the experiments.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.280]   No, instant on images.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:03.960]   No.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.680]   So let me-- OK, now I am a kind of like vanilla Google
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.120]   experience.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.680]   Let's go back to google.com.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.520]   So he doesn't say, OK, no, OK.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.440]   Let's see this.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.080]   I think it-- I think that's what's breaking it,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080]   is that slider.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.880]   Can't go back to images.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.720]   Still have the little camera.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   See, search my image.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.560]   I want that camera so bad it hurts.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.960]   I don't know why I lucked out.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.880]   OK, I'm dragging cupcakes because I want more cupcakes.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.680]   I sure don't have it.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.280]   Oh!
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.080]   Oh!
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.480]   It was-- oh, the cupcakes are all people.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.280]   Oh, but definitely color matching it all up there.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.560]   Cupcakes like people.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.960]   Yeah, let's do that again.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   Let's do that again.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.480]   OK.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.840]   Let's do that with one of us.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.280]   So here's Van Gogh's starry starry night.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.360]   Let's see what happens there.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.840]   Here's the ones they guarantee to work.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.800]   And look, yeah, that's the ones they-- look, similar images.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.560]   They're all the same.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.200]   I just tried goggles on a picture of the plant behind me,
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.600]   and it finds similar looking plants.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.040]   But--
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.520]   That's good.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.440]   Let me see if I have other--
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.160]   But basically the same color, actually.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.920]   Grab anything on your desktop and throw it in there.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.160]   Yeah, well, just see what happens.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.480]   Here's a picture of Twitter.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.560]   So the results are--
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.960]   Oh, a guest Twitter.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.400]   Oh, no, I see.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.240]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.600]   Well, of course, it had that in the name.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.360]   Oh, no.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.640]   Let me get a picture of me.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.120]   This is the ultimate vanity search, right?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.720]   Exactly.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.040]   Let's see.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.880]   I go to images, search for Leo Laport.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.560]   OK, now I've got a picture of me.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   Let's get a good picture.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.320]   OK, I'm going to drag that to the desktop.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   Oh, you can drop it there.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:26.840]   I could just do it--
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.680]   Yeah, you can find me.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.560]   You should be able to right click and search.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.680]   There's a bunch of other extensions and ways to do it, too.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   When you have the Chrome extension of the Firefox
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.040]   extension, it's very nice because if you're on a website
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.760]   with a picture, you can right click and tell it search by picture.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.080]   I can't really drag--
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   There you go.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.440]   There it is.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.920]   Drop image here.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.960]   It guessed my name.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.840]   Got lots more images.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.520]   Well, that works.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.280]   That actually, I think that's kind of cool.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.320]   Yeah, those are images from that same shoot, right?
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.920]   Leo, it looks like a different job.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.760]   Yeah, they are.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.360]   It's not only-- yeah, they're from the same shoot.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:01.880]   Huh.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.080]   Makes sense.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.440]   I mean, if you use Picasso, you end up--
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.920]   it ends up doing that, right?
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   Right.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.480]   When you give it one face, it'll recognize
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.800]   the faces from the same sequence
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.920]   because the lighting and the hair and everything
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.320]   was similar enough that it would know it.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.280]   It takes a while to get the more generic ones.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.360]   Trying to drag these.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.520]   I don't know why I have so much trouble dragging stuff.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.560]   All right.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   Well, anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.520]   I'm just sitting sidetracked here,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   but I just think that's kind of cool.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   This is a twig tradition.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   Ego searches are a twig tradition.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.600]   It's OK.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.160]   This is why I say the one with a beer belly
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.360]   is photoshopped that is not really me, just so you know.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.760]   It's looking like it uses some text as well.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.280]   I mean, like the tags and so forth.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.560]   But that wouldn't make sense.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.000]   It should use every bit of the thing you can use.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.520]   It's actually doing dual location
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.880]   by looking inside the image for the dual location tags.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.800]   Why not?
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.920]   Anything else they announced?
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.800]   What else do they announce?
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.680]   I think the last thing, if I remember correctly,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   was they did this Google Instant pages, which
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.720]   is where they will preload or prerender a page
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.040]   that they think you're going to click on in the search results.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.440]   How do they do?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.680]   Well, they're guessing.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.680]   I mean, they're doing a search and--
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.000]   I think it's not one.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.880]   It's the top one, which is most likely what you're
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.240]   going to click on.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   They're not doing it, though, for every search.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.680]   So it's a bit weird between when they think you're
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.600]   more likely to do it.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.960]   And I suspect when they think it's worthwhile pulling down
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.440]   data from a website that might not mind them doing it.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.800]   But basically, behind the scenes,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.440]   they're loading up probably the first page
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.720]   in the search listings, guessing that you're
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.600]   going to click on it.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.320]   And so that when you do, the page is right there.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.160]   You're not waiting for everything to load up.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.800]   And it's similar to how they had been working through Fire
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:55.560]   POC to do prefetching, which was they pulled the first page
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.320]   in the search results HTML code.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   But then all the images would still have to come in.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.440]   And when the Fire folks got in trouble for that, didn't they?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.600]   I mean, people yelled at them for that.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.560]   Yeah, they did.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.800]   Everybody yelled at everything at first.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.840]   So that's what I was saying about item code.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.680]   So I was just going to explain what that actually means.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.480]   The way when you do an HTTP get, it's
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.400]   supposed to not matter if you do the same get,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.680]   you should get the same thing and it shouldn't have side effects.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.160]   That's what item potent means.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.520]   And so if you build your pages properly,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.560]   it shouldn't matter whether you fetch the same page twice
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.960]   or get it from a proxy or anything like that.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.560]   It should be the same thing.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.520]   And the problem is if you use a get to actually have a side
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.000]   effect on the server, then you can
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.560]   get into all kinds of trouble on the web.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.760]   Say the server increments a number every time
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.280]   the page is loaded.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.920]   That will increment that number.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.040]   But aren't most pages dynamic now?
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   How does that impact it?
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:52.600]   Well, then the dynamic pages are constructed by running JavaScript
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.120]   after you've done the gets.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.360]   So one of the things they did with this
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   was that it's not just prefetching the page,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.880]   it is actually pre-rendering it.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.400]   So it's doing everything it would do to render that page,
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.520]   just putting it off screen.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.720]   And then when you click, it takes it straight through.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.040]   So that was--
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   So it doesn't do another get at that point?
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.160]   No.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.920]   But this is the thing that Chrome does that Firefox doesn't do.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.880]   It's not just prefetching.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   So just downloading the bits and having them ready.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.400]   It's actually creating the whole rendering surface,
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.320]   doing everything we do, restarting the JavaScript, running,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:19.960]   and so on.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.520]   And one of the demos they did, they showed it,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.160]   where they were clicking on the image,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.880]   and it had some kind of rotating slideshow.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.400]   And the slideshow would have rotated twice
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   before they'd actually clicked through it,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.000]   because the JavaScript is running in the background.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.560]   So if I search for something on Danny's site,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.880]   and Chrome pre-renders in the background,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.480]   because it's the first result, the time it takes me
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.800]   to move my mouse and click on it, it does that.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.920]   If I don't click on the result, it looks to Danny and Danny's
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.480]   logs.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.080]   I have looked at the page when I haven't.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.360]   But yes.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.880]   Unless my analytics tool, or I've done other things
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.360]   to look for the clues that will tell me that, oh, that was just
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.840]   Google pre-rendering the page.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.120]   It wasn't an actual human visitor, of which I haven't even
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   bothered to do yet, because I'm still resting up.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.840]   Can you do that by IP address?
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.680]   How would you do that?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   When I talk with the people about it yesterday,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.520]   they said there were all sorts of technical docs,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.560]   but it sounds like the refer might look different.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.440]   The refer would be Google, right?
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.240]   Well, no.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.080]   It's your browser.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.400]   And when there--
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.320]   It's the browser.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.400]   Your browser is free.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.960]   Pre-fetching and rendering.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.600]   That's what-- I mean, I imagine that Google Analytics has
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:29.960]   this built.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.080]   I mean, if you use Google Analytics,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.720]   I imagine that Analytics has something.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.600]   But basically, the browser has to let the page know.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.080]   A human is actually looking at this somehow when you actually
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.840]   do the click.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.560]   So I'm sure that there's white or Python generated
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.120]   a few files in Google.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.440]   I mean, there's a page visibility API, which
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   lets you tell if the page is actually visible or not, which
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.200]   is also useful if your tab is in front of us.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:57.680]   OK.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.480]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.320]   I mean, if they're pre-rendering the page,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.280]   I don't know that they're then also executing
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.560]   all the JavaScript, which would be what you'd need to have
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.920]   running for Google Analytics to register.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.200]   That's a good point, too.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.960]   The Analytics is part of the page.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.160]   Right.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.560]   And then, for example, if you're using Chartbeat,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.280]   it's constantly pinging back and forth
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.880]   to tell that somebody's there.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   So maybe that's not running.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.400]   But it was like what happened with-- when Firefox
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.280]   first started doing this, and Google and Firefox
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.480]   are doing it, like within the first month,
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.160]   a lot of people were really concerned this
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.080]   was going to mess up their analytics,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.040]   that they were going to get all these things registering
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.480]   in their analytics that were people who really weren't there
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.600]   and didn't click through.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.000]   So when I've done a Google search--
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.720]   Has this turned on on Google Search now?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.120]   I believe it's coming up.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.440]   Not yet.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.920]   Coming up in the next versions of Chrome.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.480]   Chrome 13 and--
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.240]   Chrome 13 and--
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:47.720]   It's a Chrome.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.080]   It's a Chrome Dev Build to save at the moment,
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.040]   I think they said.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.540]   OK.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.720]   So when I look right now as I am at Twitch,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.960]   it's not prefetching anything in Chrome.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.480]   Right.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:56.920]   OK.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:58.920]   So--
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.760]   Yeah, it depends on what--
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.400]   It's like when you click on a link to put it into a new tab.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   It does the same amount of work as it would do to create
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:05.920]   that tab.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.400]   And then when you switch to the tab,
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.440]   it's going to get a good invisible tab.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.880]   And I didn't click.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.720]   I needed to click.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.080]   Which is the significant issue.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.400]   Do you see where this is all going?
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.640]   You no longer have to search, nor either go to websites.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.960]   In fact, if you just turn your computer on--
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   It will go a little too long.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.320]   --stops.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.760]   I think you'll be later--
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   It's a great--
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.640]   Not a good idea.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.040]   Well, I can see where that's going to screw up analytics.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.520]   It is kind of a competitive advantage for Google analytics,
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.880]   isn't it?
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.000]   Because presumably they account for it.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.360]   Well, they don't think they have other--
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.120]   They do it too.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.840]   Yeah, I'm quantcast and com score and all these guys
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.880]   will chart beat.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.600]   I use quantcast, analytics, and chart beat.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.480]   What I should do is compare the three
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.440]   and see if there's a significant difference.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.840]   And web developers can use the prerendering technology
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.040]   on their sites, too.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.600]   You can put a link rel attribute in your HTML,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.440]   which you specify, the page that you think that the user might
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   click next.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   That's good.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.800]   Like if you have a next page of posts or something like that.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.400]   So it's not just for Google search results, which is kind of nice.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.920]   So you can speed up your site, too, if it makes sense.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.120]   That's really cool.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.000]   And you could tell that from the analytics.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.520]   80% of the people go to this page after they go to that page.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.960]   So preload this page.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.400]   Right.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.200]   That makes sense.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.560]   Yep.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.200]   I've preloaded my Netflix page.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.480]   We're going to take a break.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.520]   Danny Sullivan is here from searchengineland.com,
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Gina Trapani from smartaward.org.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.440]   And think up app.com.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.120]   Kevin Marks from salesforce.com.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.840]   Go to his new--
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.000]   what is this chatter.com, Kevin?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.640]   What is chatter?
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.840]   So chatter is like Twitter or Facebook
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.640]   for the people inside your company.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.840]   It basically gives you that stream of updating events
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.760]   that's tied to all the things that are going on internally.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.360]   So you sign up for it with your work-life email address.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   And you can create an internal activity stream
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.720]   for the events that you send to each other
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.600]   and any actions you take as part of the business stuff.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   That's actually really cool.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.960]   We are currently using IRC kind of like that.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.240]   We have an IRC, a back channel, an IRC that's always running.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:14.800]   Right.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.280]   That's the sort of classic way of doing that.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.640]   Many sort of web projects work that way.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.240]   But what you've seen is that, hey,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.720]   no one wants to run IRC.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.240]   And also, they like the richer rendering and the links
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.600]   that you get that's more like a Facebook stream.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.800]   Right.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.600]   Well, it's good to have all three of you.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.800]   We'll talk more in just a second.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.560]   You're watching this week.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.760]   And Google brought to you this week by Netflix and Netflix
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.400]   streaming.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.960]   It is the simplest hassle-free way
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   to get movies right away into your computer
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.920]   or your gaming system, your console, your Roku box,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.800]   your Apple TV.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.920]   Pretty much everybody.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.440]   This is the gold standard for streaming now.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   I mean, if you're selling a box or a TV that
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.120]   has internet connectivity, you've got to support Netflix.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:03.920]   Watch instantly.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.680]   And I just love it.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.520]   Tens of thousands of wonderful movies.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.080]   I never plan ahead anymore.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.440]   I don't have to.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:10.960]   I get home.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.320]   And I know I'm going to have a great movie waiting for me
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.680]   or a great TV show waiting for me.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.040]   Every time I go here, there's something new, which is also
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   kind of fun.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.880]   I want you to try it out for free for 30 days.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.440]   This is $7.99 a month.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.920]   But you could try it free for 30 days
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.240]   by going to Netflix.com/TwitCancel.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.320]   Anytime, there's no contract.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.080]   It's easy to turn off as it is to turn on,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.640]   but you're never going to want to turn it off.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.720]   Xbox 360, PS3, Nintendo, we just looked at all these movies.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.520]   Look at them.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.120]   I love this.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.200]   I don't know how they figured this out,
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.080]   but they know where I am.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.240]   And they say, here's the favorites.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.280]   Here's what people in your town are watching.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.000]   Wild.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.960]   Wild.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.080]   It's really fun.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:54.480]   Netflix--
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.400]   You're talking about taste.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.120]   Yeah, I think we've got Battlestar Galactica.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.680]   These are all the ones I watch.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.920]   I must be the only one using it in my town.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.400]   Shawna Sheep, Parks and Rec, the office.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.840]   OK, Bill Burr, I don't know who he is.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.640]   These are what people in Petaluma are watching.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.760]   Oh, busy town.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.560]   Who doesn't love busy town?
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.240]   And playtime for Kipper.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.080]   So it's kind of interesting to see
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.720]   what your neighbors are watching, isn't it?
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   I actually never really paid any attention to this.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.560]   Netflix.com/Twit to find out what your neighbors are watching
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.840]   and watch it too.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   Free for the next 30 days.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   So that was the search event.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.240]   Danny, you think of worthwhile event?
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.760]   Not as exciting as instant search,
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.400]   but still, that's a lot of new features.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.560]   Mostly Chrome features, though, which is kind of interesting.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.680]   Well, they rolled out--
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.120]   I think it was Search by--
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   I can't remember which one it was that rolled out.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.160]   And it was both for Chrome and for Firefox,
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.240]   but it wasn't for Internet Explorer, which was interesting,
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.800]   because they probably could have supported that easily as well.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.160]   And some of the other things were just Chrome only.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.760]   They'll almost certainly come to the other browsers,
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.080]   though they do tend to do that.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.840]   Right.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.400]   It's inevitable.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.960]   Moving-- I guess we've covered the search event.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:17.800]   Moving on to patents.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.480]   Wow.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.840]   My favorite kind of news story.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.320]   Well, the subject.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.440]   Well, first of all, Apple and Nokia
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.160]   settled their longstanding fight back and forth,
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.200]   both are seeing, suing each other.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.520]   Looks like Nokia won this round.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.680]   Apple will be paying them a large undisclosed amount,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.960]   enough to change Nokia's bottom line,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.520]   they said, in the press release.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.040]   And ongoing royalties.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.880]   I've heard some people say as many as much as $300 million.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:48.440]   Now, we've got to check other patent lawsuits.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.600]   This is a never-ending story.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.640]   Although one of the things that companies do, like Google,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.480]   is they buy patents from other people.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.920]   Google bid for Nortel's patents.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.040]   Probably for defensive purposes, right, Kevin?
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:01.560]   Yes, yes.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.120]   This is primarily what they're after,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.000]   is they want the patents to expand the patent portfolio.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.440]   Because Google doesn't tend to use patents offensively.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.880]   I don't know if they've done that ever.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.040]   But also, their goal is generally just to make sure
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.360]   that they can implement their stuff.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.120]   That just shows you how big a deal this is,
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.360]   because they offered $900 million for the Nortel patents.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.720]   It's almost worth a billion dollars.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.160]   The Justice Department has concluded now that Google
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.960]   could own these patents.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.680]   So they're just making a bet that this will be less
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.440]   than what their future legal fees would be,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.480]   if they didn't have these these defensive patents.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.560]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.680]   It is truly amazing.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.040]   It's sad.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.320]   All that brain power going to this.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.040]   We got it.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.160]   It's horribly wasteful.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.760]   Got to do something about this.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   It's just not like this-- that system's terrible.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.800]   Google has changed it.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.080]   My maps to my places.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.720]   I've used my maps before, because I
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.640]   use that Google tracking program, My Tracks, on Android.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.960]   And then you can save your tracks.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.760]   It was kind of fun.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.680]   I played in a-- we played all day the company Paintball game,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.400]   or I guess it was Laser Tech.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.880]   And I ran My Tracks.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.520]   And it's fun to watch me running all around like this.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.480]   So now, does this mean Hot Pot and Places
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.160]   are now part of Google Maps?
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.320]   I'm not sure what this impact of this is.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.480]   It sounds like they're just trying to simplify things.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.280]   I feel like maps and readers have this problem where
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.440]   there's all these different ways to mark things.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.400]   This is my favorite.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.280]   This is a place I've been.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.320]   This is a place I've rated.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.520]   This is the thing I want to share.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.040]   This is the thing I want to tag and comment.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.720]   And so this particular update to maps,
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   although I honestly haven't looked at it,
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.280]   I don't do a whole lot of curation with maps.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.040]   Just looks like they're sort of simplifying things of like,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.160]   any place that you visited bookmark, rated, or say it to a map.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.440]   Like any place that you've indicated,
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.560]   there's some sort of--
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.600]   Apparently I was in Paris in April.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.560]   Oh, there you go.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.840]   Actually, this might be places you've searched for too, right?
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.200]   Not just places you've been to.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.360]   Although it's pretty interesting.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.880]   I mean, these are all places I've been to.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.560]   And I guess rated or something are somehow indicated.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.040]   Maybe I checked in.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.960]   I use latitude, so I check in all the time.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.000]   Ah.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.480]   Ah, so yeah, you've got a history there.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.640]   Wow.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.360]   I hope this is so cool.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.600]   I want to go make this stuff just easier.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   Like one indicator.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.360]   I'm kind of hoping that that plus one
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.840]   will just be the single canonical way to indicate
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.600]   this is something that means something to me.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.920]   It does tell you, so I've rated, rated, rated, rated.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.440]   This place, I reviewed this place.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.600]   So it does tell you kind of how you came to it.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.320]   Yeah, I've got nothing to do with it.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.040]   I'm going through it.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.000]   And I've done-- it's things that you've mapped.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.920]   I've made a whole bunch of custom maps myself when they--
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.040]   we have like the fourth-- the fourth of July down here
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.800]   gets crazy.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.840]   And so I've done custom maps to explain to people
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.880]   how to get onto our peninsula and get all of it
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.600]   and things like that.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.400]   So I'm looking at it now, and I can see that all that stuff
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.800]   is organized.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.200]   And those were my maps before.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.760]   They literally were just my maps.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.280]   Things that I've starred, although apparently
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   haven't starred anything, so there's nothing there.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.160]   And apparently I've reviewed TechCrunch Ranch.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.760]   Here's the laser tag map that showed up on the list too.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.400]   That's me running around shooting people.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Nice.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.160]   That's awesome.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.480]   It's like modern art.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.480]   Let me see.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.520]   It's really fun when you put the satellite on--
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.160]   oh, nasty.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.000]   Was that you using latitude?
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.920]   It was just tracking it?
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.280]   No, this is something called Google Tracks
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.560]   as an Android app.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.200]   Tracks is crazy.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.560]   My tracks, I love it.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.760]   And so that was kind of fun.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.360]   Hang on, so how do I link to one of these maps?
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.400]   Because I've gone to one of mine.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.560]   I can't find the--
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.520]   Well, they're in-- do you have a mine map?
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.200]   OK.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.840]   And then it also shows stuff you've bookmarked,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.320]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:07.920]   I like this.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.760]   This is kind of fun.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.680]   This is nice to have.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.560]   The things I put on this one seem to have fallen into the sea.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   That's kind of weird.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.840]   You could share it.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.000]   I'll be using my tracks more.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.040]   Share my random walk.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.120]   You had some reviews, Danny.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.440]   The Chromebooks are now available for sale.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.280]   And did you-- you talked a little bit about this
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.200]   on a search engine blog.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.000]   It was mainly-- I've yet to actually play with one myself.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.800]   The new ones.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.600]   I had the CR48 and looked at it.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.440]   And-- but now, you know, everybody has access to them,
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.640]   supposedly, that you can go out and go to either Amazon or Beth
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:46.920]   Buy.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.520]   And if you want one of these Chromebooks,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.960]   you can-- you can show out you're $400 or so--
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.200]   $400 to $500 for them.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.320]   So they're there, although they're not.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.960]   Because as it turns out, Amazon--
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.560]   we were supposed to have both Acer editions and Samsung
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.520]   editions out today.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.680]   And the Acer ones have all been held up.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.800]   And that's kind of important, because the Acer ones
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.960]   are the cheaper ones.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.160]   You can get into an Acer edition for $380.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.240]   And if you're not certain, maybe that $50 difference
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.760]   version is the lower end price of a Samsung one
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.480]   might make a difference.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.160]   So Amazon has one of the six different models
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.760]   that are currently available from either Samsung or Acer
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.000]   that's out there.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.760]   Beth Buy has two of the six total models, which
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.080]   are two of the Samsung ones.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.640]   And the Samsung one's on Beth Buy.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.560]   You can get them either with 3G built in,
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.680]   or you can get them as Wi-Fi built in.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.720]   And so, yes, it's been two and a half years since Google
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.040]   said we were going to have a Chrome OS computer.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.160]   And now they've finally arrived to sleep us off our feet.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.480]   Anybody have one of these?
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.320]   Gina, do you have one?
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.040]   No, not yet.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.800]   I mean, they were supposed to send Google I/O--
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.000]   --to send these on.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.480]   And I haven't got my email or I haven't received it in the mail.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:05.040]   That's a long story about this product launch here, Daniel.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.160]   I'm like, I glazed over.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.480]   I was like, oh, this is Android.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.760]   There are so many different handsets.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.160]   And it's hard to tell, which one's better.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.560]   That's sad that the most inexpensive one, though,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.040]   isn't really available today.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.560]   What surprised me was this is the big launch day.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.240]   And then to go into Amazon.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.880]   And there weren't any real comparisons.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.120]   I couldn't go through and easily see
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.000]   why I would want to go for the Acer versus the Samsung.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.920]   Beth Buy, when you look at the product pages for the 3G
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   and the regular Wi-Fi only one, it didn't make it clear
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.360]   on either of those pages right up top what the differences were
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.320]   between them, which made me think that neither of these retailers--
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.160]   these are your launch retailers--
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.440]   really for whatever reason have gotten behind it,
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.240]   or maybe they weren't prepped enough to get behind it.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.720]   They've had plenty of notice that it was going to be coming.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.400]   So I thought a really good launch day for it.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.640]   And of course, there's nobody to line up in front of the Google
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   store to buy one because we don't have a Google store.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.760]   This reminds me a lot of the Nexus 1 launch,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.560]   where it just kind of goes out into space.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.360]   And no wonder they don't sell stuff by retail.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.240]   But the other thing is the real story here
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.160]   may be what happens in the business and education spaces.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.400]   I could see this for school makes a lot of sense.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.200]   And they have separate programs for that, where they say,
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.880]   if you're a business and you want to deploy these things,
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   you can buy them from us.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.400]   And if you are a school and you want this sort of things.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.080]   And these kinds of devices may make a lot more sense there.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.840]   And the consumer products maybe will never sell that much,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.280]   except for the person who loves their Chromebook so much
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.080]   it worked that they feel like they need to have their own
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.600]   edition of it.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.400]   So it's still watch and see.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.520]   But at least we'll find out what consumers think
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.080]   short enough soon enough.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.320]   I fired up the CR48 when this was announced.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.480]   And updated to the version just to see and play with it.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.080]   It's just like, oh, it's Chrome.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.880]   I mean, it just doesn't feel like a computer.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.380]   It's funny things.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.080]   You know, when you see somebody who's really attractive,
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.600]   you're like, I see why this person is attractive.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.080]   I just don't feel attracted to this person.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.360]   Like, yeah, why other people would think this person is hot.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.480]   But I should call for many.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.160]   That's kind of how I feel about the Chromebook.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.880]   Like, I would buy this for my nephew or for my in-laws.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.080]   I just--
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.680]   It's hard to--
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.960]   So you're saying it's the George Clooney of Netbooks.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.400]   Kind of.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.440]   Yeah, I think Clooney is probably a good example.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.640]   I got it.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   I love it.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.480]   Absolutely.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.200]   When the Chromebook, when the CR48 first came out,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.080]   I mean, I got the demo one and it arrived.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.160]   I wrote my review.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.160]   And I was done writing the review before my kids got home
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.120]   from school.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.880]   So they got home and I said, hey, check it out.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.760]   It's the Google computer.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.320]   Nobody has these.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:50.880]   Go nuts.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.720]   And I talked it their way.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.880]   And it was like, 30 minutes later, they were done.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.480]   They didn't care.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.520]   They were going back for the old MacBooks.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.800]   It's like, I want a computer.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Give me a camera.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.680]   I think they were--
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.200]   It doesn't.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.040]   I think the track wasn't as nice.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.520]   It was a working--
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.080]   The ones that they sent out the CR48s are really kind of rugged.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   They weren't elegant computers.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.800]   They're not like the Chromebooks at all.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.920]   No, and they're nowhere near, like, say, a MacBook Air,
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.280]   which is just a thing of beauty.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.120]   But I think that's one of the hard things, too,
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.960]   is that even if it's supposed to be
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.200]   this different mindset and different kind of computer,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.400]   if I'm using a Mac Air and it's an elegant computer
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.480]   and everything loads up fairly quickly and it's really nice,
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.320]   and I'm not having all the hassles that go with it.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.560]   Like, how do I get things off of my phone?
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.160]   Can I even get the music from my phone to one thing or the other?
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.000]   Because those things haven't gone away.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.760]   You're going to be left underwhelmed.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.600]   And then that may be the case for the next year,
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.280]   until cloud services may be catch up to the degree
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.880]   that maybe you are weaned off of the more traditional computer.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.480]   But that's also why a business or a school
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.920]   might be interested in these, because they do so little.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.960]   Right.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.720]   Well, if you're running a business through the web,
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.040]   then they work.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.280]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.160]   But you need to make sure that you're not--
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.480]   so many businesses start with sort of running
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   some ancient version of DOS or Windows
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.120]   to run their point of sale systems.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.520]   As we see, that transition happened.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.840]   These may make a lot more sense.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.440]   And the pricing's different there, too, right?
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.680]   Because you're not buying the computers you're paying,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.760]   I think, like 25--
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   20 bucks a month.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.720]   --or the month or something for them.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.000]   And you have other costs there, too, right?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.120]   I mean, you're not going to have to upgrade these computers
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.280]   from Chrome 7 to Chrome 8.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.480]   They update themselves.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.120]   And that's a big issue for administrators
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.720]   that have to deal with this sort of stuff.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.800]   For the consumer front, if you're thinking, well,
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.200]   I got $400 to spend.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.760]   And I could probably get myself a Windows computer
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.600]   at that price that does all this other stuff.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.880]   And I can get this other thing.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.720]   And I don't know if I can do all these other things
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.880]   I want to do with it.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.280]   You're probably discounting the fact
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.640]   that, well, did you buy the antivirus software?
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.760]   Would you need that and all the other stuff?
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.280]   And that's probably not factoring into your mindset
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:13.960]   for the cost.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.800]   So what you're saying, Danny, is like,
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.880]   Gina, you're not a Chrome-asexual.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.560]   I'm just not that into you.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.400]   I'm just not into it.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.920]   I don't know.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.920]   I'm not into all computer orientations, but I--
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.520]   And I happily go between both the Mac and the Wii--
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.840]   although I orient more towards Windows.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.680]   But Chrome has yet to stay over my life.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.040]   It's the third species.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.400]   We just don't know what to do with it.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.880]   Third gender.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.640]   And we're going to take a break.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.240]   Come back with more.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.440]   Danny Sullivan is here.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.320]   Kevin Marks, Gina, Trippani.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.640]   And we've got some rumors about the next Nexus, speaking of--
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.120]   Ooh.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.920]   Ooh, the next-- you're going to want this one.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.880]   You're going to want this one.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.920]   Before we do that, though, I want to tell you about squarespace.com.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.880]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   It is really a great way for you to get a website up and running
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.320]   literally in minutes.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.560]   Even a very fancy website with all sorts of connectivity
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.120]   and widgets and so forth is a snap with Squarespace.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:25.760]   So I want you to go to squarespace.com/twig6.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.840]   We're going to have a different URL every month now.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.440]   So squarespace.com/twig6.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.160]   And sign up for the free trial.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.760]   15 days, no credit card required.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.200]   In fact, I'll show you how easy it is.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.120]   You click that green button.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.200]   And all you need is a site name, a password, and an email
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.640]   address.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.280]   And that's it.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.560]   You create your website.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   Now you've got complete access to the Squarespace
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.880]   tools for the next 15 days.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.720]   That means those great 60 plus designer styles,
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.280]   the fantastic social widgets, the Squarespace client
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.480]   for the iPhone and the iPad free.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.360]   You can import directly from your existing site
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.440]   using the classic APIs, movable type, WordPress,
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.080]   TypePad, or Blogger, and Export 2 so you're never stuck.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.040]   And when I say import, I mean, it works even all the
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.040]   Permalinks, all the images, all the comments.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.080]   They all get brought over.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.640]   That's nice.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.760]   They've got all the features.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.600]   Everybody who does websites is looking for photo galleries,
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:24.840]   forms, forums, and a server system that is the most
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.200]   robust in the business.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.440]   It just never goes down.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.640]   And that's what you're getting when you get Squarespace.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.360]   You're getting hosting plus the best software out there.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.120]   Very affordable, two prices at start at $12 a month.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.400]   But I'll tell you what, you sign up for more time.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.960]   It costs even less.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.360]   So really, it's a very good deal considering getting
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.960]   hosting and the best software out there.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.080]   And automatic updates.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.800]   I just went to my WordPress blog and yes, I have another
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.600]   WordPress update I got to apply.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.640]   And then it's 313 and then they say, oh, 132 is going to be
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.560]   out in a couple of weeks.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.880]   And it's like, come on, how much time?
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.160]   I spend more time updating WordPress than I do posting
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.360]   blog posts, not with Squarespace.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.640]   It's all done automatically.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:09.480]   squarespace.com/twig6.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.000]   You may ask why I continue to use WordPress while somebody's
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.280]   got it.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.120]   It's actually how I keep up on what's going on with
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.040]   WordPress, but I'm sorry to think.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:27.280]   So here's the news on what some people are calling the Nexus
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.360]   4G.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.080]   This is from Boygenius Report.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:30.960]   These guys are good.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.800]   I don't know where they get this stuff.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   Boygenius Report is exclusively learned.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.640]   Google's next Nexus device probably called the Nexus 4G.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:45.320]   We'll feature a next generation dual core 1.2 or 1.5 gigahertz
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:51.360]   CPU, perhaps an OMAP 4460 or a Snapdragon 28 nanometer
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.440]   Snapdragon.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.640]   But this is what's interesting.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   720p display.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.840]   No more Android menu buttons at the bottom of the screen.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.400]   We know that because of Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.000]   Everything's going to be software based.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.080]   Forgestas.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.600]   I missedas on the tablet.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.120]   I do too.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   I'm with you.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.520]   I like the physical buttons.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.720]   I want to miss it too.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:21.840]   Or at least the one I have the LG G2X
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.680]   at least has electronic buttons at the bottom.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.840]   But they're buttons, not just on the screen.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   But that's what happens with the new tablets too.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.880]   It's all screen based.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.720]   There's nothing on the front.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.720]   Is it cheaper or just they think that's more modern?
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.480]   Well, you can turn it any orientation.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.320]   That's right.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.680]   It's the orientation thing, isn't it?
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.440]   Orientation doesn't matter.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.680]   It's chromosxual also.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   It goes every way.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.680]   It goes every which way.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   4G radio, gig of RAM.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.680]   This is all from Boy Genius Report.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   It's all a rumor.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   1080p HD video capture and playback.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   That's kind of become the standard now.
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   They say a very good 5 megapixel rear facing camera.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   Delivering class leading image quality and superior low light performance.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   That's one way that the iPhone is really beating Android right now.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.680]   The iPhone 4 has the best camera out there.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.200]   Of course, it'll have a one megapixel front facing camera.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.680]   It will be running ice cream sandwich.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.800]   Ultra thin, Thanksgiving.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.360]   No word about the carriers could be at AT&T.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.120]   I mean, it's been T-Mobile all this time.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.680]   But that T-Mobile AT&T acquisition is in process as possible.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.440]   They're just going to say go straight to AT&T.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:40.360]   And BGR says this will be the flagship ice cream sandwich device.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   I think this will be the first phone that's actually more powerful than my first computer.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.360]   Wow.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360]   Which I got in 1998.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   Wow.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.760]   Yeah, I got to pull out that old receipt.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   I kept the receipt.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.360]   It's more powerful than, you know, it's almost as powerful as my MacBook Air.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   If it's dual 1.5 gigahertz CPs, I mean, in a phone.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.960]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.080]   Gig of RAM.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   In a phone.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.720]   It's just kind of stunning.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.240]   But it kind of doesn't matter.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:16.320]   I mean, it's like the phone is no better than its weakest link, right?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.040]   So we can have dual processors.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.760]   And yet if I can't get the 4G signal, who cares?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   That's true.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   It's not the 3G signal.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.400]   Or if I'm stuck with the 3G signal, but I'm not getting all my throughput in the way
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.480]   that I'd want to have.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.960]   So, you know, it would like the 720p thing kind of confuses me because that's something
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.640]   you hear talked about more on televisions than on computer screens.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.840]   Who's going to watch a movie like this?
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.920]   And I mean, it's like if you take the retina display on the iPhone, that is 720p, right?
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Well, it's not.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.400]   I mean, the P is how much the scan lines are happening.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.000]   Forget the P, but 720p.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   720p, yeah.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.360]   So 720p, so the iPhone is 960p by 640p.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.360]   So it's not that.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   It's not quite.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.440]   So it would even be more than.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.240]   But then when you start looking at, because I've gone through this, I just did a review
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.360]   when I was looking at the droid charge and the thunderbolt and the iPhone.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.920]   And, you know, like the droid charge has a big screen as 800 by 480 or whatever.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.360]   So you can actually see it a bit more.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.880]   But you're always still having the bloke ages up.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.800]   I mean, the screens, they're still going to be so large to the point that even if you
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.280]   had that resolution that you could have all the crisp type, you may very well still need
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.040]   to blow it up anyway to read it unless you're not as old as me, I suppose, or something.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.720]   No, that actually is a very legitimate point.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:40.400]   Because as in this preview that Google's loaded, I mean, yeah, this is on an iPhone.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.520]   There's some great detail there.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   But how am I going to?
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520]   I can't read it.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   I mean, it's there.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   But what am I going to?
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   I can't do.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   I have to pitch.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.440]   But the 4G, if it's real 4G, which to me means Verizon 4G, that would be nice because
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.880]   I just got the Sprint Nexus S mainly so I could have that as a reference phone and so that
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.600]   whenever they roll out Google Wallet, I can play with it and see how that works.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.240]   But you're thinking, this is your flagship phone from Google.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.040]   This should be the benchmark that everybody else wants to go at.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.400]   And it's Sprint 4G, which is better than the AT&T 4G, but it can come in and out.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   It doesn't seem to match the speed I have on my Droid Charge through Verizon, which is
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.400]   4G.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.920]   Oh, by the way, it'd be nice if it had a zoom.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.880]   The Nexus S sort of lacks that.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.480]   I mean, carrier is another issue.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.840]   We're all stuck with these crappy carriers.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.440]   I like the idea of it.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.240]   If it's 720p, I'm going to presume that means 1280 by 720.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.760]   There's no screen on a phone.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.680]   I mean, that would be...
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:49.800]   It'd be nice that I'd also love that if it's LTE, does that mean?
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.600]   And I just don't know enough of this, but if it's LTE, does that mean I can slot in an
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.640]   LTE card from AT&T, then take my Verizon card and slot that in as well?
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.960]   Because that would be a real major change for us in the U.S.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.480]   If LTE means that we can all have SIM cards and we can interact among the different systems,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.040]   they're all on the common thing, but I have a feeling it doesn't quite work like that.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   Oh, I'll buy one.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.320]   I don't care what you say.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.760]   I'll probably buy one anyway.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.700]   What's interesting is you're starting to see some standards like, for instance, all the
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.200]   rumors now that the next iPad will have also have a retina display.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.720]   You're starting to see that that high resolution display is going to be across the board on
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.200]   these devices.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.720]   Fast processors across the board.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.080]   Lots of memory, better cameras.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.800]   These are going to start becoming the standards, aren't they?
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.640]   They become our computers.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   They are really our computer.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.960]   Gina, I'm trying to think the first 1280 by 720 display I had.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.920]   That wasn't that long ago.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   That was pretty recently.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.200]   Of course, it was a 15 or 17 inch screen.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.800]   We're moving ahead fast.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.320]   Other stories in the news, then we'll get to our picks and our tools.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.040]   Samsung Galaxy tabs on first class on American Airlines, starting soon.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.240]   Yeah, I want to know how that works.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   Do you sign in?
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.440]   Do they just hand them out?
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.400]   Do you sign in your Google account?
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.280]   Do you just preloaded with special stuff, including movies?
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.920]   If it's instead of the feedback TV, it's just a benefit.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   It's just a fantastic.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.640]   We've seen this actually for years.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.960]   In fact, I remember seven or eight, nine years ago, there was a company making.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.080]   They were this thick making tablets that they wanted companies to hand out as you got on
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.080]   board.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.080]   It's just easier for them to do that.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.000]   They don't have to have a system that goes throughout the plane for one thing.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   They could just have individuals.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Right.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   It would be like an entertainment console.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.240]   It's not like you get one and sign in your Google account and start checking your Gmail.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.840]   You get to watch movies and listen.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   Well, maybe you can too.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   I don't know.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840]   That remains to be seen.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.480]   If you put the wife on the plane, that would definitely work.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:59.560]   I was actually using that tablet when I was driving up to Sebastopol and the Twit College
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:05.600]   as my in-car nav system with the external Verizon Wi-Fi thing.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600]   It was amazingly good.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.400]   The only problem was it wasn't actually attached to the car and it kept falling off.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.680]   Having the Google navigation stuff on something that big was really nice.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680]   I agree.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.880]   In the iPad, there's a GPS, third party GPS program called MotionX GPS.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.800]   It's easily the best GPS ever used.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.200]   Having that much real estate makes a huge difference.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   Wow.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   Love it.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.200]   But particularly with the Google nav stuff and the search bill, it's like, "Oh, I need
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.200]   to find this thing."
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   Oh, there it is.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   Right.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200]   That's right.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   This is the ultimate.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   This is the part.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200]   We'll have some in the passenger seat.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.680]   It's an information tool.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680]   Let's see here.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   What else?
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   Oh, this is going to be very interesting.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.400]   There's a new Senate bill just proposed that would increase the fines for lip syncing on
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.960]   YouTube, actually not fine, the penalty for lip syncing on YouTube to 10 years.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   In jail.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   What?
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.800]   There's trying to make it criminal again.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   They're trying to make it criminal again.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   This is...
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.280]   This is the thing we're talking about on Sunday.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.640]   We're saying that when they were seizing domains, they were alleging criminal copyright
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.480]   infringement, which is actually a civil offense.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.840]   So they were seizing domains on the basis of a law that hasn't passed yet, which is
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.840]   pretty scary.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.400]   Well, they want to have a law now.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:26.560]   For lip syncing, this is just in case you want to follow this through the Senate.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.720]   I can't imagine it will pass.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.600]   It's going to be called the really vanilla-y war.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.360]   You could say it's a bad taste, but 10 years in jail.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.440]   Now, that's really in bad taste.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.240]   SB 978 is proposed.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.440]   Let me see if I can find this here.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:47.560]   Bill to amend the Criminal Penalty Provision for Criminal infringement of a copyright and
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560]   for other purposes.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.600]   Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, proposed it.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.040]   Now, this is brand new.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.880]   So, you know, I just want to give you some warning.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:07.080]   It would make it illegal to upload lip synced videos among many, many other things.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.480]   It's kind of shocking.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.480]   Is it a reading Sarah Palin's email?
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.920]   Did you see this?
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   This is the Sunlight Foundation.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.440]   That was a weird segue.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:38.520]   Is it the Criminal
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.920]   They did a Freedom of Information Act.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.240]   The state of Alaska said we can't give them to you electronically.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.760]   So for $700, you can print out all 20,000 emails.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.560]   So the Sunlight Foundation has scanned them, indexed them, and put them online.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.240]   It's called serasinbox.com.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:01.600]   They have some sample searches that I quite enjoyed, including Flippin' Believe It,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.480]   Bridge to Nowhere, Tina Fey, Horrible People Are Bringing You Down, Alaska Natural Gas
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:15.120]   Pipeline, Barack Obama, Crud, First Dude, Who Leaked It, What a Dumbass He Is, and Who's
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   Gonna Trim My Air.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.040]   It's a very Gmail-like interface, actually.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   It's a Gmail-like interface.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.120]   I love this.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   You can just read through email.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   It is.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   They even have like the Gmail, older, oldest, 3,770 messages.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.680]   You know, I don't know if you want to spend a lot of time going through it.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.840]   Let's see the Tina Fey one.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.040]   Here it is, Governor Sarah Palin, she's ceasing her assistant.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.800]   Oh, actually, this is from her assistant, Pat Galvin.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.960]   My suggestion is you offer to go to the Saturday Night Live and play Tina Fey, and you interview
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.360]   her as she plays you.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.200]   And then you can go back and read the thread.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   I mean, it's just silly.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.440]   Yes, it's silly.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.840]   It's an interesting look through, you know, for about two minutes.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.200]   It's kind of fun to run some of those example searches.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.800]   But Kudos to the Sunlight Foundation for creating an interface that we all know how to deal
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.360]   with versus scanned documents.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.560]   They scanned and they used OCR, so you'll get some weird typos that'll say, "Sent from
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.600]   my blackberry with a couple of different, you know, an extra E at the end."
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.760]   But still kind of fun to flip through.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   I told my wife about it.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   She said, "How is that legal?"
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.840]   I said, "She was the governor."
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.520]   She was using her state government email.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.160]   Yes, state email is a matter of public record.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.200]   Well, maybe think when you're looking at that too.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.120]   It was so crazy that they were printing out these emails.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.560]   I mean, what a joke, right?
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.280]   Oh, 700 bucks is set.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.320]   But you almost wondered, like, well, maybe, you know, if you're dealing with public emails
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.640]   like that, then this is all being done through a Gmail interface and anybody can search through
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   anyway.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.280]   The problem is, of course, you've got the sensitive information that can't be out there.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   Right.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   Exactly.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.520]   But it could be that on a daily basis, you go through the emails and you tag the things
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.800]   that are for public record and you just throw it out there.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.640]   And then, you know, we don't have to go through this sort of stuff.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   Maybe you can read through whatever they want.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   Speaking of...
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   It's all public.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.680]   Speaking of snooping, it's always fun when a company goes public.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.960]   You can read the S1, the document that's offered to investors.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.160]   We've had fun with Groupons.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.200]   Now it's time for Pandora.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:21.480]   Pandora had its IPO this morning.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:29.600]   Big valuation, closed at 17 bucks, up 8.9%.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.200]   The original IPO price was 20 bucks.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   So...
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   20 bucks.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.040]   14.7 million shares.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.080]   Problem is that Pandora has not been making any money.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.680]   And there's a big kind of balloon payment coming up on Pandora.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:57.360]   The price of the music that they offer is going to go up quite a bit soon.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   A number of analysts said Pandora's stock price was inflated.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:06.880]   Morningstar said it was worth $6 a share.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.080]   Maybe the bubble never got inflated.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.080]   I like Pandora.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.080]   I love it.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.520]   I have to pay for themselves from day.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:23.440]   The problem is this licensing deal that they've got is going to really kill them soon.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440]   And you know this.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.440]   They've been fighting...
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.440]   And Tim Westergren, who's great.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   I love him.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.040]   The guy I've found at the company, has really been fighting the good fight to keep licensing
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.600]   costs down on internet radio.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.800]   And his sort of one has sort of managed to keep them down.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:43.800]   But the costs are going to go up dramatically very soon.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.160]   Moving along, we'll wrap this up here before we get to our tips.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   New York City.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   Go ahead.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160]   So I was just mentioned turntable.fm.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.000]   I don't know if you guys have been playing with that.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.760]   You know, I just tell me about it because I just logged in and you have to have a Facebook
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.400]   friend who's using it.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.880]   I guess I got in because of you.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.320]   So what it is, is you go to a room, I made a twig room, go in the twig room.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.080]   And there are people playing music.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.600]   There are DJs on the stage and people on the ground.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.520]   It takes a little world to load it and it's not playing whatever I'm playing.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.160]   And you add music to your list up there on the ride.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.720]   And then you can step up on stage and play music for each other.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.560]   Little art of noise.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.040]   Good choice.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.400]   And you take it in turns basically, the people on stage, it rotates round and you can say,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   I like this, I hate this.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   And you definitely will hate it.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400]   I like this.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   There's a lame and an awesome button.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   I'm going to press it.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   Awesome.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.200]   That got me a point, you see.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.200]   Who else?
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.200]   What is it that you're playing as in here?
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   Yeah, I just have to.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   I'm in here.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.640]   There's SIRME and Eileen, our producer.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   This is cool.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.120]   So I can add a song, but do I have to have the song?
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.440]   Oh, it could just be anything in their library.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.080]   So there's stuff in their library, all you can upload things that aren't in their library.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.520]   So I can play like stuff I recorded myself.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.880]   So I'm going to search for a song and the propeller heads, this seems to fit in.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.560]   I'm going to add history repeating.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.280]   So then the next song will be whoever is next in the queue.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280]   Yes.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280]   That's cool.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.320]   And so it's, and they don't know.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   They're all illegal.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.280]   They're illegal because they're using the same license thing as Pandora does.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.520]   So what happens is they won't let you just play songs to yourself in the room.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.320]   So the rule with this cover up is complicated, but it basically means you can't know what's
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   coming up.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   I like this.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.520]   And you can't play the same artist more than end times an hour or whatever it is.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.440]   There's a whole bunch of stupid rules like that.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   And Pandora came up, which was designed to stop you setting up request lines.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.840]   Pandora set it up so they have their music DNA thing, which is you give them an artist
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.320]   and they have to find artists that are like them because they can't keep playing that
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320]   artist.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.160]   So this is another twist on that same game around the same set of rules, which is you
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.520]   rotate around five of you.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.320]   And the fun part of it is when you do exactly what you were saying, oh, that reminds me
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.320]   of X.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.280]   Here's one that I think we'll go along with that.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.440]   I could see spending a lot of time in here.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.440]   And the other thing we've seen with this is that lots of people are doing it for, for
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.200]   example, if they're a startup and they've got people in different places, they just have
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.080]   a room, they play music to each other.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.840]   And then they just log in and use the chat for that the same way you might use an IOC
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   or something.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.000]   And when you say something, it pops over your head.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   So we've got five DJs.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.680]   What happens after your song is done?
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680]   Do you move off or?
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.480]   No, no, you can stay there until you decide to leave.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   So a total of five.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.600]   And last one, it becomes the room admin, yeah.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.760]   Oh, this is me.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   It's very nice.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.880]   And it's basically, maybe Pandora can have enough money to go and buy these guys and
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.880]   make it scale a bit better because they were running out of service space.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.520]   I think they were casting signups for a bit.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.880]   So this is turntable.fm.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.240]   You can ask for an invite or if I like it because it uses Facebook Connect.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.960]   If your Facebook friends, any one of your Facebook friends is already a member and I
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.320]   presume, does Kevin, you were, I was able to do this.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320]   That's right.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.320]   You jump in.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.480]   And so it spreads virally through your Facebook friends, which is kind of neat.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.200]   The other thing is when you log in and you look at the list of rooms, it puts ones that
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.360]   have got your friends in at the top, then it puts ones for the most people in.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.440]   And the agent says that lots of companies have made their own rooms like Simple Geo Media
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   Temple.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.720]   So it's very neat thing.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.640]   We'll have to have a Twit company room.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.920]   Love this sign better way.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.960]   If actually every room turns into dubstep unless you're policed and carefully.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   Really?
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   Is that true?
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.760]   All songs lead to dubstep.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   Is that that's my son would be thrilled to hear that.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   He's a dubstep.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.760]   He goes to this.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.960]   I'm so excited to be living in this.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.960]   So I show you.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   And they're dubstep fans too.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.600]   Sign into it and play a handful.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.040]   The kids today love the dubstep.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   I don't know.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.240]   That's actually pretty good.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240]   Have you heard my son's music?
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.920]   I went to the GitHub conference and they played it like the whole entire time and then
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.880]   I started listening to dubstep and door station.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.040]   It's great to code to.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.520]   I find myself photos stomping around and very authoritatively committing changes.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520]   It's good.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520]   Really?
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.400]   The most popular room on here is coding soundtrack which has always got over 100 people in it
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   and is mostly dubstep.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   And it's for coding.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.560]   The idea is this music to code to which is that you can't have lyrics that disrupt you
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.080]   because you start timing the lyrics.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.000]   By the way, all of us listening to music is not killing your bandwidth.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   It's not going to be a moment.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.320]   Kevin, you've got to turn it off now.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.960]   I'm trying to find my...
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   Is that super?
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   I'm trying to find my...
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.520]   She chose that room.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.440]   Sons music here because I'd like to play some dubstep for you.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.440]   We'll save that for later.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.840]   Wow, that's cool, Kevin.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.120]   Thank you for sharing that with us.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   That's really neat.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.200]   New York City, Twitter, Capital of the World.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.200]   Facebook hires.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.200]   I'm just going to go through a few of them.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   What?
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   What?
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   You talk to trash about my hometown?
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   Didn't say Brooklyn.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.600]   It's Twitter, Capital of the World because New York City is the Capital of the World.
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.600]   Okay, thank you.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.600]   Okay, thank you.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.600]   All right.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   Hey.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.600]   They continue.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   Carry on.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.400]   Pretty obvious, isn't it?
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:22.040]   Facebook hires former White House Clinton White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.400]   Do you care about the Webbies?
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.920]   Now, I can bring this up briefly.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.120]   But I don't care about the Webbies because it's so mainstream focused.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.120]   It kind of bugs me.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.320]   It's like, well, yeah, it's all about the celebrities.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.200]   Yeah, geeks don't care about the Webbies.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.760]   Is the Webbies the one where you have to pay to submit your thing for an award or is that
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   another award?
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760]   Well, it's fresh.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.160]   You have to be, I think, nominated by the Academy of Web Sciences.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.880]   Seriously, there's some weird Academy thing that's on the budget.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.400]   And then you have to pay.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.480]   And then you have to, I think, pay.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.240]   That's just ridiculous.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240]   Okay.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.080]   So the reason the Webbies are well-known, I went to the Webbies once a few years ago.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.040]   The reason they're well-known is because of the five word thank yous.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.040]   Right.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.680]   Yeah, those are fun.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.960]   The winner speeches are short.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.080]   And the best one this year, I thought, oh, I don't care.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   Tech crunch.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.360]   Best $175 AOL ever spent.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360]   That's good.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.360]   That's funny.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.640]   Oh, I liked, I liked Dan Savage's.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   He said...
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.640]   This is...
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.040]   Tracy Morgan suck my...
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.040]   Oh.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.840]   No, I think it was can suck my because he had to do five, right?
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.840]   Okay.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.240]   I thought that was good.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240]   Nice.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.560]   Dan did win for It Gets Better.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.800]   And I think deservedly so on that.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.280]   We've talked about that before.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:48.840]   But hold sake, thanks to TechCrunch, Facebook's secret photo sharing app.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.840]   TechCrunch, did you see this?
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.840]   The Facebook said, oh, yeah, we have ways to turn features on and off.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.560]   In fact, everything in the next six months is already in our code.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.880]   And we just say who could see it.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.240]   But we have a kind of blanket.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.480]   TechCrunch can't see anything.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.480]   Really?
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.480]   Yes.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.720]   That was the thing they tested by turning on a special send pictures by fax feature just
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720]   for TechCrunch.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.200]   TechCrunch, did they do a story on it?
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.720]   Yes, it was just different than they said.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.720]   Why is this feature for sending things by fax?
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.720]   It's like the fact.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:26.680]   The gay and a rock blog turns out to be an American guy.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   At least we're talking about lesbian bloggers.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   Sort of.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.400]   But then that host of the lesbian fucking site that she was posting on Tenatsby, another
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.720]   American guy, that was this like a session.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.760]   Good lord.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.960]   Get your minds out of the gutter American guys.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.360]   It's like years away I can say that I like women without being a scary guy.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   It's just creepy.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.280]   Alright we're going to move on.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:55.440]   I think it's time to do our tip tool and actually Danny will do our number of the.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.440]   Oh no.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.440]   No you won't.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   Kevin will do it.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.080]   Danny, if you want, I will give you my tool.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   That sounded wrong.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   So very wrong.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   I'm not really excited.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:13.160]   But you know what I mean.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.800]   One homosexual to another.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   I'm not experimenting.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   It's fine.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.120]   Think yeah, he's open.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   Curious.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.800]   So if you have anything that you think would be an interesting tool for the Google folks,
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.560]   the twig folks, you come up with that in just a moment.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.720]   Your tool can pop up in a moment.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   But first.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.920]   We talked about this a little bit earlier.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.000]   So Google announced search by image and search by voice.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.880]   And those are going to be rolling out in the next couple of weeks.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:47.960]   But if you want to try them out now, you can go to Google.com/experimental.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.560]   And there's a voice search experiment, which you can join.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.880]   And then there's a search or instant on images, which is not search by image.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.880]   That's different.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.000]   Instant on images means that you get the Google instant drop down with suggestions as you
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   type.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   So you can join in either or you can't go involved.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   So that bugs me because I was plus one, right?
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.720]   So now I've left plus one.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.320]   So I'm going to do voice search.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320]   Right.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.840]   So if you opt in of the voice search experiment, you go to the Google search Google.com.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.840]   Search page and you'll have a little microphone on the search box.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.640]   If you want to give it a try before it's official.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   OK.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:23.800]   So now I click it.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.480]   Search for-- oh, no, I don't say search for stop.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.480]   Take two.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.160]   Gina Trappani.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160]   Nice.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   Jeanette Rapani.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   OK.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   That's-- OK.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   Nice.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   Don't make me laugh.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.160]   Seven marks.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.160]   Yay.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.720]   Hey, what?
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.680]   The guy from Search Engine Land.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   Jamie Sullivan.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   OK.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.680]   That was close.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.680]   The question is, does it work in my accent?
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.680]   Because that's always the problem.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.680]   Well, let me try it.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.360]   Let me try it.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.760]   I would like to know more about the Chromebook, please.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   Crown ladies golf.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   I think that's close.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   Crown ladies golf.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   There you go.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   These are going to have some more golf.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760]   Nice.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.160]   Have some more.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.760]   So that's a good tip.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   I'm going to leave that on.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   That's fun.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   Cool.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   That's very fun.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:32.440]   And now for our number of the week, Kevin Marks, filling in for Jeff Jarvis.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:38.760]   So the number I've got is a rather special one is 208 quadrillion quint-hour gintillion.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.480]   What the hell?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   Which is--
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   I've got a link for you to stick up.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.760]   I've got it right here.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.480]   So there was a bunch of discussion we had the weekend about gamification and canned games
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.760]   and play work in business.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.040]   And my colleague, JP Ranguswami, have a talk about that yesterday.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:04.280]   And then there was this wonderful slide set that Kathy Sierra recommended that talks this
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.280]   through in great detail.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:11.240]   And one of the points it makes is Google indexes 20 billion web pages, but the number of possible
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.600]   games of Go is so much larger.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   It's ridiculous.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:20.040]   And that's the difference between an actual game that creates a set of rules that you
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.480]   can explore for as long as you like, because you created something open-ended.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.840]   Or a game like Lego where you've got lots of little pieces you can plug together.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.920]   And some of these ideas of gamification which boil down to taking the crudest, simplest,
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.040]   high score table and attach that to your business.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.720]   So I think you want slide 27, which is where you can see the number.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.240]   What was the 28?
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.240]   I probably could just enter the slide number somewhere if we're well designed.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.240]   Oh, dear.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   I've clicked too many times.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.080]   I don't know where I'm going.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.080]   Doesn't even--
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.400]   This presentation is really worth a read.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.320]   If you've been thinking about games and gamification at all, this is like-- here's the Go stuff.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   This is so cool.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.920]   So that's the number of pages that Google searches.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:09.160]   And that's the number of possible games in Go, which is why computers can't play Go.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:18.200]   208 quadrillion, quintua gin two-gen, or 2.08 times 10 to the 130th possible games.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.160]   That's more than there are atoms in the universe.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.560]   Wow.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   Interesting.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.200]   So that's my number of the week, which is the favorite number.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.840]   We'll put a link to this slide share, too.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.480]   Or you can search SlideShare for Don't Play Games with the promised and put photos of
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   gameful design.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.840]   We have a link in the show notes as well.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.560]   That's really cool.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.200]   Good number and big.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.440]   That's the biggest number we've ever had.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   30.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.520]   Do you want to do a tool of the week for us, Danny?
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.720]   I've got to turn off turn table.fm.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.720]   Go on.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.760]   I'm still playing the game, listening to the music.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   Are you still there?
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Yes.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   No, I've got two tools.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   That's all right.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   Well, right.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   No, it's okay.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   One's mine, but I think you'll like it.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   Okay.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.080]   But I'll do first is Bitly Pro.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.800]   Well, it's now with Bitly.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.400]   They just announced today that they've made available a lot of the Bitly Pro features
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.480]   that either had to pay for you, couldn't get into.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:22.120]   And the primary thing is that if you're trying to shorten a URL, you can have your
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.440]   own custom URL.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:30.960]   So I can search and jenlandr.com.com and you've probably seen the New York Times as NYT
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.840]   dive and something like that.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.680]   So anybody can have those sorts of things.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.200]   And it's just a nice way, I think, both of keeping your own branding and also, for some
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.520]   reason you ever decided to migrate the short URLs that you yourself were putting out, you
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.280]   can always move that to another server.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.440]   You're kind of in control of your own domain.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.920]   So now I just go to my settings.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.560]   I say add a custom short domain.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   And you're so--
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:58.160]   You got to get one, but once you've got one.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.800]   Oh, I have to have it.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:06.840]   Yeah, they recommend that you go try a couple of those short URL search engines to suggest
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.760]   one based on your current one.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   If you were Google, would have already gotten one for you before you would be.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   It should, yes.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   Or you want Leo.im, of course, you've got it.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   You'd have been there.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.080]   The other thing was something we put out about two weeks ago, it's called the periodic table
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.040]   of SEO.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.440]   And the reason I suggested to the audience is just that there's a lot of misunderstanding
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.360]   about what SEO is or the ways that Google wants you to do stuff or being wants you to
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360]   do stuff.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.400]   And so we put together this thing to try to explain.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.840]   These are the most important things you really need to think about, not make it overwhelming
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.480]   for people and try to have people focusing things like on CQ, which stands for quality
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.600]   or CR, which is doing your key read research.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:50.640]   And so I'd really suggest that if you know someone who's trying to get up to speed or
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:54.360]   if you're a developer who's trying to understand this and you feel like it can be overwhelming
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.360]   or that there is just too much garbage out there, you think SEO is just, oh, don't you
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.840]   have to spam a bunch of blogs?
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.360]   No, don't.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.600]   That's what it's designed to help you do.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.640]   And there's a whole online guide to tell you more about each of those different factors
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   that are out there.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.080]   Danny, I could promise you that because we get a lot of questions on the radio show from
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.680]   people who have been approached by SEO snake oil salesmen.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.480]   I'm always saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.720]   I will now tell them, go here, read this, you're done.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.640]   Don't pay any money to those guys.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.120]   I hope that it's helpful and yes, in general, if everybody, you ever get a cold call email
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.480]   in your inbox, you can safely delete that.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.120]   There's not going to be any surprises for you in there.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   Yay.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120]   Great stuff.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.120]   Thank you, Danny.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.760]   Danny Sullivan is at SearchEngineLand.com.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:44.600]   That's where you'll find the periodic table of SEO, among other things, searchengineland.com.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.480]   Really great to have you.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   Thank you so much for having us.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   Thanks for being here.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   You're really not here.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:55.000]   Also joining us, Kevin Marks from Shatter.com and salesforce.com.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.160]   Always a pleasure having you on one of the best observers of this stuff there is.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.920]   The guy who knows, so it's always good to talk to you.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.920]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.920]   Thanks very much.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.920]   I appreciate your being here.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]   We appreciate it.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   Joining in.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.920]   It's also nice to see some outside.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.920]   Everyone's in the wild.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.720]   Kevin is in this garden.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.120]   One once in a while is to see a tree, a leaf, a shrub, so pleasant.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.800]   That's about as close as I'm going to get today.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.800]   And of course, Gina Trapani.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.240]   We always love Gina.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.240]   She's the best.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.800]   It was so fun to have some time with Gina.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.720]   She's a smarter word.org.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.800]   Get some time with her there at Gina Trapani or Trapani on, I guess you're spelled the
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.720]   same on Twitter either way.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   Yep.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720]   And of course-- Great to be here.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   Great show today.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   Miss Jeff, but awesome show.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720]   Thanks for coming on.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.720]   I didn't mention at the beginning.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.040]   Jeff's just out of town, right?
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040]   Where did he go?
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.680]   I forget now where he's at, but he's somewhere he couldn't call in, which is somewhere must
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:52.920]   be very remote, because normally as we all know, Jeff is able to Skype in Brace basically
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.920]   from everywhere.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.120]   Yeah, he's called us from all around the world, so it must be somewhere like, I don't
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.120]   know.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120]   It must be the middle of the night somewhere where Jeff is.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.120]   Maybe that's it, yeah.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.120]   We'll definitely back next week.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.280]   We do miss him.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.000]   But thank you all for being here.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.320]   We do this show every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.960]   Actually, we try to do it one, because we move it up.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.440]   This is the one show we try to get on time.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440]   1 p.m.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440]   Pacific 4 p.m.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440]   Eastern.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   That's 2,000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   But you know what?
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.840]   You don't have to be here.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.840]   You can always download the show after the fact.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:29.120]   Twit.tv/twig or just anywhere finer podcasts are offered up.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.680]   And episode 100 next week.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680]   Well, awesome.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.160]   Something special to celebrate.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.280]   Maybe we'll buy a Twit brick.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.280]   Took.tv.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.800]   I've got some bricks behind me on the shelf here.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.560]   These are great bricks.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:47.080]   We are selling them to raise money for the new studio, which I believe we will be doing
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.720]   this show from in about a month.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.720]   Awesome.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.720]   That's me really.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.000]   Did I take you by to see it, Gina?
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.640]   We drove by, but then I had to run and get my flight, so I haven't gotten a tour yet.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]   But that's good.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   I have a reason to come back.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   You'll see it when it's done.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.600]   You've got to see the old cottage, which is the bit that's going away.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.520]   Gina was here and Kevin have both seen that.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.720]   Thank goodness.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.400]   And so now we can tear it down.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.560]   Yes, you now have my blessings and move forward.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.360]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:32.640]   And we'll see you next week on Twig.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   And Kevin Marks is still here.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.640]   He doesn't want to ever leave.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.640]   Oh, sorry.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:39.480]   I was reading the chat room.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.560]   You can continue to read the chat room.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.440]   They're great fun.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.960]   Stay as long as you like.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.320]   Actually, I'm going back to turntable.fm.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320]   That was cool.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   I mean, hang up when you go back to that because I'm pretty awesome.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.840]   Yeah, pretty awesome.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.840]   What a great tip.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:59.960]   I'm sure somewhere they set his curtain for me.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.600]   Apparently all mallec just emailed us saying, "I want to tell Leo about turntable.fm."
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   Too late.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.080]   He's got his own room.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   Does he?
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.080]   He's got a key to his career.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.480]   This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.280]   I am so excited about this.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.280]   What a great idea.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.320]   We've got to have a twit room.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.960]   It's the same sort of thing that Pandora plays on, except that instead of using all
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.160]   these people to do music DNA, it's a bunch of people you know or their friends.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.160]   Right.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.720]   So the guy who is the complete music nurse is on the stage and the rest of you just hang
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:32.720]   out and chat.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:33.720]   Oh, you know what?
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.720]   I think we killed him.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.360]   I bet you did.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.360]   Yeah, could not connect.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.360]   Please try again.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.800]   If you still cannot connect, you may have your firewall blocking your connection.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800]   No.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:43.800]   I think it's broken.
