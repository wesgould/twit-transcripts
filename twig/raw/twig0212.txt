[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.700]   Gina Trapani is back.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700]   Welcome back, Gina. We missed you last week.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700]   Hello, missed you guys.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700]   We had a great panel. I was sad to miss it.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.700]   But it's very happy to be back.
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700]   We installed the internet last week.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700]   That was exciting.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700]   You should everybody have to do that.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700]   Yeah, this one week.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700]   One week you missed a lot.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.700]   I don't know if that internet step was worth the time.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700]   That's Danny Sullivan.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700]   Search engine land fame.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.700]   Hey, Danny.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700]   Hey.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700]   You should know when did you start Search engine land?
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700]   Oh, well, I started the site end of 2007.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700]   Okay.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700]   And then the previous site dated back to '95, middle of '95.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   '95?
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.700]   What was the original site about?
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.700]   Was it about Altavista?
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700]   Altavista.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700]   The original site was called a webmaster's guide to search engines,
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.700]   because I wrote it to try to explain to webmasters how search engines interact with their websites.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   Brilliant.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   Pre-Google.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   There.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.700]   Pre-Google.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700]   It was all...
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700]   It was...
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   It was all Magellan.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700]   Magellan.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   I remember that.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   It was all when Yahoo was big and everybody thought Yahoo was the big thing that needed to be worried about.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   And Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700]   How's your shoulder, Jeff?
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   You fell down the stairs?
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   That's horrible.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   That's horrible.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   No, but I'm glad you're all right.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   I'm fine.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   I'm just in pain.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.700]   Well, you won't be playing Wimbledon next year, but that's okay.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   No.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700]   No.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   Well, good.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.700]   I'm glad to have you all here.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.700]   Actually, Danny told us just as we were starting the show, breaking news.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.700]   Yahoo!
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   For the first time in five years, number one on the net.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   Is that right?
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   It's crazy.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   It's crazy.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   It's crazy.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.420]   You know, every year comp score comes out when they say these are the top sites or the
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.380]   top networks in the United States.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.220]   And every year the list is always the same.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.420]   There's hardly ever any changes that kind of go on with it.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.460]   But this month it came out and that turns out in July that Yahoo popped above Google
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.180]   to be the number one site network in the United States since the first time since at least
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.980]   early 2008 since they've been there.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.380]   God, that's amazing.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.540]   196 million unique users to Google's 192 million unique users.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.100]   And that's not even counting Tumblr.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.660]   A comp score has an integrated all the Tumblr numbers.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.660]   So those are separate.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.020]   And if you put those in there as well, then that would take Yahoo!
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.820]   Up to like about 235,000 years, a big, big, big gap between them and Google at that point.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.620]   It's always been back and forth though.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.620]   Yahoo!
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.620]   Yahoo!
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.620]   Yahoo!
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.500]   It's been like number two for a really long time.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.820]   So the other truth is people don't go to Google for Google.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.540]   Google doesn't emphasize having Google.com as a major site.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.100]   It's maps and other things.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.100]   Yahoo!
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.180]   has been a content site for a destination site since the beginning of a portal.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.820]   Well a portal turned destination site.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.580]   They're about content, aren't they?
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.580]   Really?
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.580]   Yes.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.580]   So what does that include?
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.540]   So would Gmail be a Google site?
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540]   Would Yahoo!
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.660]   That should include any Google property and any Yahoo!
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   property.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.900]   It doesn't matter that it's on Google.com versus YouTube.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.060]   Like YouTube isn't broken out from the Google number.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060]   YouTube isn't broken out.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060]   Well that's content.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.060]   If you want.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.660]   In like a day or two, Google will probably say, "Well you know if you factored in this
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.700]   thing over here, that thing over there."
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.420]   And so it'll be interesting to see.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.940]   Because Google really doesn't like it.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.380]   What about mobile Danny?
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.500]   With people that supposedly mobile, everything I'm seeing with the sites I work with.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.180]   Mobile's going nuts in the numbers.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.180]   Is Yahoo!
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.180]   or anything in particular?
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.980]   They have a new weather app, everybody was talking about.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.700]   Is mobile a factor in this?
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.700]   I don't know.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.620]   In fact we're still trying to figure out what it is that might have popped it up.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620]   The first thought was, "Well maybe this is all the Tumblr numbers that have come in."
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.620]   But like I said, Tumblr's broken out on its own.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.300]   So the gap has always been very close.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.260]   But something happened that maybe moved Yahoo!
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.100]   And it may be also that what happens in the summer is that you get the people who aren't
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.300]   searching on Google as much.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   The students go back to school or are out of school and everything.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.900]   So it could be that they were so close and Yahoo! has had just enough of a gain that
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.820]   Google's chint them off of a drop might have had an impact.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820]   So yeah.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.820]   Good on Marissa Mayer, that's huge.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.620]   I sure there'll be some celebrations over at Yahoo!
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.620]   You bet.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.180]   And she looks damn fine in a gown.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   Can you believe all the attention?
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.180]   Let me ask Gina.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.180]   She's a woman.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.100]   Can you believe all the attention?
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.300]   I feel kind of bad.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.860]   So Vogue did an article on Marissa Mayer.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.860]   It's Vogue.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.660]   Marissa Mayer's always loved fashion.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.300]   We know that.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.380]   That doesn't make her less of a brilliant person or an engineer or a CEO.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   They did a, I think, a great-looking picture of her in a designer dress with fabulous
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.260]   heels upside down.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.860]   And people say, "Oh, it overshadows the story."
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.660]   And I don't think so.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.260]   Can we live in a world where somebody can be interested in fashion and still be brilliant?
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.260]   Yes.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.260]   We can't.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.060]   I do think that a too much is made of her looks, but it's kind of like, it's a unicorn
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.060]   thing.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.820]   It's like, you're just not used to seeing young, female, CEOs, like in the position that she's
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.820]   in.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.980]   And, you know, look, I think, I think Mayer has a lot of control and a lot of say in the
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.260]   way that she's presented in the media.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.260]   Oh, yes.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.860]   She accepts these interviews and photo shoots and does so full well knowing what they're
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860]   going to turn out to be.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.660]   And I think that she probably- She thought it was a good idea.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.660]   She thought it was a good idea.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.180]   I wouldn't be surprised if she had final say on what photographs they finally publish.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.660]   And I feel like if she's comfortable with that presentation, then that's cool.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.140]   But I do think that a lot is made of her appearance, but I think it's human nature to
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.980]   react to something that looks different.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.940]   It is kind of like the unicorn principle.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.940]   And I think if you read the article, what is very impressive and, by the way, look at
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.980]   the other pictures, what is very impressive is that she held her own in a boys club, you
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.980]   know?
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.980]   Actually, this is CEO's go wild.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   This is the wrong slide show.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:29.420]   Although, did they make a lot about Richard Branson dressed as in drag as a stewardess?
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   I don't know.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.140]   Was that a big story?
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.380]   Larry Allison drinking the largest bottle of champagne I've ever seen?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   It's interesting.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.260]   I read the Vogue article on Think on Friday, and the link I had-
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.860]   That's not a phrase I ever thought I'd hear on this show.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.180]   I read the Vogue article.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.140]   You buy it for the articles, yes.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.260]   But it's funny because I read so much on the Internet.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.420]   I don't tend to think of this publication, that public.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.620]   I mean, I know Vogue and everything, right?
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.940]   But I clicked on the link and I read the article and it was only the article.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.140]   There was no pictures or anything.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.780]   So I actually had this weird experience where I went in.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.340]   I read the article critically.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.340]   That's it, right?
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.900]   So I read the article critically and I'm actually going through the article, hmm, is that right
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.900]   there?
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.900]   What do I think about this?
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.900]   What did that?
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.900]   And I thought overall it was a good piece or whatever.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.900]   I didn't see the couch thing at all until yesterday, which, by the way, I recreated on
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.100]   Twitter myself because I have that couch.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.100]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.500]   Ah, not exactly, but I have a couch with that kind of thing.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:37.460]   So it's a few tweets back I did yesterday and that is a really hard pose to hold.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.260]   So it's just Rupert Murdoch.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.660]   I don't know how much you did it because, yeah.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.860]   You know, Danny, they have trained professional photographers, lighting technicians, makeup
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.300]   artists.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.220]   You can't duplicate that at home.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.220]   And that's it.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.820]   Let me tell you, my wife's like, no, you got to hold the eye this way.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.580]   And I'm like, oh, so, you know, first of all, I thought it was a great picture and it went
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.580]   with a great article.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.580]   And you know, who cares?
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.140]   We just want to pose it whenever it's both.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.620]   So who said this?
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.700]   Danny Sullivan Marissa Meyer.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.020]   I really like even numbers and I like heavily divisible numbers.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.460]   Twelve is my lucky number.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.380]   I just love how divisible it is.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.660]   I don't like odd numbers and I really don't like primes.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.460]   When I turned 37, I put on a strong face, but I was not looking forward to 37, but 37 turned
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.460]   out to be a pretty amazing year, especially considering that 36 is divisible by 12.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.980]   Wow.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.260]   That's the lead in the Vogue piece.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.260]   Wow.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.700]   She may have regretted that particular quote.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.820]   Shower, we're getting anything today, man.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.780]   She knows her.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.780]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.380]   She is Coco Chanel for our day.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.940]   No, I think it's I bet you it's intentional that Marissa Meyer is saying just as she had
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.300]   her baby and took the job at CEO that you can have everything and that women shouldn't
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:11.780]   be kept out of the boardroom or out of the fashion week.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   You can have it all.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.940]   And I'm wearing heels from now on.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.260]   I love you saw women in leadership positions.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260]   I think that there are women who play it kind of like one of the guys and I think there
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.020]   are women who are like love, like being sort of conventional, like have conventional female
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.300]   interests, you know, fashion, whatever.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.740]   I think it's great that she is, you know, that that she is being who she is.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.260]   She's one representation of one way that you can be a woman in a leadership position.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.260]   Exactly.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260]   I'm not into fashion, but rock on.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260]   Rock on.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.260]   That's what I say.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.700]   It's a, it's a, I think postmodern feminism, I hope.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.460]   And I think, you know, role models for women in both technology and corporate leadership
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.140]   is important.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.500]   And, and, you know, however you, what was the story we quoted about a month ago of the
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.580]   woman who's high up in Google who dressed like a geek, right?
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.020]   She finally decided enough, right?
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   Perfect.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   Yes.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.020]   And, and I salute that, right?
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.020]   You can be yourself.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.020]   You can be in technology.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.780]   You can be in leadership and you can also be yourself, whatever that is.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.260]   And I just want everyone to know, I don't like sports.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.300]   I don't drink beer and I don't like cars.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.300]   So there.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   Because you're a queen.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.500]   We just, we just have to eat.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.180]   I would love some blue suede pumps.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.180]   Let's take a look.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.620]   Anyway, congratulations.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.060]   I think you could pretty clearly point to Marissa Meyer and say that the strategy is
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.860]   working at Yahoo with these numbers.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.860]   I really think.
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.020]   Yeah, that's, that's the numbers are incredible.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.860]   It's a heart, a little heart for me to believe that I just don't spend a lot of time at
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.420]   Yahoo, but I don't think that, and I don't think any of us do, but I don't think they
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.060]   were representative of real people.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.060]   Do yes.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.060]   Real people do.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.060]   Yep.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.060]   I use liquor.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.060]   I like it.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.060]   I flicker pretty often.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.060]   So I'm on one of those numbers.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   Yep.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.060]   It's good.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.060]   All right.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.060]   Well, that's fair.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.060]   All right.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   Let's, let's play some drums.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.500]   Let's play some trumpets because ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.060]   The Google change log.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.580]   David Trapani has the latest new stuff at Google.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.580]   YouTube for Android got a major update, a really nice kind of redesign in that card
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.140]   design that we're going to use to with Google now and some of the more modern apps.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.300]   The big feature that the YouTube update for Android got was this picture in picture feature
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.900]   where you can watch a video and you can minimize it to the, to the bottom of that bottom corner
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.620]   of the screen and continue searching for other videos while that video is still playing.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.620]   Really cool.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.620]   I'm not kind of multitasking.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.620]   I would have been really excited about that feature if the video played over any app, but
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.620]   it only works inside the YouTube app.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.220]   So so there you go.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.540]   But definitely worth taking a look at really nice redesign there.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.100]   Google plus for Android also got a big update.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.460]   First the messenger app that used to be in your app drawer alongside with Hangouts.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.460]   That's gone.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.340]   So it's just Hangouts now, which was, so we're seeing that unification continuing toward that
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.860]   unification in Hangouts, but there's a new app in your app drawer, app drawer called G plus
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.960]   photos.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.820]   If you tap on that, it will bring you directly to your photos on Google plus that the ones
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.420]   that are getting kind of the awesome treatment, the ones that Google's automatic automatically
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:31.020]   picking out highlights and creating, creating the, you know, like, it's a word I'm looking
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.660]   for the collages of best photos.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.580]   Also Google draw Google plus for Android added drive integration.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:44.260]   So when you get the update, when you launch the app, it will prompt you and say, do you
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.980]   want to add all your photos and videos from drive into Google plus automatically?
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.700]   If you opt in and say yes, then all photos that are in drive will also get the same treatment,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.540]   the same kind of awesome treatment that your Google plus photos get as well.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.860]   So they'll get highlighted and auto awesome as well.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860]   Let's see.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.500]   Oh, and other Google plus news on the desktop, Google has added native translations to Google
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   plus.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.780]   So if you post them in Google plus and then someone posts a comment, which is not in your
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.700]   native language, there will be a little translate link right there.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.220]   So you click on the translate link and it'll automatically translate it into your game.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220]   It's great.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   It really works well.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220]   It's everywhere.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   They've kind of took it away for a while and it's back and I'm delighted.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.060]   Yeah, it looks, it looks really nice.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.340]   It's nice enough to add another extension.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.780]   That's just the desktop right now, but it's going to come to the mobile app soon, soon
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.780]   as well.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.460]   We were talking about this before the show, Google added a little reminder feature to
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.740]   Google Keep, which is the Android app that is a little reminder note taking app.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.340]   So if you added note into Keep now, you can add a reminder to that note that is location
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.660]   specific.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.620]   So yeah, this is cool.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.300]   So for example, if you create a note that's your grocery list, you can say you can set
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:04.220]   a reminder to for that note to alert you when you walk into your grocery store, or you can
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.300]   say by time as well, you can add a note that's, you know, take out the garbage and have it
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:15.340]   notify you Google Now styles, like say on Thursday night when your garbage is going out.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.780]   To use the new reminder feature, you just tap on the Remind Me button at the bottom of
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.860]   any note and you choose a type reminder for a time-based or location.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.660]   And I presume it works with Google Now.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.700]   You can, you know, in Google Now, you could say Remind Me 2.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.940]   I wonder if you can add a location tag, like Remind Me 2 Buy Eggs at Petaloma Market and
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.940]   it would know that.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.940]   Right.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   Yeah, I'll have to try it.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.420]   I don't think it's, I don't think it's doing that yet.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.220]   I think you can do Remind Me 2 and it'll enter the note, but then I think you still have
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.340]   to go into the note and to add the location tags.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.340]   But that would be really cool.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.260]   And it doesn't seem to be that.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.500]   It looks like it is.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.740]   It looks like it is because this isn't, I just dictated that to Now.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.180]   Remind Me to Buy Eggs at Petaloma Market got Petaloma Market address.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.060]   It says, set reminder.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.900]   I think it does in fact add location data to that, which is, yeah, no kidding.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.900]   That's amazing.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.220]   Yeah, we'll find out.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.220]   I'll go to the market.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.140]   If it reminds me to buy eggs, I'll know.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.140]   That's really useful.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.860]   Actually, I think I want to say iPhones done that it does.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.060]   I believe do that, but that's a nice feature.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.900]   Yeah, series reminder on.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.820]   Yeah, I believe Siri does do that.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.140]   And finally, Google Maps and Waze are starting to swap data in Google Maps.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.660]   If there's been an incident reported through the Waze app, which Google recently required,
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.420]   I guess it was three months ago.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.180]   You will see a little card that says incident happened here.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.180]   And there's a line that says reported via the Waze app, which Chad's got up on screen
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.180]   right now.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.300]   And likewise, Waze users are now seeing Google Street View images inside of Waze, which
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.140]   makes it easier for them to verify and report them for incident.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:59.900]   So really nice to see Google and Waze swapping data, making use of each other instead of
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.780]   shutting one down or one cannibalizing features from the other.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.820]   It's just really nice to see them folding in data from both products into the other.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.420]   How long is it going to take for the antitrust investigation to be done there?
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.620]   Because they haven't bought them yet.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.620]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   Oh, that is amazing.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.260]   So they bought them, but it hasn't been approved.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.940]   No, it hasn't.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.260]   So this is just merely data sharing.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   And I wonder if they'll be tighter relationship once they do acquire it.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.340]   In other words, maybe they'll even eliminate Waze and just put that capability into the
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.340]   match.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.340]   Right.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.340]   Right.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.180]   So the ability to report for maps.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   Right.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.820]   That's a good question, Jeff.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.220]   I don't know.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.740]   Good one.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.620]   That's all I got today for the change log.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.620]   That's the change log.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.740]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:57.900]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to for our weekly bitch fest.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.900]   And we have two bitches today.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.020]   You're such a bitch.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.620]   Jeff Jarvis and Danny Sullivan, both a little perturbed about the Moto X. What's the deal?
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.620]   Danny, you want to start?
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.620]   Then I'll take them off.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:22.300]   Well, so wind him up Danny and then we'll let him go.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.700]   You know, so I don't have one of the review units, but I want to see how it works.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.500]   Just got all this Google now integration that apparently is there and you can speak through
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   whatever.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   So I'm going, wow, this is a serious search stuff or whatever.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.980]   So I better get out there and order one.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.540]   So I go to order it.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.020]   And the first thing I wanted to do and just buy it just plain.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.460]   I don't want to con.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.460]   I don't need a contract.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.300]   I've got like three different lines with AT&T.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.220]   Like I need another line with it.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.260]   I already wrote a phone's in on it.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.300]   So I'm reading up and it's like, so first of all, the full price one is like $700 and
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   I'm still kind of staggered.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.340]   Like, why is this $700 on the Nexus 4 is like 300?
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.340]   But okay, you know, it's a work thing, whatever, suck it up.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.340]   I just don't want the contract.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:11.740]   And then it's like, even if you buy it off contract with AT&T, it's still sim locked.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:18.060]   And it's like, this is this revolutionary phone that I can have in wood with this thing
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.740]   that unlocks it and all this other stuff or whatever and you're still only going to sell
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.660]   it to me with the sim lock or whatever.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.260]   So I was kind of like blown away by that.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.100]   I was really annoyed now.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   I feel paralyzed.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.100]   I'm going to get you.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.100]   I know you're coming.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.580]   I'm feeling like paralyzed because I'm like, well, why is there not a developer edition
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.540]   that I can at least get out now?
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:42.140]   Or you know, why can't I just buy it direct and have it unlocked with sim or whatever?
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.540]   Why can't I buy it directly from Motorola?
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.700]   What the hell is wrong?
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.540]   And then after I post this out on Google+, people start going, oh yeah.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.820]   And you should see what Jeff has to say.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.220]   Same complaint, Jeff, or what?
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.220]   Well, no.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.220]   Now here's what I did.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:07.700]   So I signed up so that I could win the gold ticket to go spend $700, $674 to be exact on
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   the phone.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.100]   And I got to order early.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.980]   So 9 a.m. on Monday, I could go into the Moto Maker and make my phone.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.140]   Like Danny, I didn't necessarily care about the color, but OK, navy blue with a nice little
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140]   silver accent.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.420]   I was looking at it.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.500]   So I go ahead and go through the whole thing.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.580]   You're either AT&T customer, not an AT customer, or one I got by an off contract, off contract.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.860]   Click on that, because what it says, asterisk to your contract.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.780]   I'm saying this is nuts.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.780]   Come on.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.780]   And so I let it go for a few minutes, because I'm thinking Jeff, you do this every time you
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.500]   order something, then you get buyers or more.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.340]   And then you go through this whole thing and they're going to make fun of you on twig.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.780]   But it said to your contract.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.980]   So I don't want to get stuck with that.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.260]   I want to deal with all this stuff.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.700]   So I call Motorola.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.100]   Hold, hold, hold, hold.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.900]   Like any old telephone company, I wait on hold for 20 minutes.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.220]   Don't they know how to answer the phone?
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:08.860]   And well, the nice guy with the whatever accent says, I'm going to escalate this.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.700]   I got to point out, you're not buying it.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.700]   It's not available for normal people yet.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.540]   No, this was not a, this was not a twig special guy.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.780]   This was, hey, if you'd like a chance on Google plus, I signed up.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.780]   Right.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.620]   But this is a prompt.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.820]   This is still, I mean, you can't just want people to know you can't go and buy it now.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.820]   You can't go by now.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.820]   No, no.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.340]   And it may be that when you get Motorola support, they have no idea what this is.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.940]   Well, no, they made a whole point.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.660]   Are you calling about the Moto X?
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.660]   Press one.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.660]   Right.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.660]   Right.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.660]   This is Moto X support.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.660]   This is the person devoted to Moto X.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.620]   So it pulls up my account, pulls up everything.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.620]   So they escalate it.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.820]   You're going to hear back.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.820]   Okay, fine.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   That's step one.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.180]   Step two, I'm thinking, I'm going to get this thing.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.180]   What's going to be?
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.180]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.500]   So meanwhile, I go on a Twitter, of course, you know, bitch fast.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.980]   And AT&T comes back and says, oh, can we help you?
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.700]   I'll thank you very much, very nice.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.540]   They haven't called back.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.980]   They're either.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:18.580]   So then I look at the terms of sale, which I snapshot it and put up online.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.020]   You might want to go to the terms of sale, or you can go to my Twitter feed or my Google
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.260]   plus feed chat and find this.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.980]   It says that you mean you are not a, you're verifying, you're not a store.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.980]   Okay, cool there.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.900]   And then it says you may not resell the phone.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.540]   And we're really serious about this says Google.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.140]   Well, I can't resell it.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.140]   I bought it.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.140]   You can of course resell.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.140]   There's the first sale.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.140]   I know.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.140]   Right.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.540]   But I think what they're trying to do is discourage scalping.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:51.340]   But remember, this may not be what you see on the site when it's open to the public.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.540]   You have it, you have early access.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.820]   Well, but I have early access as a member of the public, not as a geek guy.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.620]   No, but you understand that what they don't want is scalpers who have early access to
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.460]   get in there and buy a bunch of them and sell them on eBay.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.660]   This may change, I don't know if it will, but it might change.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.660]   I don't know.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.900]   You're not talking about a normal experience at this point.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.900]   You don't know what it is.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.100]   Well, that's because I'm involved and it's not normal.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.500]   You're doing, well, this is why, by the way, I just want to say I never, ever do these
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.300]   kinds of press promotions.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.500]   You wait till it's for sale for sale.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.500]   You're not listening to me.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.500]   It's not a press.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   No, I know.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   It's quote open to the public.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   It's early adopters.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.420]   This is there, but it is not really open to the public.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.660]   But it was anybody can sign up for it.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.380]   Now they may have looked at me and said, Oh, he's on twig.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.380]   Yes.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.140]   But no, no, no, no, but if you go to, if you go to AT&T, it says send me an email when
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.140]   it's available.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.140]   It's not available yet.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.540]   Well, actually, this is, I mean, this is the thing that gets me wrapped up too.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.700]   I left on vacation today.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.020]   All this stuff happened on the first, right?
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.460]   So I've gone for two weeks.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.460]   Kind of come back.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.820]   Now I'm catching up.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:59.020]   And so the first thing I go to is this site called Google and I type in Moto X, right?
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.540]   Because it finds some information about it.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.460]   And I get to the Moto X site and I'm looking at it now and it's not very clear about when
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.740]   it's coming out, what's happening, how do I get it, what are the options?
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.420]   I mean, I got all these glossy colors and design.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.700]   If I did the notify me thing, which I'm pretty sure I did when it first came out and I never
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.740]   got notified and never gotten to that.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.740]   It's not out yet, guys.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.260]   But I don't know if it's not out to the 23rd.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   It's fine.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.460]   You say it's fine that it's available on the 23rd.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.020]   You scroll down, you get down here, you keep going and it's like, it's going to be, oh,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.420]   the available is fucking through.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   I don't understand guys.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.020]   This is what happens whenever there's a new phone.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.620]   What should happen that way?
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.900]   You know what, but this is what irritates me the most.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.980]   It shouldn't happen that way and it shouldn't happen that way from Google.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   From Google.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   But that's the point.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.980]   I agree with you.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   The Motorola is not Google.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.940]   They want to make it sound like they're Google, but they're still really old school
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.940]   in a lot of ways.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.020]   And this is like an old school carrier, an old school handset maker acting like an old
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.020]   school handset.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.940]   I would wait till Friday before you start bitching about this, to be honest with you.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.940]   I will see.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.940]   Well, I don't, but you know, on Friday it's not like I'm going to fix these things.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.940]   I'm not going to fight in.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.460]   Yes, because that's when the mass public buys the damn thing.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.860]   No, no, no, you're still like this was a public thing.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.780]   It was a public motion.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   And just like you, I feel like I was getting used by Motorola.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.700]   It was an early adopter promotion.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.580]   And maybe they weren't clear, but what you're doing is you're buying it from 18.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.020]   It was an open post on Google plus to the world.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.100]   It was, I followed it on Google plus.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.940]   You follow Moto X or do you follow?
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   I follow Motorola.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.100]   So here's what they didn't do right, which is make it very clear that if you want to buy
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:51.900]   it, you have to buy it from AT&T that they're not selling it without AT&T at this point.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.300]   You're buying an AT&T phone.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.060]   Well, I know that, but not with a two year contract when you pay $674.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.260]   That's how it works.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.340]   No, no, it's off contract on contract.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.500]   How could you be an off contract phone on contract?
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   Okay, obviously you've not bought a lot of phones.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.980]   Jeff, so here's the deal.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.660]   If you're due for an upgrade, it's 200 bucks.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.900]   Are you due for an upgrade?
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.260]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.260]   That was an option.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   I did not do that option.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.420]   I chose when the specific option was off contract.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.220]   That means you pay the full price.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.700]   Fine.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.460]   And all of the carriers, no, but all, you know, I understand, but all the carriers do
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.820]   this that extends your contract.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.900]   That's how it works, Jeff.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.900]   No.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.660]   It sucks, but that's how carriers do it.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.500]   That's why mobile phones are the most hated.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.020]   No, I've taken phones to AT&T and said, put a sim in this, there's no contract.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   Put a sim in this.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.780]   It's different from buying it from AT&T.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.220]   Do you have any choice of buying it from anybody other than...
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.220]   That's right.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.740]   And so what you could say is why didn't Google offer a Google edition first?
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.620]   But I can tell you why.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.220]   Same reason they didn't offer a customization for Verizon.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.140]   They have promotional deals with the companies.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:10.340]   You contrast it with when I want to go buy the next iPhone, I can buy the full iPhone
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.660]   from AT&T and it's not going to be locked.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.340]   No, it's not going to be locked if you get it from Apple.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.860]   It's locked if you get it from AT&T.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.660]   Yeah, but if I pay full price for it.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.660]   No.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.340]   There's no magic full price.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:31.100]   The full price is what you pay unless you are due for an upgrade on your phone.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   No, no, no.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.100]   I could have gotten $200 deal.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   I'm due.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   The choice was off contract.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.740]   Yeah, the choice was off contract.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.300]   Because you're buying it through AT&T.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.900]   What you think you're buying is like the Nexus 4, but it's not.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   Why...
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.900]   We're not keen to keep it.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.900]   And that...
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   Because you're buying it from AT&T, not Motorola.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.940]   But it says take away from it.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.940]   Contract.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.660]   My record, you're cheating.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.740]   They're coming out with this, "Hey, this is this new phone.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.020]   This is this new way.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.300]   This is a new revolution.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.740]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.660]   And it's all blah.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.660]   It's all same old, same old.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.660]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.660]   I mean...
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.180]   What was revolutionary was actually the Nexus 4.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.500]   I've really come to appreciate that phone because...
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.620]   Which I'm going to hold on a lot.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.860]   Yeah, you know, there's no LTE, whatever.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.340]   And I look at it and I think, "Wow, a $300 smartphone that's not locked, that you can buy
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.340]   direct."
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.500]   And yeah, so you're only going to go between AT&T and T-Mobile, whatever, but still, and
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.900]   the rest of the world.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.300]   So, yeah, I understand the confusion here.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.020]   If you buy a phone from Google, like the Nexus 4, that is not locked to a carrier, it's
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.420]   not a carrier phone, there's of course no extension of your contract.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.220]   It's truly off-contract because it's off-carrier.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.900]   But if you buy a phone from AT&T, even if you pay the full price, it's under contract.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.740]   You cannot call it an off-contract phone and put me on a contract.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.580]   That might have been an error in nomenclature because it's confusing.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.100]   No, the error is the error.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.860]   Off-contract is the proper thing.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.140]   So long-term the story is, I just said to heck with this, I'm getting a bad taste in
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.460]   my mouth and I don't want to get stuck having it going through eight layers of Dante's hell
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   with AT&T.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.940]   The issue really would be, am I going to get a phone that has AT&T on logo on the back
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.940]   or not?
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.500]   Currently, currently you're going to get a phone with a carrier logo.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.540]   If it's Friday, it'll be AT&T.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.500]   If it's the following week, it could be Verizon or AT&T.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.660]   But that's what you're getting.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.220]   I didn't get the end of the story.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.820]   But I decide I'm not going to risk all this.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.340]   So I'm just going to cancel this thing and then I'll go to the store and get a black
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.180]   one and who cares, right?
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.380]   So then I see the email that came afterwards, "Oh, you have to cancel within an hour."
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.740]   Well, it didn't give me the answer within an hour.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.980]   So I go another half hour on hold and then that cuts me nowhere.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   And then finally I got an email from an ISCOT.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.140]   Nice Glen.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.060]   And Glen does say, "No, it shouldn't say on contract."
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.980]   Yeah, because that's confusing.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.260]   The carriers understand what that means.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.620]   It's like unlimited bandwidth, Jeff.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.180]   You're not listening.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.340]   It should say off contract.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.580]   It should not have the asterisk that says on and to your contract.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.980]   That was a mistake.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.300]   So there is no two-year contract extension if you buy it.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   Yes.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   Oh, good.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   That's what the guy told me.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.300]   I had to go through all this, right?
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.540]   So now I don't know if I'm getting it or not getting it or whatever.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   But I agree with Danny.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.660]   What it really made me do again was appreciate my Nexus 4 and say, "You know what?
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.900]   Yeah, I say I want LTE.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.500]   But do I really notice the difference on my phone?
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.420]   I use that more on my machine and other things.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.620]   This is a great thing.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.380]   I think that I should be loyal and wait for the Nexus 5 if there is one."
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.460]   And that rumors are that there may be one.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.460]   In October.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.460]   This fall, yeah.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.460]   That was...
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.460]   There were my Google+ commenters when I said, "I don't know.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.980]   Last but usual indecisive that I am.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.980]   What should I do?"
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.140]   And they almost all said Nexus 5.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.140]   Wait, wait for the Nexus 5.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.180]   And I didn't listen to them because I had gadget addiction and I went and did it.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.380]   And then I knew you'd be fun to me on Twitter.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.380]   So I'm gonna go.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.820]   You got a hardcore Google fans on Google+ following you.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.460]   Well, I'm glad you...
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.980]   What are you getting it or not?
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   You don't know.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   I don't know.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to the store on Friday and see whether I fall in love
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   with it or not.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.780]   Now, to back to Danny's question, it's sim-locked, but if you have paid out your contract...
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   Yeah, AT&T will unlock it.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.500]   AT&T's policy is to unlock it.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.940]   They say their policy is to unlock it even if you haven't paid out your contract.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.940]   As long as you're in good standing.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   Standing right.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.940]   I just don't know.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   Because you need to be able to take it to Europe or something.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.940]   So you say, "Hey, I'm going to Europe.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   Could you unlock this?"
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.940]   And they look at your bill.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.940]   Yeah, you pay it up.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.940]   Good.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.940]   Well, unlock it.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.940]   They don't have to do that.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.940]   But I think it's good that they do do that.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.340]   So I couldn't buy an off-contract one from AT&T, not having an AT&T contract at all.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.740]   And then I could get it with an un-lock the sim.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.540]   And I couldn't bring it to T-Mobile then.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.540]   No.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.260]   But you'd have to have a contract.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   That's why it's confusing.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.340]   You can't buy a phone unless you have a contract with AT&T.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.340]   And it's good that AT&T didn't extend your contract.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.340]   Carriers frequently will for any...
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   That's why I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.340]   Well, my problem is that if they muck with my contract, that was an amn-not-it.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.340]   You didn't want that.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.340]   I understand that.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.340]   Well, no, the problem is I have a grandfather unlimited data.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.340]   So I never want to mess with the contract.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.340]   Right.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.340]   Yeah, I mean, I'll give you an example of crazy loopholes.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   If you go to Verizon and you're due for an upgrade, if you pay the full price, they'll keep your unlimited data.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.340]   If you use the upgrade price, they'll use as an excuse to kill your unlimited data.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.340]   Yes.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.340]   So there's a wonderful man named Hugo in the audience who just got his Moto5.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.340]   He's very excited, who works for AT&T.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.340]   And when I had this problem once, he was nice enough to go into the store.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   It's very confusing.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.340]   It's a store in my unlimited.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.340]   That is good.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.340]   So the idea...
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.340]   I mean, and you can do this, and you will be able to do this.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.340]   The problem is everybody's in a hurry.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.340]   But you will be able to do everything you want.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:14.340]   They plan to put it not only on every carrier, but to offer unlocked on carrier locked versions.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.340]   Is that on Friday as well?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.340]   Do we do that?
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.340]   No.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.340]   I don't think so.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.340]   Well, I don't know.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.340]   I don't know.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.340]   But my guess is no.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.340]   Because the carriers announced the dates, you know.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.340]   That wasn't announced by Motorola or Google.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.340]   That's up to the carriers when they're going to announce it.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.340]   That's why there isn't one date.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.340]   And at some point, I'm sure in the next month or two, depending...
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.340]   See, there's this interlocking dependency between Motorola and the carriers.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.340]   They wanted it on every carrier.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.340]   They actually didn't get T-Mobile.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.340]   Sprint still hasn't announced a date.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.340]   For the Apple announced their dates?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.340]   Apple hasn't even announced that there's a new phone.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.340]   Well, I think it's...
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.340]   I can't.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.340]   But when they do announce there's a new phone.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.340]   I mean, doesn't it come out in the Apple store and the carrier stores kind of at the same time?
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.340]   Yes.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   Apple's so unusual because they have so much leverage.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.340]   Apple tells you what's going to be...
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.340]   They tell the carriers and that's unheard of.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   And in fact, I think Motorola did a lot of strong arming with the carriers because there's only two AT&T apps on this phone, for instance.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.340]   But I think that they obviously...
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:21.340]   In order to do that, they'd say, "Okay, you'll have the exclusive on the Moto Maker and blah, blah, blah."
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   Now, when does the...
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.340]   I don't get what...
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.340]   Would not announce yet.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.340]   If they sold it to you direct, what do I care?
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.340]   I'll just buy it direct from you without the discount.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.340]   I'll put it on my AT&T account if I want to.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   That would have to come from Motorola or Google.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.340]   But why not?
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.340]   Why...
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.340]   Because AT&T said, "I'm sure we want a window of exclusivity."
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   You know, I was buying...
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   There's...
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.340]   Leo's right there.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.340]   I was buying it myself, Danny, through the Moto Maker and the Moto Maker is exclusive.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   It's AT&T right now.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   And we'll be...
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.340]   They haven't said...
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.340]   Also, haven't said how long.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.340]   But I would bet you will be not for very long, a few months at most.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.340]   Well, a few months for no, so I'm moving on to the phone.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.340]   Well, I know.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   And that's the problem is you and I and Jeff and all, we all want the...
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.340]   You know, we're in a hurry.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.340]   But this is going to take a few months to play out.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.340]   I think by next...
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   By early next year, you'll be able to get it on any store.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   You'll be able to customize it on any...
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:23.340]   One speculation, which is probably true, is that they didn't want all these millions of phones to come to Moto Maker.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.340]   They wanted us to trickle it out.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.340]   It may not even be an AT&T thing.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.340]   It might have been, you know, we can only do so much.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.340]   At first, we'll make sure that we've got the production line.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   They've already pulled back on engraving.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.340]   Yes.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   The saying, "We're not happy with how it's looking.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.340]   Andy and Aco got one."
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.340]   And they said, "You know, we're not happy with how it's looking.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.340]   Can't belay that."
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.340]   They pulled back on the snaps.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.340]   They weren't going to ship those.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.340]   And then they decided, "Oh, I guess we got it working."
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.340]   So, you know, the smart thing probably would have been just...
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.340]   They'd belay this all longer, but I think they wanted to get it.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.340]   I think they wanted to get into the market and get the attention before iPhone 5.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.340]   Well, they might be...
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.340]   If there is, in fact, the Nexus 5, they also need some gap between...
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   So, what's the speculation that it'll be from LG?
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   There's LG and Motorola speculation, both.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.340]   I don't think it'll be LG, because LG just did the last one.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.340]   They usually rotate them around.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.340]   See, I think the Moto X is the closest thing to an Nexus 4 that's on the market.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   It's very simple.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.340]   It's a no-brainer to just take the Moto X and say, "This is the Nexus 5 Google Edition,
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.340]   whatever, whatever."
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.340]   Right?
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.340]   They've told me they're not going to do a Google Edition.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   That makes sense.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   Or...
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.340]   I don't know.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.340]   How are you liking your phone, Gina?
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.340]   She likes the one.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.340]   She likes the one.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.340]   I like the one a lot.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.340]   I like the one a lot.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.340]   I like the one a lot.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.340]   She's nice and calm, Gina.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.340]   She waits.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.340]   She patiently thinks it through.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.340]   And all the weak, girly boys over here are just going to store them
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.340]   by the new shoes when they're there.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.340]   I'm struggling with, because I like the S4.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.340]   I have a reunion that they sent me.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.340]   It's been awesome.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.340]   Really?
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.340]   I've gotten really to load it mostly because of all the crap on it.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   I don't have that much crap on it.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.340]   Actually, there's just not that much that gets in my way.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.340]   What I miss the most is there's no photosphere on it.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.340]   Really miss that.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   But I actually, and I'm going to try to write a call on it, but one of the things I appreciate
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.340]   is there's a lot of camera settings that I get in it that I actually use.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.340]   The burst mode was awesome.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   I'm like someone's doing karate.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.340]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah, you went into birth mode.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.340]   You hold it down.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.340]   It shot like 30 things in like two seconds."
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.340]   Which was pretty cool, because then Google turned it into an animated GIF.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.340]   And it was really scary.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.340]   So I really appreciated that.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   But I've been thinking about the one as well.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.340]   I just like to see how the different manufacturers do it.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.340]   And then I have this weird thing where I struggle with.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   I want to have the Galaxy S4.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.340]   And I want the Galaxy S4 is pure Android.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   So I want to buy the Google edition, but I want to switch on the sides.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.340]   I can just flip it and see it with the Samsung stuff if I want it.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.340]   I have very unique needs.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.340]   We all do.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   Yeah, we all do.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.340]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.340]   That's why I don't have a lot of sympathy for Jeff, because I buy everything.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.340]   And I never have full price.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.340]   And my contracts are infinite at this point.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.340]   And it's just the way it is.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.340]   And with all four carriers.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   Oh, man.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   I have a full mobile one.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.340]   When Bradley gets out of.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.500]   The one thing I have has really changed me over the years now is I've always had an Android
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   phone on Verizon.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.340]   And when the next iPhone comes out, that's going to Verizon.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.060]   Because when I go out, like it's an event or whatever, you should like to have a Verizon
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.340]   phone and at least an AT&T phone.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.340]   So I've got back on hot spots and everything.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.340]   And Verizon has just been so pissy with the Android stuff.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.340]   I never know if a phone's going to get updated.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   It's been such a nightmare with the Galaxy Nexus that I'm done.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.340]   It's like I will get an iPhone with Verizon and that's it with Verizon because I know they
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   can't mess with Apple.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.340]   But Android, they'll do whatever they want with.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   So it's like, yeah, well, I'm done with you.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   But I also think it's interesting to address what you brought up, Jeff, this resale issue.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.340]   And I will be interested to see if they do that on Friday.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.340]   Or if that's just pre-release.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:16.340]   If you go to their, they've got all folksy and their worrying.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.340]   They spent a lot of time, and I salute them for this.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:24.340]   They wrote the terms of sale in, sorry, I meant shorter.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   I'm sorry too.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.340]   What they don't want to see is people buy these and selling them for $1,200 on eBay, which
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.340]   happens often.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.340]   But they can't control that.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.340]   No, I don't think they can legally say no.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.340]   I don't think they can legally prevent it.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:42.340]   And I'm trying to sign in here that they did a very folksy job of doing this.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   Which is to convince you, frankly, since they don't, I don't think they have the legal.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.340]   Well, yeah, someone spent time writing a very clever, fun, easy to read.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.340]   We're going to try to explain it to you.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.340]   And then it's like, you're not a store.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.340]   Right.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.340]   Okay.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.340]   Yeah, I'm not a store.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.340]   You're not also not the boss of me about what I'm going to do.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.340]   I think that's my point.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.340]   So here's, here's an example.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.340]   You're not the boss of me, Motorola.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.340]   What is this like?
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.140]   It was like, it's like, yes or okay, that's funny.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:19.020]   You know, but I think the first sale doctrine, it completely eliminates any legal rights they
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.340]   have to say you can't resell it.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.340]   But they can, they can assert that, try to discourage.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.340]   Somebody pointed out that what they can do potentially is, you know, wipe the phone.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.340]   Wipe it.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   That's like the thing with Google Glass, right?
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.140]   That potentially they could take your glass unit.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.740]   Then they go into, into eBay and stop somebody from selling.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.140]   But see, that's why I think it's very similar to the terms for Google Glass, which is, you
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.940]   can, you can gift it, but you can't rezuh.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.540]   But my, here's the wording.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.140]   It says purchase payment terms colon show us the money, ask the mission point, right?
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.140]   You're not a store.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.340]   You're buying this phone for yourself or to give as a gift.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.140]   We can't let you resell it and we take that very seriously.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.540]   Now, how do you think you are the NSA?
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.940]   Well, and that's the question.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.260]   I mean, they said that with Glass because it's developer program and that's why I don't,
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.140]   if that's still there on Friday, we'll see.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.940]   Then that's, then that's, then there's a big question.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.060]   Other people got objective because they, it's just so kind of childish.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:22.340]   So it's, you know, one heading is shipety doodah, shipety a, we use FedEx.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.340]   They say that?
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.340]   Yes, they do.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.340]   I bet you that's toned down to you.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340]   Yeah, this is a different thing than glass.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.580]   I mean, glass was an invite only white listed, you know, the Explorer program where glass
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.140]   was paired to your Google account, which was white listed as a glass explorer.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.780]   It was a, it was a different thing, right?
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.980]   This is a, this is a consumer product that anybody can buy.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   It seems crazy.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.980]   Well, but no, not yet.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.140]   Only people who is very similar.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.220]   So I'm saying these might be explore, if equivalent of explorer terms, if it's still
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.420]   there on Friday, then it's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.820]   yeah, but it may not be there on Friday, it may just be a challenge.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.780]   Coming up next week, do we still hate Moto or not?
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.780]   So clearly by the time we can get the Moto X on the terms in which we want it, we'll,
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.260]   the Nexus 5 will be out.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.260]   We'll get that.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.260]   The point.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.740]   By the time I get the unlock version that I want by the Nexus 5.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.660]   So you know, the.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.700]   By the way, you can buy the Moto X on eBay right now.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.380]   It's unlockable for $950.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.340]   So get on out there and get it.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.340]   Yep.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.380]   What does it have would?
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.140]   No, no, this does, this is black or white.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.340]   Does it have a carrier logo on it?
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   It didn't look like a month.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   It doesn't look like it.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.340]   It's not available in full.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   Nobody cares, right?
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.340]   Right.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.780]   So yeah, I'm, I can't wait to get a gold iPhone.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.540]   That's going to make this whole thing moot.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.540]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.060]   That's like getting bling on your teeth.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   I know.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   A grill.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.060]   I want a grill.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.740]   Here's a phone for you can get for a mere, what was it, $695.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.900]   We should give them a little plug, 10 hours left to buy the Ubuntu Edge.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:03.660]   They're raising money on Indiegogo to make a phone that is dual boot, Android or Ubuntu
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:09.380]   and can run a computer for gigs of RAM, 128 gig storage.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:16.580]   However, they say that they can only make this if they can raise $32 million on Indiegogo.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.700]   They've raised $12.4 million to date.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.900]   They only have 10 hours left.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.140]   I'm thinking they're not going to make it.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.740]   But maybe if every one of you, each and every one of you listening to this show, collapse
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.540]   your hands three times and say, I do believe in new Ubuntu.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.300]   I do believe in Ubuntu.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   It'll happen.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.660]   Well, the most successful crowdfunding campaigns, one of the highest grossing crowdfunding
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.660]   campaigns ever.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.660]   And it's still not enough.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.700]   A cent of that's $12.4 million because they set it up so that they wouldn't get any of
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.660]   the money if they didn't get all of it.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.660]   It's amazing that they raised $12 million.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.700]   I mean, that's amazing, but $12 million, $832 million.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.260]   $32 million a lot.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.060]   Maybe they should have been to Corona-Kimos.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.860]   There are manufacturing a phone, a premium phone.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.860]   Right.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.100]   And they want to do it right.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.300]   What is, let me just open my calculator.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.420]   I could probably ask Google now this.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.900]   What is 32 million divided by 695?
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.700]   That would tell us roughly how many phones they need, they say, we need to sell this
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:13.700]   many phones.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.380]   You're not doing my voice?
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.140]   No, I should, but I'm.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.620]   So they need, actually, you know what?
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.380]   It's only 46,000 phones.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.660]   So let's say that 6,000 goes to overhead.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660]   That's their only saying.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:31.620]   We, if we don't, if we can't sell 40,000, we won't do it.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.620]   I think we could demand.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.700]   That seems fair, but it's a lot of money.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.500]   That's the greatest market research you could do.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   Right.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.100]   What's critical mass to make this profitable?
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.660]   I put my 700 bucks in.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.900]   I can't really do more than that, but since I have 18 phones.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.540]   Well, you usually buy five things.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.580]   I am sorry.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.820]   Wait, I am now in a bad situation.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.340]   I have more phone, more active phones than I've ever had before.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.300]   Oh, it's not good.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   How many?
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   It's not good.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.660]   I have two HTC ones.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.660]   I have a Moto X.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.220]   I have a, I let my Galaxy S4 to I as.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.860]   I have a Nexus 4 and then on an iPhone 5.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.860]   Yeah, but you need all those because you need to accessorize.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.860]   If I go to Apple, I want to take the iPhone.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   If I want to go to Google, I need to have a Nexus 4.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.860]   That's true.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.740]   When I go up to Microsoft, then I've got the 8X or whatever.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.740]   That's why the Facebook phone was so great because I'd always get mixed up over what
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.380]   the hell I was with to carry there.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.100]   Then they came out with the one.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.860]   To me, it sold purpose or whatever the first.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:36.180]   The next time I head up there, I'll dust off the first and then I'll be ready to go.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.140]   Google Voice routes them all everywhere, so it's awesome.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.940]   Thank God for Google Voice.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.940]   Except I hit the 5.0.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.700]   I hit it and put it in one of these.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.700]   It's like 5.0 minutes.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.700]   You can't have six lines.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   What?
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.460]   5.0 minutes.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:54.740]   We don't normally talk about iPhones, but I think it's worth bringing this up because
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.220]   this could make a big difference in the world.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.460]   I have now heard it from enough sources that I believe it that there is going to be, in
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:08.580]   fact, a fingerprint reader on the iPhone, the iPhone 5S.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:14.020]   If it's accurate and reliable, that could be a huge deal.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.180]   I was just talking about how I don't have a pin code.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.220]   I know and I know we've talked about it here on the show and I know Leo, you told me that
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.220]   I should.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:27.220]   I don't have a pin lock on my phone because I pick up my phone 20 to 30 times a day and
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.380]   the amount of time that I would spend swiping to unlock it.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.900]   See, that's a reason for the Moto X.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.580]   I hope that this feature makes it to other phones.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:38.060]   When you're in an authenticated Bluetooth area, you can say this is a trusted area.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.140]   When you're sitting next to your computer or in your car, you wouldn't have to do that.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   That's a great feature.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.140]   I love that feature.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.140]   The fingerprint scanner isn't even better feature.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   I think so.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:52.380]   I assume that the same exact action, you take the same exact action to unlock your iPhone
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.860]   whether the fingerprint scanner was on or off, but the fingerprint scanner will let
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.940]   you in if it's your finger.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.580]   That to me, when you look at the different security measures, I'm sure you talked about
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.420]   this with Steve a lot, PGP and Two Step Off, security generally equals complete pain and
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.020]   the rear.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:15.340]   It means spending more effort, spending more time, setting things up and verifying what
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.420]   the secondary things.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:21.700]   The fingerprint scanner is just same action by default, but adds an extra layer of security.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:26.740]   It's like websites that automatically redirect you to the HTTPS version.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.380]   It doesn't require any extra user intervention.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.380]   That's innovation.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.540]   That's what security has to look like.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.620]   Right now, security looks like going way out of your way.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:42.580]   If you're David Miranda, the Guardian reporter, the Guardian Walts husband, and you're in
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:50.020]   Heathrow for nine hours and they make you give them the password for his accounts.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.740]   Do they make you put your finger on the phone?
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.820]   They'd have to.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.660]   Did they make him give the passwords, by the way?
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:02.020]   I know they seem not to the thumb drives, but they went rolling around his calendar.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.060]   Could he have reasonably said no?
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   What is the crime?
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.660]   They just kept saying, you don't cooperate, you're going to jail and he had no lawyer.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.660]   That's so horrible.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.860]   It's so horrendous.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.460]   It's this is awful.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.780]   Because we're talking a journalist, not even a journalist, the husband of a journalist.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.780]   Right.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.020]   There's no privilege like there.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.340]   Well, one thing you could say is that he has been helping Glenn.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.620]   He's been doing work for the Guardian.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.220]   He was doing a journalistic, but all the more so.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.860]   He was either way, either way.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   Either way.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   It's appalling.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.820]   If they go after him as Glenn's husband, then that's pure harassment.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.420]   And if they go after him when he's on a journalistic task, that's harassment of journalism too.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.060]   Either way, they're wrong.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.060]   It's appalling.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.820]   They were wrong in the first place because there's no reasonable suspicion that he's
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.820]   a terrorist.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.820]   That's right.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.820]   Which is what they...
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.820]   Well, that too.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.820]   The other great...
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   But this ties in to...
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   Now we're in this.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.140]   This ties into the phenomenal story of GCHQ up to number 10 Downing Street, destroying
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:01.220]   the computers at the Guardian.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.220]   And this is the job.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.100]   As if A that stops anything.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.580]   Well, they know that Al the rest of which have been very clear, we they told them this
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.900]   will do nothing, and we still have other copies.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   It's punitive.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   But it was punitive.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.900]   It was harassment.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:19.100]   Now, the one argument they could possibly make is, well, if it's in the UK, we don't
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.140]   want any Chinese spies getting it on our turf, so we just don't want this stuff here.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.140]   Right?
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.380]   That's the closest you can come to legitimate.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:34.420]   But this ridiculous scene where they destroyed them in the basement with the spooks watching
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.060]   on.
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.060]   And so I tweeted...
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.460]   The Russman reported a picture of the computers, and I tweeted that this should be an exhibit
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.020]   in the museum in Washington for...
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.140]   This is what prior restraint looks like, folks.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.620]   And the museum said, "Yes!"
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.900]   And Russman just said, "Yes."
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.980]   So these things, probably two museums, one part of it's going to go to the museum in Washington,
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.100]   and that's the artifact of what they did.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.860]   But in both cases, there's material they already have.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.860]   So what are they going to do?
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   If they...
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.540]   If they harass David Miranda, and if they did manage to break into the key, what are they
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.540]   going to find?
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.340]   The documents that are already there.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.380]   Same with Guardian stuff.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.860]   It's pure harassment theater.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:23.500]   And it really is a chilling effect on something we need desperately, which is good journalism.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   Well, and so is...
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.020]   We should mention this.
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.940]   So is the sentencing of Bradley Manning to that.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.940]   35 years.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:31.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:32.940]   That is a chill on journalism.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.780]   That is a chill on sources.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.580]   It is a chill on free speech.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.220]   It is a chill on watch-dogging the government.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:45.460]   It is a shameful, shameful moment in America.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.500]   And on that happy note...
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.460]   Well, well, well.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.620]   But I'm with you 100%.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.620]   I'm with you 100%.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.620]   I have a lot of pain.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.620]   I can bring the show down.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.500]   Manning is a little more complicated.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.740]   He was a soldier on duty.
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.220]   He had made oaths and so forth.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.820]   So it's more complicated.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:15.700]   I think the difficulty we're running in it, I agree with Leo, is like, you know, you...
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.940]   We have stuff that we want secret.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.540]   There are some things we would like to have protected.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.220]   You don't want someone, for example, going through and deciding that, "Hey, I'm going
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.780]   to steal everybody's birth dates and social security numbers and put it out there because
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   that's secret."
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.780]   Right?
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.980]   I mean, there's stuff that we do try to protect.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.100]   And there are people who are given access to material and agree to have that thing.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.500]   And I think the balance you're trying to find is, at what point does the obligation you
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:49.900]   agree to protect information become outweighed by the obligation to correct even worse illegalities
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.700]   that are happening because of the information?
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.700]   Exactly.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.700]   Yeah, there was a new show.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.700]   Exactly.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.900]   And what I'm finding most disturbing is now that we're not seeing any kind of a push toward
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.420]   saying, "You know what?
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.100]   We're having these whistleblowing things happening because there are bad things that require
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.100]   them to be happening.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.780]   What are we going to do to get that balance right?"
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.660]   You know, the Obama administration right now, it just seems to...
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.620]   I mean, they keep saying stuff about Snowden.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.860]   Like, "Well, he's not a dissident.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   He's not a whistleblower."
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.700]   It's like, "Yeah, actually, he's matching those criteria very well."
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   That's exactly what he is.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:27.380]   And you're not putting yourself into a position of saying, "What do we do to make and accommodate
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:32.060]   this kind of situation so that if people feel like something is really going bad, first
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.100]   of all, they can get it corrected without having to go to the media."
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.460]   And then secondly, if they do go to the media, they have some alternative to say, "You know
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.460]   what?
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.660]   I know that you want to put me up for 100 trillion years worth of, "I'm going to go to prison"
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.660]   or whatever.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.540]   But my argument is, under federal whistleblower laws, I actually have a protection in the legal
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.780]   obligation or a right or whatever to step forward and say, "No."
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.500]   You know, in the same that way that we have laws that came after Nuremberg to say that,
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.180]   "You know, you don't just follow orders.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.940]   You don't just do things if something is wrong."
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.380]   And that is a tough balancing act.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.540]   And right now, I don't see anything that's coming on the US side of saying, "We're going
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.300]   to get the balancing act better."
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.940]   I see them occasionally saying, "Well, we should have more oversight of our secret courts."
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.180]   Maybe we don't need to have the secret courts.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.020]   Or, you know, I mean, then...
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.020]   No, I'm with you.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.780]   And of course, the president and his press conference a couple of weeks ago said that
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:26.580]   there are internal, whistle-blowing procedures that people like Snowden or Manning could
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.580]   have used, but I have no comment.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.740]   Well, he was wrong, Leo.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.220]   He said that Snowden was protected under that, but contractors were not.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   That was wrong.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:40.020]   And even if he would have been, I'm not sure I would have had the confidence that that would...
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.020]   Go to Diane Feinstein?
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.620]   Yeah, that's going to get you very far.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   And that's it.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.140]   By the way, that's the bizarre thing I'm finding on this also, too, is like, I mean,
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:52.100]   I voted for Obama, I voted for Feinstein, and now I feel like he might as well have been
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.100]   from the party or whatever.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.100]   I agree.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.100]   I agree.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.860]   I mean, you kind of think like, when you get there, do you just sort of like get brainwashed
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.820]   and everybody comes out the same in the end?
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:06.620]   Or I know the piece for the Guardian for this weekend that's going to go up.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   That's been troubling me a lot, Danny, because I'm in the exact same way.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   I mean, I didn't know for Feinstein, but I voted for Obama after having voted for Hillary
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   Clinton.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.420]   You couldn't, we should point out what for Feinstein.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.420]   She ran in California.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.420]   California, right?
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.620]   In fact, she's the reason I left California, but that's a whole other story.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.620]   Really?
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   Seriously.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620]   Go, yes.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   What?
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   Oh, I want to hear that one.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.620]   I'll tell you that in a second.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.620]   All right.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:36.220]   I'm not a president because I wrote this piece just saying basically, what are you thinking?
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:40.620]   Do you really want to go down in history as the president, the destroyed privacy and
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.900]   the fourth man's transparency and speech and so on?
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.420]   And I think it's the secrecy corrupts and absolute secrecy corrupts absolutely.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.300]   But you start to believe that if this is secret, this is power, and this is what we
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:57.700]   need to have, and that's where our vanished lies versus somebody else.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.580]   And I think that's kind of what happened to him.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:04.740]   He went down a vortex where the convince them that secrecy is what you have to have.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.460]   And secrecy is exactly what's causing this problem.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.020]   We don't know what's going on with our government.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.700]   It's causing a complete lack of trust in our government.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.780]   Well, that leads to that also lead to like, what was it?
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.980]   The lava soft, the guy with the email that I've a bit software.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:24.300]   The idea that he had to shut it down and then say, I can't even tell you what it was I was
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   served with.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.300]   Well, now they've been under risk.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.620]   But that just seems so fundamentally wrong.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.860]   I mean, that goes back to the fundamentals of why we have a constitution that says, you're
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.700]   going to be served with writs of why you're going to be accused.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.180]   You're not going to the idea that you can say is, I've been accused of something, but
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.140]   I can't tell you because it's a secret.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:46.020]   It's gotten worse because Ladar Levinson, the feds are now threatening him with prosecution
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.980]   for shutting down his service.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   Hey, we were going to have this great way to wiretap Snowden and others and you shut
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.300]   it down.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.220]   You're going to jail, buddy.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.460]   There's no way to correct what they would argue is the bad side.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.460]   Right.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.460]   So if they left for him, that's it.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.940]   That may just be saber rattling their mate, but the fact that they're even saying that
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.020]   is appalling.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:11.780]   And now of course, I don't I don't know if you guys follow a grock law, but that's a
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   great website.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.540]   Was that an over reaction?
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.180]   I think it was an over reaction.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:23.820]   I think she Pamela didn't really understand exactly what's going on.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.860]   I also think that PJ Pamela Jones who writes grock law, which is a great site for finding
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:33.060]   figuring out what the hell's going on in our legal system with the with regard to lawsuits
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.540]   and so forth.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.060]   I think she wanted to shut it down for other reasons at other times.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.580]   What was the what was this piece?
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.820]   Can we summarize what if you go to grocklaw.com you'll see her last post grock law.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:49.020]   I'm telling you it was a great site because email issue takes the love because email is
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.020]   no longer safe.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:54.220]   This site depends upon the anonymity and protection of anonymity through email.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:56.220]   Thus, I can't operate anymore.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.220]   Goodbye.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.220]   Period done.
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.020]   She just basically pulling the plug.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:08.620]   Kind of shocking, but and I think it is over reaction, but nevertheless, I don't think that
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.620]   I'm not trying to diminish.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.940]   No, the principle that she's addressing.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.940]   She's right.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.980]   But there would have been ways to address it.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.860]   I think.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   She says she's getting off the internet.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.980]   She's just disconnecting entirely the name of private.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.260]   She says my personal decision is to get off the internet to the degree it's possible.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:30.020]   I'm just an ordinary person, but I really know after all my research and some serious
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:35.780]   thinking through that I can't stay online personally without losing my humanness.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:39.540]   Now that I know that ensuring privacy online is impossible.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.860]   I find myself unable to write.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:42.180]   I've always been a private person.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.580]   That's why I never wanted to be a celebrity.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:47.340]   Why I far hard to maintain both my privacy and yours.
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.180]   I do think she's mentioned before that she wanted to stop doing Grecolaw that it was
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.980]   there were other reasons, but she does make a good point.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.820]   And you know, we've said this before.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.980]   It's hard to say that you're going to be private in any way.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.220]   It's very clear now if you use email, it's not private.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.860]   And what she's saying is that this is the chill.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.940]   This is this is this is.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:06.940]   And that it is the other.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.620]   I don't have faith.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.100]   So I'm leaving this.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.700]   Hey, I'm looking at I have been looking and will continue to look at ways to do this show
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.980]   outside of the United States.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.380]   Should it get much worse?
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.340]   Because it's not safe to be doing what we're doing right.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:26.140]   If it becomes unsafe and it could for us to do what we're doing right now, that's time
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   to leave.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.140]   Where would you go?
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.620]   I don't know.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   Iceland.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.980]   Uh, maybe Iceland.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.380]   That's where everybody else seems to want to go.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.020]   I'm thinking a boat.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.860]   If we go to Iceland, can we get Bjork on?
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:37.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.860]   Bjork on anyway.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.860]   Cool.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   I'm thinking a boat.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.940]   And pirate pirate radio offshore and international.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.380]   I like that image.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.500]   And I've been inquiring into the the issues the internet and I've been inquiring and we're
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.820]   making great progress.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:56.180]   If the Google Loon project just moves forward will be set.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:57.740]   Of course a boat could be.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.340]   If you boo, boo, loom balloons to follow us.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.340]   Exactly.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.580]   The truth is, you're kind of screwed no matter what.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.820]   There's nowhere in the world to go.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:05.820]   That's true.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.820]   That's true.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.780]   So why don't you like Dianne Feinstein?
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.340]   Why do you hate her so much that you left California?
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.340]   That was not it.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.340]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.260]   She drove me out.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.580]   So I was a columnist on...
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   Wow.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.580]   I was a columnist on the...
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.180]   And you're not talking to her Chevy Impala.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.140]   You're saying like a dog drives it.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   I'll make it really quick.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.940]   I only ticket to New York for you.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:33.740]   I'm still getting the fed to tar and the feathers off of me.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.500]   This is not my real beard.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.980]   Really?
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:42.420]   So I was a columnist on the examiner and I covered Feinstein and I think that for example
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.820]   I covered when Moscone and Milk were assassinated.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:49.700]   I covered her ascension and I praised her regularly.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.460]   But occasionally I would criticize her.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.900]   This is what I did.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.540]   Well, she went...
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.620]   You were either on her side or against her.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:02.260]   Her activities these days are true to that character.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.260]   It's very George Bush.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.820]   You're with us or against us.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.860]   And if you ever dared criticize her for anything, that reset the relationship and you were the
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.100]   enemy.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.940]   And she went after...
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:18.740]   She and her husband went after Reg Murphy, the publisher of the paper at the time, and
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.140]   made my life really difficult.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.340]   And I finally just said screw it when New York had found a job.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.340]   You're kidding.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340]   Wow.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340]   No, no, no.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340]   This is all true.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:34.060]   And so I came back and I announced my resignation and we rented out a Burger King for my farewell
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060]   party.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.060]   I did that.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.580]   And it was Chuck Mill got it.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.580]   There wasn't Chipotle at that time.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.580]   There wasn't there yet.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.580]   We didn't know.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.340]   And there wasn't an internet either.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.540]   And so my last day was on a Friday and that Monday, Reg Murphy announced his resignation
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.100]   and a wag on the seat of us said, "Well, Jarvis, once he got rid of you, he could go."
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.900]   His job done.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   Wow.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.100]   Yeah, Dick Blum is a very well-known developer and a real estate investor in San Francisco
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.300]   who wields a lot of power.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:28.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.

[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.300]   And I was a very well-known developer.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.940]   And LavaBit never was secure, because in order for email to be transported over the public
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:55.300]   internet, it cannot be encrypted by the email sending server.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.420]   Gmail is encrypted, but only if it's talking to another encrypted SMTP server, which are
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.980]   few and far between.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.620]   So in order for me to send somebody email a LavaBit, the chances are that email, unless
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.420]   I take further steps, is unencrypted.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.460]   So even LavaBit wasn't secure.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.980]   It just stored it securely.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.980]   But they had the keys.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.780]   So the government could ask for the keys.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.660]   And it's our suspicion that what happened was Lazar Levinson was asked for, not access
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:26.340]   to the database or somebody's key, but an ongoing exchange of all keys so the government
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.900]   had full access to LavaBit.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.700]   And it would make a great honeypot because LavaBit says, "Hey, it's secure.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.700]   It's private."
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.060]   Meanwhile, the government has full access to it.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.060]   So I think that's what we're talking about.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.060]   Not only that, it's recommended by Edward Snowden.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.060]   It's used by Edward Snowden.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.620]   What better to use?
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:45.460]   So the way to do it is use PGP or I use OpenPGP.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.020]   In fact, if you're on a Mac or a PC, it's very easy to install.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:58.820]   GPG4, the number 4WIN for Windows and GPG Tools for Mac, install it, get it, make a key,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:02.340]   put your key in a public place where people can download it.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.340]   That's what I do, mine's at leofil.com.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.220]   Then people can send you private email.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.060]   Once you get their keys, you can send them private email.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:13.540]   I plan on encrypting all mail to anybody who's key I have from now on just to mess with the
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   NSA.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.900]   And it stays that way through the whole process?
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:22.140]   Nobody can get it except you and your private key unless, of course, they hold you at Heathrow
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.180]   and demand your passphrase.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.580]   So what this means is that every single reporter on Earth should be publishing their public
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580]   key.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580]   Absolutely.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.980]   So if a whistleblower wants to come to them, they can send them private email.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.300]   Now, that's what we should all be doing.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:41.340]   Now, what you should also do is create a, the problem is the metadata also has to be unencrypted,
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.500]   otherwise there's no visible address.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:49.480]   So you should also probably, if you're a whistleblower, create a email account somewhere where you
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.980]   don't have to give them a credit card number or any personally identifying information.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.700]   You should use Tor or some other IP hiding system.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.820]   I mean, there's ways to do it.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.380]   It's hard.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.660]   But if you're a whistleblower, it's worth it.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:04.660]   All right.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:09.300]   So we have a, there's a know how episode, know how 50 or we show you how to use PGP.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   It's very good.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   It was the first thing that explained it to me.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.300]   Easy.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.300]   The geek will not.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   So it was very clear.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.300]   And I use it and you should look at Lee Oville.com.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.860]   You see, I post my key.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.620]   You also posted the public servers because then people could look up Jeff Jarvis and say,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.060]   oh, here's his key and they can encrypt to you.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.980]   And you have to, you have these, you can use the Gmail web client.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   You have to use a client.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980]   You can.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.060]   Which is a, which is a plugin for Gmail.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.980]   Oh, Mailvelope, right, right, right.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:41.500]   And you can, you can encrypt outside of your email client and cut and paste it in email
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.500]   client.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.980]   It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's absolutely done.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.980]   Yep.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.980]   Gotcha.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   Yep.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.980]   Very easy to do.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.980]   I have Mailvelope.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   Mailvelope's fine.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:54.620]   You know, there's some, you know, Darren Kitchen at hack fives done a couple of stories
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.620]   and how insecure it is.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.620]   It's not insecure.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.620]   He's wrong.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.620]   Oh, good.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.620]   Okay.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.620]   That's good to hear.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.620]   Thank you for that.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.780]   Well, I, you know, I've been, I have had a PGP piece since 1997.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.620]   I've been pushing this since 1997.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.620]   Nobody's ever done it.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.620]   Maybe now people will.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.060]   Because your point that if everybody does it, that is not a big deal.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.700]   But if only certain people do it, then they're like sort of automatically.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.340]   If you're in the New York Times and all of a sudden you're receiving a lot of encrypted
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.340]   email from somebody.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.180]   Yeah, that's going to raise some.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.720]   And the NSA has said, by the way, that they save all encrypted emails.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.660]   So you are in fact saying save me.
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.300]   That's why I'm going to start encrypting all my spam.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.300]   Enjoy.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.820]   You may not be aware that search engines are very important if you switch links.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.060]   Would you like to link to me?
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.140]   No, if you read, and you know, if the NSA manages in some distant future to decrypt
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.820]   my email, they're going to be very disappointed.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.420]   It's very trivial.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420]   Google ready to buy it.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   It's way into the NFL.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:05.120]   I hope Peter Kafka's right writing for all things D fascinating.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.120]   Google is according to what rumors?
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:15.440]   According to sources, Larry Page, along with Robert Kinsell at YouTube, have met with a
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.800]   delegation from the NFL led by NFL commissioner Roger Godell.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.640]   According to these sources, the Sunday ticket package was among the topics.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.160]   This was the TV rights for NFL Sunday tickets.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.720]   And all you can eat subscription TV service is currently owned by direct TV.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.760]   Wouldn't you love that on your Chromecast?
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.200]   No, I don't like the NFL.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   I would buy it.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.880]   I know I know I know I know I'm a queen and everything, but 150 bucks a year.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   No problem.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   No problem.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   And it's one of the things that keeps people from cord cutting, frankly.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   Nice.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   Nice.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.520]   They offered it because then direct TV wouldn't keep trying to put it on my bill.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.880]   I have it to you for four months free.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   And then I'm like, all right, whatever.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.920]   And they bill and like, yeah, I don't want that.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.120]   I didn't want it in the first place.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.000]   So Google declined to comment.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.120]   NFL hasn't responded to Peter Kafka's story.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.320]   And, you know, it's a chat and NFL's meeting with other companies as well.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.920]   It's something they do this every year.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:21.200]   We should mention the rights direct TV pays a billion dollars a year for those rights.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.000]   Oh, nothing.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Chicken feed.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Chicken feed.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.240]   We just got that in their couch cushions.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   You know, it wouldn't merely be to promote the idea of internet, television, et cetera,
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   et cetera.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.600]   Remember Google's business is an ad business and there's no ads more valuable than NFL ads.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   The Super Bowl ad.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.800]   The ads where you actually know you're watching it then.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   Right.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.560]   It's the last room that alive TV.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.720]   And given that an average NFL game has 11 minutes of action buried in three hours of
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.920]   ads gives you some idea.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:08:00.520]   No, this is interesting to imagine if the game is embedded in a player or what you could
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.520]   do with advertising.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.620]   That's right.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.880]   So much more, right?
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.280]   And that's the pitch Google could make to the NFL will give you a billion dollars and a
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   cut.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.880]   How about and and because we can target the advertising to the individual viewer, we can
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.360]   multiply the value of the advertising.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.040]   So really it's worth much more to Google than it is to direct TV.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.640]   They could maybe even offer to double who knows who knows.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   I don't know.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.840]   I like it.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.880]   When we come back, we're going to talk more about maps, YouTube.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.760]   We can even talk about Facebook if you feel like it.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.120]   Twitter and Bitcoin.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.640]   But first a word from legal zoom.com legal zoom is not a law for me.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.280]   You might think from the name legal zoom.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.240]   It sounds like a very, very, very high speed law firm zooming down the highway of life.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:58.080]   But in fact, it's a way of giving you, empowering you, the consumer to do a lot of the legal
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.720]   work you need to do without paying big legal fees.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.120]   They provide self help services at your specific direction.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.880]   August, which is rapidly coming to a close is national make a will month.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.440]   I can't it's like backup.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.160]   It's one of those things where I can't believe people aren't, you know, might be in test
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.720]   state.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720]   It's painful.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.240]   Do not be in test state.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.080]   You need your test dates.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:27.280]   Go to legal zoom right now and you'll get 15% off your last will.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.720]   But this offer and soon or you can get a living trust and receive a pour over will absolutely
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   free.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.000]   You need to use our offer code twig to get this deal.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.200]   If you're doing other legal work, LLCs and corporation, trademark patent applications,
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.080]   you can do that at legal zoom as well.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.280]   And if you use the offer code twig, you'll take 10 bucks off of those.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.280]   So really legal zoom is fabulous.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.680]   And this is something they've added since I use them to incorporate a twit.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.920]   They now have the legal zoom legal plan.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.520]   State by state attorneys that you can trust for pre negotiated, very affordable fixed rates
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.480]   to give you the answers you need.

[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.920]   Germany says Bitcoin is private money subject to capital gains tax.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.400]   This was just a matter of time.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.880]   What else?
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.600]   The new tweets per second record has been set by an old Japanese manga movie.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.560]   And it's live airing in Japan.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.600]   Danny, you have anything to say about this?
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.600]   143,000 tweets in one second.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.280]   I guess my reaction is kind of like, okay, great.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.160]   I don't need any more posts about how you manage to do it.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.400]   I'm just glad that you're doing it.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.240]   We haven't seen the fail well.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.920]   What was the last time you saw a fail?
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.520]   I was like, what I do want to know on a regular basis is when someone sets a new record.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.080]   I think that's fascinating.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.560]   I suppose there's some people want to know how it's all architect, but whether it's Facebook
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.440]   or Google or whatever, the whole.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   And we've managed it.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.680]   It's like, yeah, we just kind of figured you should be able to do that.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680]   I know.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.480]   But if you're an engineer sitting in a data center where you have done herculean things
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.520]   that no one even thought possible five years ago to support that kind of network traffic,
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   you want to tell me.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.280]   But the manga thing, I mean, it was fascinating that that did it.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.280]   It was an old movie.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.880]   It was always, always fascinated by what pops up more.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880]   How did it go?
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.160]   I wish actually Twitter made it easier to spot that stuff.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   I would love it.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.680]   You could just be like, like when Shark when Sharknado happened, you know, from my stream,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.280]   I thought the entire world must have been obsessed by it.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   Right.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   And it turned out it was like, yeah, it was a certain it was a certain segment.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.280]   Yes, it was our segment.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.800]   Yeah, very sad friends.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   Yes.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.280]   But that was useful to know.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   I kind of want to look at that stuff.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.720]   You guys see the magic recs?
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.240]   I find all that fascinating.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   Magic what?
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   Magic recs.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.800]   I think it's, let me see.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800]   What's that?
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   Magic recs.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   Magic rec.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.400]   And magic, like the word magic followed by REC.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.160]   I just did that earlier today because it's been awesome.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.440]   Yeah, it's a Twitter handle.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.840]   And so when you follow it, it's a Twitter experiment.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:04.480]   And when you follow it, it DM's you when a bunch of your friends follow a new person
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.840]   or a bunch of your friends are talking out a particular news story.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.040]   So and it's really good.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.040]   I followed it a few weeks ago and it's definitely pointed me toward new stuff that I'm interested
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040]   in.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.280]   And it's based on what your friends are doing.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   Oh, magic recs as in recommendations.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   Yes.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280]   Yeah, real time.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280]   Magic recs.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   All right.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.600]   So I follow them.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.040]   And then what happens?
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.640]   And then so now you just kind of wait and they will send you a direct message because
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.560]   when you follow them, they follow you and then they'll send you a direct message.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.280]   So a bunch of your friends, a bunch of my friends today, followed Drew Barrymore, right?
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.720]   She just joined Twitter.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.240]   So I got a DM from Magic recs that said, Hey, this person, this person, this person, all
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.400]   people who I follow just followed Drew Barrymore.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.920]   Oh, so it's like, it's like who to follow.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.320]   It's like who to follow, but it's way better.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320]   It's way better.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   It's worthless.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320]   Yeah, it's kind of worthless.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.840]   And then I'll also give you links as well, right?
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.040]   Danny, it'll, if more than a few of your friends tweet a link to something, it'll, it'll DM
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   that to you.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's, it's great because it's sort of like a, a notification of what happened
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.200]   with a bunch of just your friends.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.360]   And that's what's been really compelling about it.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.160]   Like the one I got yesterday, I know I got it this morning and that's why I tweet is
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   it like this is, this is amazing because I've been doing the same thing.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.000]   And it was like a bunch of people follow internet.org, which just came up on Twitter because of
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.560]   the whole Facebook thing.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.360]   And so I didn't know that account existed.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.080]   So when I saw it, I was like, you know, but other people I followed did it suddenly discover
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   it.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.720]   And so same thing like I discovered a bunch of people followed, um, board a lawn musk.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.880]   Yes, I got that one too.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.840]   That was like what?
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.960]   Um, so he has an account that was there and I might have helped generate the, like the
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.960]   boot drew thing.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.840]   I saw somebody else come on, like Drew's not on Twitter yet.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.240]   So I'm like, yeah, following her.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.200]   And she followed me right back.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   It was great.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.880]   Boardy, that's actually a pretty funny account as well.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.040]   That's an invention for Milan in his downtime.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.360]   A futuristic hyper parody account.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.400]   Um, but yeah, Patrick is pretty cool.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   So Leo, you'll start to get, you'll start to get DMS.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.720]   Something has to happen like a few.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.920]   I haven't gotten any yet.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.000]   So, but you'll see when you get them, you'll, you'll be like, Oh, this is, you know, this
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   is actually useful.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.360]   I think this show is better than that.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.960]   I've already gotten two people to follow board, Elon Musk and direct Rex.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   So there.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.880]   And Drew and Drew.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.800]   No, I'm not going to follow through Barrymore.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   Sorry.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.040]   She was very concerned that she was late to the party.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.520]   Oh, no, just a little, Drew.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.960]   I don't follow celebrities because they don't tweet for themselves.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.440]   They're using who say and sit.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   Special.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.840]   Some of them are great to watch.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.120]   You watch them.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   It's fascinating.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.040]   Sometimes when I don't know, they, some of the celebrities are awesome to follow because
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.400]   you know, they really are themselves and they're treating things and they don't.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   I find it fascinating.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.440]   And I find it fascinating when two different celebrities, I've been meaning to make examples
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.960]   of this, that you don't expect, start talking to each other like a William Shatner.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:13.960]   Right.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:14.960]   He hurt.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   That was fun.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   That was too.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   Came together.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960]   But you know, that would be fun.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   But then the other ones are boring.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   Who cares?
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.480]   I think, I think William Shatner did tweet Christopher Hadad.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.480]   What was his name?
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.400]   The Canadian, Canadian captain of the ISS.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   So that was.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400]   He's real.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.040]   What's his name?
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   Rock Center.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.280]   Rock, I mean, the three rock.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.080]   30 Rock the.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.560]   We're old guys now.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.760]   I can't come up with a name.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.920]   I want to say William Windham, but I know it's Alec Baldwin.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   Alec Baldwin.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   Folding Alec Baldwin.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.920]   He's ladies.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.440]   Lady, Lady Gaga is herself.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440]   Ladies real.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.120]   And have you been following her back and forth about Perez Hilton?
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120]   I know.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.120]   I didn't see that.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.280]   Oh my God.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.880]   He posted how upset she is about the Manning sentence.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   Oh, good for Gaga.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   That's pretty interesting.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.880]   I think Gaga is definitely real.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   That's definitely her.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.040]   So wait, now look, I had to switch over to her all because of the faults to just, she
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.320]   going back and forth with.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.320]   No.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.040]   So somebody tweeted her or messaged her that Perez Hilton was in her building.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.280]   I didn't know they'd had a falling out.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.080]   And she said, if this is true, you need to tell me immediately.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.480]   And it was like this whole thing going on and on.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.160]   And then Perez Hilton starts tweeting her saying, your little monsters are killing me
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160]   here.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.080]   And oh my God, it went on and on and on.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   You'll have to search for it.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.760]   It's probably deleted on both their feeds by now.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.960]   But yeah, so that's both of those were real.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   Those were not publicists.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.920]   Scott Hope, I hope not.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.920]   Right.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:56.000]   Unlike Dr. Phil, who one of his producers tweeted, did you see this?
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.600]   They tweeted something like, you know, is it rape if you're drunk or?
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600]   Actually, they didn't say that.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.680]   They said, is it okay?
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.240]   They said, is it okay to have sex with somebody who is drunk?
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.000]   Which actually, I understand what he's asking.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.240]   But the little bitches on Twitter just went crazy.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.640]   Oh, everyone went nuts.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.360]   And he issued an apology saying that it was not him.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.360]   It was one of his producers.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   But you know what?
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.400]   You should say this is legitimate.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.120]   Is it consent if somebody is non-compassmentous?
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.760]   That's a legitimate question to ask.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.320]   I don't think there's a problem with that.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.720]   He was hoisted by the 140 characters.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.720]   That's all.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   That's Twitter storm.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.920]   We got to come up with a name.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.480]   For, yeah, it's true.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.880]   It was the way that it was word.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   It was poorly worded.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.960]   It was like, my girl is drunk.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.480]   Is it okay to have sex with her?
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.480]   Right.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.880]   And so which people took as if you don't have consent in for, you know, consent of someone
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.720]   who is, is it okay?
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   Which obviously is not good.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.240]   If they had more letters, they could have said, is a drunk person able to give informed
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.360]   consent to something like sex?
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.440]   That was the question.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.000]   And that's a legitimate question.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   Right.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.520]   I don't think that's a bad question.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.200]   And I think the Twitter people were, you know, all the reason I'm a little bitter is because
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.600]   I say one thing about somebody and every, and then all the little people on Twitter
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.640]   start telling that person, did you hear anything?
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.480]   They want to stir up that kind of stuff.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   They love that.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.080]   It's the Howard Stern problem too.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   The what?
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   Howard Stern problem.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]   He complains about that as well.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.240]   That he can say one thing and doesn't matter if the person is listening.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   They'll hear it.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.240]   You can't say anything about anybody anymore.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.240]   Used to be.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.240]   You could say stuff about people.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.440]   Trash about people in public, not anymore.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440]   No, sub-tweeting.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   You get caught.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.640]   Used to be.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.720]   I could slam people right and left all day.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.880]   No one will ever know.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.480]   Anything else to say before we get our tool tip and number.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.400]   Doo doo doo doo doo.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.960]   I promise I'm not going to make my tip the five guys Android Apple though.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   I'm tempted to.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.560]   Oh, that's just.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   I saw you.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   I saw you eating that burger.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.040]   Did you catch me eating that burger?
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.480]   I caught a quick, quick shot.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.480]   It was good.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   It looked good.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480]   You're a pro.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:16.120]   I'll just point Jeff up over here about Feinstein and I'll get this burger.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.640]   40 million registered vine users.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.920]   Wow.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.320]   I'm too old for vine, I think.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.320]   I go there.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   I'm going to buy that.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.720]   Somebody should buy that vine thing.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.240]   That thing is going to be huge.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   Twitter did hire a Google executive away to run their entertainment business.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:41.760]   I don't know if that means anything or not.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.840]   Jennifer Prince.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.000]   Well, hell, hell, hell, hell.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.920]   I'm saying helm because it's in variety.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920]   Well, helm.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.280]   Twitter's ad sales effort and movie TV biz.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   Eh.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.360]   Should we talk about internet.org?
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.120]   It's the latest internet.org.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120]   Tell me about that.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.440]   The Zuckerberg.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.440]   At all.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.880]   It's his balloons.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   His balloons.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.880]   Yeah, his balloons.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.880]   Yeah, his balloons.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   The Zuckerberg effort.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.120]   I guess internet.org is the site for it.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.240]   With Nokia and Samsung.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.080]   Every one of us everywhere connected.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.320]   Everyone should be right.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.320]   Watching ads from Facebook.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.160]   Watching ads from Facebook.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.320]   Just imagine what the world would be like if Facebook could track everyone on Facebook.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.400]   One of you instead of just one in seven of you.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.480]   I look at this and I think Mark Zuckerberg went to his publicist and said that goddamn
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.600]   Sergey Brin is getting all the attention.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.280]   Make me Tony Stark.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.160]   Today, the internet isn't accessible for two thirds of the world.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.240]   Imagine a world where it connects us.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.920]   The purple's got to go.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.440]   His plan is a lot less imaginative than internet connected balloons.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.040]   But it's pretty straightforward.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.520]   It's like less than the data that mobile apps take up.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.040]   Lower the cost of wireless data and make it worth it for businesses.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.640]   Any kind of set made the point of saying Facebook's not going to make a lot of money
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.080]   from these people because they're not rich.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.080]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.080]   We have an obligation.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.080]   Oh, there's a way.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   Everyone.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   Oh, yeah, there's a way.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   Right.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080]   A penny.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:23.920]   Six billion pennies adds up to some.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.920]   Yep.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:25.920]   Yep.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.560]   So maybe they could just do it here first.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.240]   Yeah, let's start in the US.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.400]   This would be good.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.360]   Why are up another San Francisco park?
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.960]   Could I get one other broadband provider in Newport Beach?
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.120]   Because we're fairly urban.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.720]   We could use some other options out here other than our cable network.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   It's ridiculous.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720]   I can't get.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720]   I can't get a.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.080]   There's like no alternatives.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.000]   So yeah, I'm frustrated.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.800]   I don't need to have Kansas have any more options.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.160]   But they have more options than I probably do.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.360]   I'm frustrated.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.280]   So it's a coalition with the wireless carriers.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:08.600]   We locked into this giant thing that cost me this huge contract forever and ever.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.360]   And they keep upping it and oh, and well, you're on a smartphone.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.800]   So we have to add another $10 onto that because as if anybody's not using a smartphone now
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:19.360]   and you know, oh, let's add in the other thing here, whatever.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:25.200]   So hey, Mark and Google, if you guys are so able to change the world, do you think you
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.000]   could change it right here in the United States?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.800]   Because you seem pretty powerless and unable to do that.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.200]   Having said that, yeah, I think it would be great if more people had internet access.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:42.480]   And then Times article quotes Bill Gates who says, you know, I don't know if getting internet
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.040]   access to the poorest people in the world is really important.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.320]   He says when a kid gets diarrhea, there's no website that relieves that.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.280]   That's such a, such a bogus argument.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.680]   It says that you can, the whole world can concentrate on only one problem.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.680]   Right.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:03.080]   The bills problem and anything else is then offensive because it doesn't deal with that.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.080]   He's right though.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.880]   The getting drinking water and good health care and of course it is.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.200]   This does not, this is not, it's not a zero sum game.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.160]   Yeah, I look at Africa and India.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:19.640]   These are incredibly developing economies where there's huge growth of middle class.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.160]   For them, it's not necessarily about water and diarrhea.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.960]   It's also about economic opportunity.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.080]   It's also about education.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.160]   It's about information.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.960]   It's about informed societies.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.080]   Those are also good goals to have.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.560]   And Bill's doing very good work and I support the work he's doing.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   He's doing wonderful things.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.520]   And Mark and Sergey can do some stuff too.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.520]   It wouldn't, it wouldn't hurt.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520]   And you know, I live in California.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520]   My kid had diarrhea.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   I googled it.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   I mean, you know, it doesn't work.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520]   It does work.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]   The internet.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:53.120]   It's amazing to me how much I've googled things about infant care in the first 10 months.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120]   My daughter's life.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.920]   I was watching YouTube videos and had a spongebait, a newborn, her first week.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.320]   You know what happens by the way when you do that.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.520]   So Henry, who my son, who's now going to college, we mentioned that and just turned
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.120]   18, he got, you know, the selective service thing.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.360]   I figured, well, there's probably laws in school, has to reveal that.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.440]   Then he got a razor from Gillette.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.520]   And he said, how did Gillette know how to send to send me a razor?
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.120]   And I said, well, you know, probably the hospital, the social baby records and they've
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.320]   been keeping track for 18 years.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.960]   Well, the kind of marketing that goes on college campuses is really insane.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.920]   And just, you know, maybe they've bought it from the college or maybe I googled a few
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.520]   too many times, razor burn.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.280]   I mean, who knows, right?
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.080]   But so that information's out there.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.640]   And it does yield some interesting results.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   But it is good.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.200]   The web is good, no matter what you say.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.760]   Because of all that porn.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   It's all for porn.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.960]   Well, unless people have been totally anonymous and private.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:12.600]   Let us get, let us get from Gina, Trippani, a tip of some kind, our tip of the week.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.960]   The latest stable version of Chrome, Chrome version 29, has a, has a new little setting
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960]   I thought was caught my eye.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   It was a little, a little interesting.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.840]   Because sometimes I go a little extension crazy in Chrome.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]   Yes.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.680]   But if you go into settings and then advanced settings, there's a new button which will
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.720]   reset Chrome basically to its, to its, its original state.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.720]   Ooh.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.320]   It will, it'll restore your watch.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.040]   It won't affect your bookmarks, your save passwords or your history.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:48.280]   But it will delete, it will, it will disable all your, all your extensions.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.640]   It will unpin tabs.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.520]   It will also like reset your homepage and your new tab page and your search engine.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.920]   It will clear, it'll clear things up.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.160]   It'll give you that new, new car smell in Chrome.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.280]   So to use it, if you're, if you're interested in doing it, and actually I just did it on
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.000]   this machine because I like to keep this machine relatively clean, you can go to the,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.880]   the hamburger icon in the top right on Chrome and go to settings, advanced settings, and
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.760]   then there's a reset browser settings button.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.560]   And that'll just clean everything up, disable all your extensions, get everything back to
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.320]   kind of factory settings without messing with your, your bookmarks, your history or your
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   save passwords.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.720]   A nice way to reset the browser if you've gone to extension crazy or things have gotten
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.600]   slow or you just kind of want to, you know, something's gotten wonky and you just want
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.200]   to reset it back to the, the default without the leading everything.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.200]   There you go.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.200]   There you go.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.920]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week?
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.760]   Well, so I'm going to go back to my downer topic of course at the NSA and all that.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.120]   And I just saw the, the, the finally, the government released the FISA decision from 2011
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   that said that much of what was being done was illegal.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.800]   And Christopher, uh, Segoian, is that a correct?
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.440]   Yeah, South Segoian's brother, Christopher.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.840]   The ACLU's CTO, uh, I believe is his title.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.360]   Um, one tweet that just came up because they're digging through this on page 71.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:13.720]   It says that 91% of internet communications acquired by NSA, BSS section 702 are direct
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.200]   from internet service providers, not backbone taps.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200]   So your ISP ain't your friend.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.840]   No, they're your neighborhood spot.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.840]   It's saying this for years.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.920]   People worry so much about Google.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.680]   There's one, there's one guy who sees everything before Google does.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   That's your ISP.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.640]   Not just everything you do on Google, everything you do everywhere.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   And that hasn't come out.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.600]   There's been no discussion of the ISPs at all.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   And there needs to be.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.400]   Well, we have discussed it quite a bit.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.400]   Yes.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.360]   Uh, you know, of course, car, remember, carniv, yes, Steve, but in general, remember we talked
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.560]   about carnivore when the FBI was trying to put a box in all internet service providers
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.040]   that would save 18 months worth of data.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.920]   That's, you know, pretty much being done now under a different name.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.840]   And we also talk about my good friend, uh, Dane Jasper, who runs sonic net, which is a
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:05.480]   independent internet service provider, which has for years fought this and refuses to do
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.480]   that.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.680]   And they're the exception that proves the rule as far as I'm concerned.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.280]   That's the only one we're hearing from.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.800]   The other great thing you've had on the network, I think it was this last week, Father Robert
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:20.400]   showed a, uh, a, a, a tap for, um, uh, fiber.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.920]   And how you can do that, it showed the physical tap, how you do it.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920]   So easy.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   So easy.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   Easy, easy, easy.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.560]   Danny, did you want to share a tip or anything, a tool, a number?
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.080]   Um, what do you like, man?
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.080]   What do you like?
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   I don't know.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.660]   You know, I, I do a column on C net every so often, like once a week on, it's the
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.660]   common sense tech column.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.880]   And I, maybe I'll just share two things I did there.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:49.080]   I went on my trip and one of the columns I wrote when I came back was if, you know,
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.800]   if you don't know about it, you know, the idea of just going local with your SIM card.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.640]   Um, if you've got an unlocked phone, it's pretty easy in a lot of countries.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.640]   I like it Heathrow.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:02.920]   I got off the plane, walked over to vending machine, uh, got a local SIM card and the
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.480]   way I love that column.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480]   What's that?
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.240]   I love that column of yours was great.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.340]   I've not seen the vending machine.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.340]   I would kill for that.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:11.340]   It's, it's really nice.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:15.240]   And I mean, it was like basically about $30 that I paid and then I had unlimited internet
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.720]   access and 3000 minutes and 300 or 3000 text message, 300 minutes.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.720]   And, and it's great.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.820]   And you're wired up and you're not paying all these charges to your local thing or whatever.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.920]   So I, you know, I'd encourage people to think, Hey, you can, you can go local with stuff and
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.160]   but you only do that if you have an unlocked phone.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.120]   You have to have an locked phone, but it's not as hard to unlock some of the phones as
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120]   you think.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.080]   Like you've got an older phone and you still kept it around.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.660]   You know, you're going to have an 18 T one lock it as we talked about.
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:46.460]   I unlocked two, a Samsung S four and a Samsung S three just by Googling it, finding the code,
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.300]   typing it in and the way I went.
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.860]   It was pretty slick and it worked.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:53.420]   So yeah, but yeah, you got to have the unlock phone, although the vending machine will sell
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.300]   you an lock phone if you need one.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:59.140]   But it's nice, you know, if you're going, especially if you travel around a lot and you
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.140]   probably pick these things up once you get going, but there's, there's no need to be
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.140]   tied in that way.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:05.860]   If you, if you don't want to be unplugged.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.840]   And the other thing was just my following column that came up after that was now that I got
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   back from the trip.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.920]   I was like, time to organize all my photos.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.920]   And I don't have a good tip there.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.440]   I, I just sort of was expressing pain points on how all our photos are going.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.080]   And there's so many photos that are out there that I just feel like I want to throw up my
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.320]   hands and give up.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.760]   But instead I'm kind of redoubling my efforts to dive into this stuff and I'm going to try
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.760]   to explore it a bit more and how to maybe make your photos more manageable and I'm going
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.720]   to, I'm going to, I'll help you with that one.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:38.260]   This is a third party service, but it's a great service called ever picks.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.260]   E-V-E-R.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.260]   I've been using that.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:42.700]   And that's one of the things I'm exploring.
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:49.060]   Although see the problem I run into with ever picks is Mac, but not Android, right?
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:52.100]   Well, here's, here's the thing that I'm doing now.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.940]   And you know, no surprise, LaVita Google, but on my Chromebook Pixel, this has now just
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:01.340]   been extended to others.
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.880]   I put in the SIM card in the Pixel, you can do this on other Chromebooks now.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.380]   It automatically uploads the latest photos right into Google Plus.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:12.040]   The Google Plus stuff, it does all the auto awesome.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.240]   I can very easily manage them and put them in folders, all that kind of stuff there.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.540]   I'm loving that.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.880]   The issue is for people like Danny who take pictures on a camera.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   You put the SIM card.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   Most of the SIM, you put the SD card.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.880]   Right.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:28.600]   And in fact, one of the things about the Google Plus thing that I get into in the comm was
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.240]   I really, I really love a lot of what it's doing.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.840]   And yet it is difficult that it does not automatically put things into albums and is
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.080]   generating more photos than I can even handle already.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.600]   And then I like to have my local copies, right?
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.200]   Let me tell you, getting the stuff out of Google Plus is not as easy as you might think
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.840]   because you either do a Google takeout and when I look to try to do it, it was like a
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:56.400]   16 gigabyte file, which is a lot to try to download at once.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.000]   Or you got to go through 500 photos at a time.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.920]   Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.800]   tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.440]   So I'm really hopeful that they'll evolve that service because I think it's the closest
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   of these.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.360]   One of the things I'm realizing is I really feel like you need a solution that automatically
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.680]   does the upload out of your phones because we take so much out of it.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.320]   But I also want some kind of a system where when I sync my stuff and I put them into
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:25.880]   albums, if I ever want to go into something else, all that stuff does not get locked behind
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.400]   and I don't have the answers to all that yet.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.760]   I think you should continue looking at Everpix.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.560]   I know it doesn't have a plug-in for Android phones, but it does Picasso well about web
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.200]   albums.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.520]   It does Facebook, it does Instagram, it does Twitter, it does Flickr.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   You can have autumn.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.520]   It's nice.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.200]   Sorry, it has this picture life.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.200]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.040]   And the other benefit that I really like is you're uploading full resolution pictures.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.320]   It then gives you a very quick and fast way to review it.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.600]   It has flashback, which I love, which is your pictures from this day in history.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.720]   And since I've uploaded all my pictures, I have 40 or 50,000 pictures on here.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.440]   I have a very nice album of stuff going back throughout my history.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.280]   I think Everpix, it's not free.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.120]   I think it's 50 bucks a year or something like that.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.240]   Is a very interesting solution.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:21.920]   This is created by the guy, we had him on triangulation who wrote, who worked for Cool
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:28.520]   Iris, which eventually became the Google Gallery, the Android Gallery.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.040]   And he also worked on another project that you might recognize, and I can't remember
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.200]   the name of it.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.080]   But this is, I think, applying a lot of intelligence.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.400]   They dedupe.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.960]   You can go back through years.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.920]   I can go back to my oldest photos and see them year by year.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.640]   I think there's a lot to be said for this.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.560]   I've been definitely playing with it more.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.680]   In fact, one of the things I, and picture life is a very similar service that is more
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.080]   expensive, but it has a few more things like you can handle Android as well.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:04.400]   But part of me, what I'm hoping is that they could somehow, like if Everpix, I wish it could
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.760]   just talk directly to Google.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.400]   I think I bet you that happens.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400]   I really do.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.160]   You know, look at the services that they support.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.600]   It's a pretty good, including Picasa Web.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.040]   Now I think that's the first step in Google and Gmail, by the way.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.280]   But I'm also wanting to have a service that when I put everything, because I want to come
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.640]   back and if I do put stuff, well, I wanted to actually either smart put things into albums
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.640]   and actually work.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.120]   That's part of what the highlighting stuff tends to do.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.880]   If I add to it a little bit, that'd be great.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.040]   But I just don't want to be locked into anything.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040]   Because years ago, I had Photoshop elements.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.800]   I used to look and eyes everything.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.160]   And then it was like five years wasted.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   Not going anywhere.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.440]   Yeah, I use Lightroom.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.560]   This also will pick up all my pictures from Lightroom.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.920]   Pretty much everything, every picture I've taken is in here.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.680]   And they organize by geo locations as well as date.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.680]   I agree.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   It's a real problem.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.600]   This is the closest thing I've seen to a solution for that.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.080]   And I take a lot of pictures.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.440]   I'll definitely keep exploring.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.360]   Yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.600]   I got out of it and then I realized I was kind of, you know, I needed something.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.160]   I have a very simple tool that was going to waste more time than you ever thought possible.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.080]   So we're suffering a little iPhone iPad envy because of the great Lauren Bricters dots game.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.080]   Good news.
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   It's now out on Android.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.560]   You can thank me or curse me later.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:33.160]   Oh, one of the most--
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.160]   Seriously?
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.160]   Dots.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.480]   One of the most-- it's simple, beautiful.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.560]   And Lauren is a brilliant programmer.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.360]   And it is a game that once you start playing, you're never going to ever--
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.360]   I curse you.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   Stop.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   I'm going to point.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   Oh.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.360]   I'm clicking on the end of the song.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.920]   Did I say the wrong person?
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:53.920]   It's not Lauren Bricter.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:54.920]   Who is it?
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.360]   It's-- isn't it Lauren?
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   Who did this?
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.360]   It's not Lauren.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   Who did dots anyway?
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.360]   Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.360]   The arrangement puzzle.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.600]   It's a very famous Mac programmer who's, I guess, hired somebody to do it for Android, but
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600]   it's a perfect port.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   Perfect port.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.440]   And as perfect as the game out by connecting the dots, which of course is what we're talking
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.440]   about with you.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440]   Yes, connect your dots.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.200]   Here's a tap a tiny tune.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.200]   It's a beta works.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.200]   Is it beta works?
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.200]   I don't know.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.200]   Oh, I think it might be--
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.920]   Didn't beta works?
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.920]   Did they acquire it?
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920]   Yes.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920]   Yes.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920]   I think so.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   All right.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   It was a hurt people curse beta works over this.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.920]   Yes.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.520]   This is one of those things I was like, oh, don't really work in a device that has game
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.720]   center every day.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.920]   It's bejeweled, but it with some really nice additional things that make it super, super
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.920]   fun.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.680]   It's a perfect casual game because you can play it for, you know, it's just quick and
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.000]   easy and no stress.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.160]   No candy.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   No candy.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   It's better.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.280]   If you're on a candy crush, get off the candy crush and start playing dots.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.440]   And it makes a nice sound.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.680]   I actually really am pleased to see what a perfect port it is.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.000]   Letterpress was Lauren's game.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   I-- beta works.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   Okay.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.720]   I was thinking of letterpress was Lauren Bricter.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.120]   Beta works for this one.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:17.160]   Let's watch out, put it on the front page.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160]   You'll be playing it.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.760]   Hey, I want to thank you guys for being here.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.360]   It's so fun to do this show.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.240]   Jeff, I hope your shoulder feels better.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.240]   Jeff Jarvis is a--
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.240]   Thank you.

[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.240]   You're playing dots, excuse me.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.240]   I'm--
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.240]   Sorry.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.240]   Didn't mean to distract you.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:35.000]   He is also the author of Public Parts and what would Google do?
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.320]   And Gutenberg the Geek.

[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.800]   I didn't realize you were doing that CNET post.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:49.800]   That's great.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   That's fun.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   There's a lot of stuff in here.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   This is wonderful.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.800]   Yeah, it's a really good column.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.200]   Common sense tech at CNET.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.040]   Love it.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.200]   Thank you so much for being here, Danny.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.200]   You're one of the best commentators in space.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.200]   Great to have you, Danny.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.200]   Yeah, good to have you, Danny.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.200]   Thank you very much.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.520]   And of course, we're so glad that Gina's back this week.

[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.920]   The most important thing.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.440]   It's the most important thing.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.840]   All about Android every Tuesday night.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.840]   Thank you very much, all of you.
