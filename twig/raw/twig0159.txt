[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   It's time for this weekend Google. Is it possible to make a better Twitter?
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.500]   We'll talk to Dalton Caldwell, the creator of App.net.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300]   He just raised $700,000 to do just that.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300]   Twig is next.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.600]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   From people you trust.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.100]   This is Twig.

[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers of the Google, the cloud, the Twitter, the whole thing.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.500]   In fact, we'll see in a minute we're going to talk about a brand new kind of response to Twitter.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   Before we do that, let me introduce our panelists starting to my left, Gina Troppani.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500]   You've smarted where you're going to work.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.000]   Howdy.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Gina, I'm going to have you.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.500]   What's up?
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Great to be here.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   How's the meatballs?
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   Oh, good.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   Good.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500]   I got a meat on the batch.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   I meant to send you an email.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   I want that recipe.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   I'll send you the recipe.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   I was craving Grandma Troppani's meatballs.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.160]   Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.440]   No, no, no, no, poor me.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.380]   How could I say grandma also with this known a jar of it, no, no prematurely, bright.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.140]   Buzz machine.com and the author of a great book called, well, first, what would Google
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.340]   do, which you should read that?
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.460]   But also the new book is public parts and also with this Kevin Marks from his backyard.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.940]   Kevin currently works at Salesforce, but he's also the host of television.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   We always see him at home.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.220]   Yeah, you don't really work there.
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220]   You don't really do it.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.220]   I work from home.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.940]   But yeah, Google has the same problem.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.380]   When you know the Google thing that decides when you're working when you're at home, it
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.940]   thinks I work at the train station.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.940]   I swipe up on here and it says distance to work.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.140]   Oh yeah, that's a funny thing in Google now.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.740]   It does kind of make these decisions about where you think you're going.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.620]   It decides my work is the train station.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.260]   That's very funny.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.100]   Yeah, we talked a little bit about this on Twitch, certainly.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.860]   I believe we talked a little bit about it last week on Twig.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.500]   Dalton Caldwell, who is a very interesting fellow, started iMIM, then went on after selling
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.900]   iMIM to create pick, please, which unfortunately a few months before this thing called Instagram
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.660]   came along and then pivoted into something called app.net, which was a marketing tool
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.820]   for people making apps, and has pivoted again to something very interesting and it all
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.820]   started with a blog post.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.660]   Let's welcome Dalton Caldwell for just the first segment of the show.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660]   Hi, Dalton.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.660]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.340]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.660]   It's pretty short notice, but here I am.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.660]   Yeah, like none at all.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.220]   We're talking about app.net and we said, well, I wonder if Dalton's around.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.700]   I'm sitting here getting my slides ready for an Airbnb tech talk tonight.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700]   Awesome.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   Awesome.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.220]   How did this all start?
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.020]   It started with a blog post, I gather.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.500]   Yeah, sorry about the sirens.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.180]   I'm right next to a fire station.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.780]   It'll pass in a second.
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.780]   It's fine.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780]   We can hear you.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.420]   So it started with my blog posts, what Twitter could have been, which I wrote for my own
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.420]   purposes.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.500]   It was not meant to start any project.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.620]   It was not meant to be what it became.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.980]   It was just some-- it was four paragraphs that I threw together on a Sunday.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.740]   My point was that I didn't get Twitter for about two years at all as a user.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.240]   One of my programmer friends explained to me that it was actually an API and that I
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.100]   shouldn't worry too much about what the UI does.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.020]   I should think more about what you can build with the API.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.620]   The second I got that, I became a huge fan of it and completely changed my mind about
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.860]   what it was.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.580]   And that over time, as they've moved away from being the open API platform kind of company,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.220]   I think that a lot of potential was lost.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.180]   And that it's still a really great company and still a really cool company and I admire
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.700]   what they're doing and what it's for.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:12.260]   There was a hole in the market that was created when they chose to kind of shut down the API
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.860]   and that I really wish as a developer that this product existed.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.220]   And my thesis is that if they would have stayed building kind of an open API company,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.500]   the ecosystem would have been more powerful than what we currently have at the Facebook
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.660]   open graph ecosystem, which is arguably the largest social platform we have as developers
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.660]   right now.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.500]   You wrote in the blog post that as you understood a hugely divisive internal debate occurred
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.580]   among Twitter employees, one camp wanted to build the business around their real-time
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.260]   API and effect be a kind of a dial tone for our messaging system for the internet.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.780]   In this scenario, Twitter would have turned into something like a real-time cloud API
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780]   company.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.980]   The other camp looked at Google's advertising model for inspiration, decided their own version
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.500]   of AdWords would be the right way to go.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.940]   And obviously that second group won.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.940]   Yes.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.740]   But now Twitter is going to do a TV show.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.460]   They've got ads if you watched during the Olympics.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.340]   I mean, it really has become an ad-supported system.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.260]   But what's wrong with that, Don?
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.500]   I mean, nothing's wrong with it.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.100]   It's their prerogative to do so.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.220]   And I think a lot of people misconstrued my critiques is that of saying that what they're
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.220]   doing is wrong.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.100]   They're bad and they shouldn't be around.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.260]   That is not the basis of my critiques.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.700]   The basis of my critiques is that as an app developer, shutting down the ecosystem isn't
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   great.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.820]   And I would have been building more Twitter stuff myself if I had more confidence that
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:47.020]   the platform would have stayed stable and that developers need a social platform to
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   build on.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.700]   We need this to build good software.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.100]   And if Twitter's saying it can't be it, well, that's not great.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.100]   That's too bad.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.580]   We need to find something else.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.660]   Yeah, we envisioned, I think, a whole world of automatic Twitter bots doing everything
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.220]   from telling us what's going on in the weather to what's going on in the world series.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.540]   Even just this whole thing of this messaging system.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.340]   So you did a little pivot.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.900]   You said, well, maybe I could use app.net.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.020]   And you created-- you set up a page, join.app.net.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.100]   What was your idea?
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.380]   So the idea here was I wasn't sure what I was going to do.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:34.260]   Again, to be transparent, I was weighing whether to sell the company and just go work at a
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.260]   big company.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.980]   And I've been public about that.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.100]   And I decided that I really--
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.940]   That was also a very good post.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   I decided that--
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   The Facebook post?
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   That was great.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.420]   I decided that I didn't really want to sell the company and that it would be a shame to
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   just go be it-- sell the company at this point in time.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:06.780]   And that what I really wanted to do was just go for it and try to build the world that
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.780]   I want to see.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.620]   And again, to be transparent with you guys, I had just come from food camp.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.100]   And that's-- Jean was there.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   We didn't talk.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.260]   I was hugely inspired by a lot of the sessions at Food Camp about the Open Web and about
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.740]   some of the mistakes that were made when trying to build our social platforms.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.980]   And so I kind of walked away from it with this idea that we all created the social web
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.980]   in the past 10 years.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.500]   A lot of people that I was in the room at Food Camp with helped create this stuff.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.220]   And that it's not like we just wipe up our hands and say, it's all done.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.740]   This is the best that it can be.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.740]   And then actually, there's a room for people to try new approaches and that we shouldn't
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.260]   just give up and assume that we're stuck with what we're stuck with.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.260]   And that was very much my mentality coming out of Food Camp and what inspired me to be
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.220]   crazy enough to do this.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.860]   So that's what was going on in my head is, do I really want to sell the company right
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.860]   now?
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.500]   Or do I want to try to be as optimistic as possible and rethink the assumptions we've
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.780]   made about the social web?
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.580]   Why did Evan Prodromo did Identica, which is now a status net, with kind of a similar
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:27.220]   idea, free open source, federated internet messaging system, you're not open in the
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.540]   sense that you're not open source, you're open in the sense that the APIs are open.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.780]   And the real key to this was that it would be a paid service.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   That's correct.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:43.820]   If you know my backgrounds, I fought the digital music industry for 10 years.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.180]   And if you Google me, you'll see that I got sued by the music industry and negotiated
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.860]   and settled and did licensing deals in the music industry and that dealing with copyright
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.420]   and media companies was what most of my career thus far has been about.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.180]   And my takeaway from that was that actually the people in the music industry are actually
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.340]   good people.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.020]   And I think people don't give them enough credit that they are good people that want
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.260]   to do the right thing.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260]   It's just that the business models of the music industry are predicated on controlling
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.780]   content.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.660]   And once you have a media business model that's predicated on controlling content, you're
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.420]   going to end up making choices that consistently lock down access to the content by third parties.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.500]   And so in a paid services model, you are providing infrastructure that pushes bits
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.220]   through the service and you're not really interested in trying to control them.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.740]   You're not interested in trying to see what's inside the packets and manipulate what's inside
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.740]   them.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.060]   You're just providing a service to your customer.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.580]   Kind of like like pin board is doing where I kind of like the idea of saying this is
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:55.060]   a business and it's that old that old meta filter meme if you're not paying for it, you're
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.060]   the product.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.500]   So the idea here is the product is the product.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.380]   You get to do what you want with it.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.780]   There's a third model though, isn't there?
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:08.380]   Which was talked about after you released Elton of starting this truly open source out there
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.700]   and it's federated and that no one controls it.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.300]   No one owns it.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.940]   Obviously, there's a cost problem there.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.580]   But you start something like that's truly open and or even like for that matter WordPress
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.940]   that's on an open source platform and then they build a commercial company upon it and
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.100]   others can build a company upon it.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   So there's a third model there.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.260]   Did you consider that model too?
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.260]   Sure.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.580]   Again, to be very honest, that is a totally valid model and people have been working at
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.580]   it for a while.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.420]   Some of the people I talked to at through camp were people that have been trying to build
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   this.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.900]   That's where I met the co-creator of Pub/SubHubbub and we spent a lot of time talking about it.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.940]   And again, I want to make clear that I hope people build exactly those kinds of things
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.660]   and I don't have this idea that we're going to be all things to all people and solve for
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.980]   everything.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.620]   My model for this business is actually GitHub where Git is open source and GPL and anyone
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.380]   can use it and install it on their own server.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.980]   But GitHub is a company and it's a for-profit company and it's actually really useful that
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.900]   it's operated as a hosting service.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900]   No one is forced to use GitHub that does not want to use GitHub, you know, you just run
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.340]   it on your service on your own servers, excuse me.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.340]   But if you choose to use GitHub, there's a lot of advantages of having this hosted service,
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.900]   of having them innovate on features, of having to not worry about keeping the site up, etc,
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.900]   etc.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.580]   And similarly Dropbox, anyone could roll their own Dropbox using RSync.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.660]   You would set up an AWS instance, set up RSync, download some code and you could kind of roll
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.580]   your own Dropbox and I'm sure a lot of people do so.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.300]   But I think it's ultimately good whether or not you use it or not that a service like
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.660]   Dropbox exists, that that company exists.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.860]   So that's kind of where I see this business fitting in the model is that we are not going
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.020]   to be a solution to the things that Jeff just talked about.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:10.540]   But I see this as a piece of the infrastructure that it's better to have exist than not.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.780]   Does that make sense, Jeff?
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.860]   Yeah, I'm also curious to get you and Gina going because I'm quizzed Gina often every
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:21.180]   time the Twig, I mean Twitter, sorry, we're Twig, the Twitter pulled back and said no
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.900]   developers, we want to do this now.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.740]   And I said, how can you still develop with that in that environment?
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.820]   And Gina says, well, this is part of the risk and so on and so forth.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.180]   I don't want to speak for you, Gina.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:37.100]   But I'd be curious to hear you two and your viewpoints on especially the Twitter ecosystem.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.820]   You know, I had to say like I didn't, I was pretty skeptical about app.net.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.140]   I signed up as a developer.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.180]   I didn't think it would get funded and it did.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.260]   So I'm really thrilled that Dalton is proving me wrong because I was at the session, the
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.020]   open web session that he was at at food camp and I really believe in the principles behind
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.180]   app.net.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.300]   As a developer, I always try to go to where the people are.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.100]   And I guess my kind of question about whether or not this something like this can succeed
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:10.500]   is just getting, making the app accessible to everyone is part of that is making it free.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.580]   That's why Facebook and Twitter have gained critical mass.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.060]   And so, and there are kind of problems that get introduced when you have to, you know,
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.220]   when people have to pay 50 bucks a year to basically access something that they can get
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220]   for free otherwise.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.540]   I'm kind of looking at it from less from a principal standpoint, which I'm absolutely
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.660]   right with Dalton to a kind of more practical kind of standpoint.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.060]   Like as a developer, like I certainly want to develop for app.net, but it's, you know,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.340]   you got to get the people.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.940]   And now again, I hope Dalton proves me wrong, gets and gets a ton of people to do this.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.580]   And, you know, also, so that aside, the other thing that I think about when I look at open
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.220]   protocols, I think about AIM, you know, like AOL had this instant messenger protocol and
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.580]   it issued its own client.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.860]   And then a lot of other people built a lot of other clients.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.180]   And then there was Jabber, then there was, you know, I secure whatever.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.300]   And now we all sort of run instant messenger clients.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.460]   And I don't really know what protocol I'm talking to people over.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460]   Right.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.460]   I've just got all my buddies in a list.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   And so I'm wondering if-
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.460]   Well, that's the sort of second version of it.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.580]   I mean, the first version was when people were trying to reverse-engine them, there was
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.580]   a huge fight.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.460]   Microsoft and AOL were having protocol change fights.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.620]   Microsoft was trying to write an interoperating client and AIM kept changing it.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.660]   And one of the reasons that the Jabber protocol went out was because the people could build
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.860]   multi-clients for an eventually AIM, after AIM licensed it to Apple for iChapp, they
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.700]   got a bit more relaxed about it.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   Right.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.580]   So in this kind of situation, like an app.net open protocol, are we envisioning that lots
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.940]   of different companies will be able to run app.net types?
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.100]   Is that the idea?
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.860]   How do you preserve the openness and have a closed source?
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.300]   Well, that's where the Popsabhava activity streams, etc.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.660]   Yeah, so we've stayed as Blob comes in, right?
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.580]   So we've stayed as support for all of those.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.860]   And again, because I was at Flu and I made friends with co-creator Popsabhava, very familiar
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.740]   with the thinking behind these open standards.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:14.180]   And the fact that I was even invited to Food hopefully shows that I'm on team open standards.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:21.020]   And so my belief is that the back end hosted infrastructure may or may not be open sourced
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.020]   in the future.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.900]   I'm not going to promise it yet.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.260]   And there's a bunch of reasons why GitHub itself is an open source, meaning the code
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   that they write.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:35.540]   But at the very least, if the protocol is always open, there can be infinite implementations.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.180]   And I'm fully aware that new implementations and competitive services, what we're doing
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.380]   will be built.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:47.060]   I say this in some of my blog posts that this is not necessarily going to be a huge company.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.540]   But that's okay, right?
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   It's...
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.540]   So they'll all interoperate?
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.220]   Well, that's what's interesting, I guess, because it uses standards.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.460]   You don't need to federate.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   There's just...
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.260]   You're just an implementation of a standard.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.020]   Is that right?
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.420]   That is federation, as I understand.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.340]   That's a better way to do it, really.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.700]   If you didn't publish the power of right, then you end up with federation.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.060]   And one of the reasons that it was very hard to get Twitter and Facebook to adopt that
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.860]   is that their worldview was there at the center of the world, and they didn't see federation
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.860]   as a goal.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.420]   They look at the protocol and say, "This is inefficient for what we do."
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.180]   And it may be, with all due respect, why status net has not taken off, because although
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.300]   it's federatable, you have to run status net on your server.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   Yes.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.060]   No, this is the problem Gina and I were talking about as well, where the challenge is getting
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.660]   stuff running on a server is hard.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.660]   Yep.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   Gina has the stuff that she's building.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.660]   With think up.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.660]   Yep.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.660]   Think up.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.660]   Yeah, and that's something...
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   We need to make that easier.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.300]   There are things that make that a little easier, including, you know, it's a parochu that the
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.460]   company I work for hosts.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.660]   It makes it easier to redeploy things, but it's still not trivial.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   And that isn't an issue.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.460]   To be able to get stuff running in the cloud is still hard.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.460]   Sure.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.460]   What I would do is...
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.020]   I mean, so a couple of them are energy.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.420]   So GitHub is slightly different, because GitHub has a business model that is, if your
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.380]   stuff is public, it's free.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.620]   If it's private, you have to pay.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.420]   And that may be a model that would suit...
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.340]   In fact, that's what status net has done.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.900]   That they have a model that's very like that, which is if you want to do public stuff, they
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.940]   will host stuff for you.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940]   You can have the source.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:23.540]   If you want to do an in-house activity stream, then they will sell you services to do that.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.540]   So status net is in some ways close to GitHub than you are.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.060]   You have a different model that's more like a classic hosting model.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.420]   So we should explain that...
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:37.380]   What Dalton did was a Kickstarter style fundraising drive that said, if you want to be in app.net,
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.660]   you can join for $50.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.820]   If you wanted to be a developer, you could join for $100.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.980]   This is per year.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.860]   And you said, I could fund this myself, but I think it's better to see if there's interest.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.020]   And you raised how much money, Dalton?
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.260]   I think it closed at $12,000 and changed backers and $803,000.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.860]   Hold on, I took it.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.860]   I took a screenshot of it and it's posted up there.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.780]   Can I talk about the free thing real quick?
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   Yes.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.780]   Is that okay?
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:15.460]   So, look, do you remember what Twitter looked like the day it launched with the green logo?
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460]   Yes.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.820]   I didn't see it too much.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.820]   Too late up.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.820]   You should look it up.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.820]   It's pretty funny.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.820]   It's ugly as hell.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.820]   I got it right here.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   So, and it's missing an E.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.820]   Yeah, they spelled it differently.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.820]   And did I?
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.140]   The day Twitter launched, that's what it looked like.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:37.820]   And what I want people to understand is that this is a long play.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.140]   Good for you.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.140]   Good for you.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:47.060]   We want something that's sustainable financially, any short to medium term.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.700]   And that's very important to us because if we're not sustainable financially, then it'd
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.180]   be very difficult for me to stay with a straight face that this is something dependable that
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.900]   people could build on.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.620]   Like that's, that kind of transparency is very important to me.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.940]   Additionally, we don't want it to grow too big too fast because we want to make sure
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.580]   we can scale the technology behind the service.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.940]   The worst thing we can do is all of a sudden we start fail-wailing all the time because
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.660]   we're overwhelmed with new users signing up and they're disappointed.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:23.900]   Thirdly, one of the things that DiP Costello said on stage, as I recall, and I could try
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   to find that quote back up.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:31.820]   Last Twitter is, "Hey, if we were going to be an API company, we would have just launched
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.420]   with all third party apps."
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   I don't know.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.900]   I think it was in the Fred Wilson post.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.340]   I'll find a link to that.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:43.580]   But his point was they were already so far along that the idea of maintaining third party
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.340]   apps, it was too late in the game to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.300]   Fred, Fred earlier, just to remember what's going on, Fred earlier had said, "When I complained
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.020]   about some Twitter functionality," he said, "That's what the outside apps and developers
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.020]   are for, Jeff."
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   Yeah, too bad.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.420]   So they're gone.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.340]   What joined on AppDone is today is we're not trying to be all things to all people.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.940]   We're not trying to appeal to all people.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.180]   In my first blog post, I discussed Paul Graham essay about how to start a new search engine.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.500]   His advice was not to build something that appeals to all people.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.260]   Rather build something that appeals to 10,000.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.340]   He calls them hackers, but what he means is Uber nerds.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.380]   Not to worry about it being too nerdy, because if you can build something that's used by
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:34.020]   10,000 Uber nerds, you're going, "That's a huge step forward to get towards something
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.820]   that would be Google scale."
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.700]   The way to think about what we're doing now vis-a-vis the pay model and vis-a-vis
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.100]   appealing to developers, et cetera, et cetera, is that we're trying to get third party developers
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.300]   to build on this as fast as possible.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.940]   In fact, we originally weren't going to build a website hosted at alpha.net at all.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.460]   We basically had to do it to prove that this wasn't vaporware.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.900]   And Paul is to nurture the third party ecosystem, and a lot of the developers in there, and
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.940]   they've already built, if you look at our GitHub page, they've already built 20 or 30
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   integrations in the past seven days since our API has been open.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.540]   That's the future of the company.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.980]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.900]   You're building half dozen iOS apps and Android and desktop.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.260]   It's really amazing.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.900]   And this is very encouraging to see this kind of response.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.340]   Yeah, that is great.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.780]   So that's the future of the service.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.660]   I would think of alpha.net as our reference implementation.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.020]   My intention is to just open source that sucker, put it on GitHub, and stop maintaining
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.140]   it at some point in the future.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.060]   It's a feature our platform could do.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.900]   It's not the service.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.380]   And so that's what we're doing.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.100]   And I understand that a lot of non-technical people have trouble understanding that, and
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.700]   they see something like a paywall, and they're reading all these conspiracy theories into
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.660]   some sort of-- I'd rouse some interesting things here.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.940]   But the idea is we're just trying to put strapper developer community, and this was
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.940]   the way to do it.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.540]   And I think it's working based on that GitHub page.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   So I'm--
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.540]   Adult Dalton?
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.260]   --sight that this is working.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.700]   Do you-- and I'm one of those not very bright people about this.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.420]   I'm going to get a sense of a long game that you have in two questions, two ways.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:24.100]   One does-- is this then-- if 10,000 geeks use it, does this become a way to pressure
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:30.620]   the Twitters, to pressure the closed systems to act differently and open up because they
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.620]   have to?
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.820]   And then the second question, a little more general, is if you look at the areas that
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.100]   kind of have worked in that pressure view, that Firefox isn't number one, doesn't have
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   to be number one.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.340]   It led to competition.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.780]   It led to, I think, Chrome to an extent as well.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.980]   And it led to a much more healthy ecosystem.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:55.020]   You know, Ditto for Apache taking away what was going to be Netscape's hegemony over
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.460]   server software, and so on and so on.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.300]   So where do you see you fitting in an ecosystem?
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.780]   Where do you want to be in that?
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:09.340]   As we see other closed systems that we grate against, what's the right model that you would
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   push others to do?
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:17.540]   And then in the end, what happens to the old closed system when there is this new pressure?
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.860]   I mean, sure.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.780]   My vision is that, again, I point to GitHub.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.100]   It's a smallish company.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.340]   I think they have 50 or 60 employees.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.180]   It's very profitable.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.380]   It seems like a really fun place to work at.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.780]   They're not trying to be all things to all people.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:42.300]   It's a smallish growing, fun place to work.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.420]   And the way my vision for this company is it's not that we're going to be building a
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.660]   new Facebook or building a new Twitter.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.420]   I think that's not at all what I'm interested in doing.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:25:00.820]   I just want to build a cool infrastructure company in the spirit of building an ISP in
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.180]   the early '90s or a BBS in the '80s or something like that.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.380]   This is an enabling technology.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.460]   And I think history will judge how compelling or useful it was based on the ecosystem of
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.220]   what developers build on top of us, not on how rich we get or how many employees we
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.020]   have or what our value is.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.020]   Right.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.940]   So I want to ask you, as we your insetience on the ecosystem?
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.100]   Oh, so I think that this will definitely have an impact.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.540]   I mean, it already has in the press.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.460]   It's clear that there's a lot of interesting PR games happening and we'll see more and
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460]   more.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:41.460]   And so us kind of making these moves have changed the tone regarding how third party
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.620]   app developers are being treated.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.780]   And I really don't know what will change.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.740]   And I think it does come down to financial incentives and business models.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.420]   And so I'm not convinced that Facebook and Twitter are going to be able to radically
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.780]   change their stance towards third party developers because it's just not in their financial
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.220]   best interest to do so.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.060]   And they have a fairly tight deadline to hit their financial numbers.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:08.340]   So I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:14.500]   So again, talking about the future, do you imagine then a world at which some point where
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.940]   you run a server, there are many, many clients that are interacting.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.820]   You may not even run a client.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.940]   You have a reference client.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.260]   That's it.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.460]   And then people pay you.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.900]   And is it going to be $50 per user is per year?
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.860]   Is that the going to be?
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.580]   So yeah, so financial stuff, I really don't know.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.380]   I'm going to talk about this in my tech talk tonight.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.060]   We've tried to just make something sustainable off a small number of users.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.860]   And as the service grows, then we have the freedom to do things like either freemium
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.340]   ask things like Dropbox or GitHub.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.820]   And again, I'm not promising those.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.740]   I'm just saying that is certainly a doable option.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.940]   And the other thing that I'm going to experiment with that I blogged about is a third party
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:06.540]   revenue share proposal where there's a mechanism by which you, the user's money, flows through
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.060]   to third party app developers.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.660]   So if you're a third party app developer, you're building on top of app.net and you're
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.620]   adding value and you're creating utility for users through your software that you're getting
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.620]   paid.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.020]   And the economics are flowing through to you.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.780]   Because again, I think that's what's great about the App Store and things like that.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   There's something downsides out there.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:34.180]   But in the day, you can make a lot of money if you build fantastic iOS software.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:40.820]   And I think that again, in my vision, third party developers add the value to things like
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.100]   Twitter and Facebook.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.140]   And so they should be getting paid.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:50.460]   And it's a complete inversion of what we're seeing now in my humble opinion.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.340]   And that's true.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.660]   You've closed it off to developers at this point.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.420]   You can't go and pay 50 bucks.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.300]   I mean, 100 bucks to be a developer at this point.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   Oh, you can.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.460]   Everyone can sign up.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:06.660]   What happened is that in the last 40 hours of the campaign, the number of backers doubled.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.820]   And so we have 6,000 alpha requests in our queue right now.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.980]   And we're working through them.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:17.420]   And again, to be transparent with you guys, we wanted to put in moderation tools because
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.860]   if we just dumped 6,000 new people in our tiny little alpha, it's going to get hairy
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.860]   really fast.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.780]   It's already happening.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.300]   So we're not trying to do some kind of conspiracy to keep people out or something.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.580]   It's just like, thank you for letting me in, Dalton.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.980]   Very happy.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:34.980]   We're human.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   We're here.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.680]   Here's our little office.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.380]   I have 300 emails in my inbox.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.100]   I have to speak in front of 300 people tonight.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.500]   We want to get everybody in.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.260]   We want everybody to be kind to each other.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.460]   We want to build our moderation tools.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.740]   We need to build our terms of service, which we're going to be sharing on GitHub to select
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.180]   feedback on.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:01.780]   The way to think about this is an alpha test to validate this is real and to spark people's
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.740]   imagination, to start building integrations on top of it.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.580]   And a couple of things on that is like, in terms of novel integrations, we spend a lot
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.100]   of time on this one GitHub issue talking about private messaging.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.220]   And I think it's the coolest thing ever.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   It's GitHub issue 33.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.580]   And the idea there is you can have the infrastructure to do something like you could implement
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:30.100]   like a group tech service like Beluga or GroupMe using the semantics in there.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.340]   You could use it for turn-based games.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.900]   You could use it to build something kind of like a Google Wave.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.980]   We're trying to build on all these semantics to do things that look nothing like the Twitter
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.180]   UI.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.140]   And that's part of the power of the API.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.900]   But again, given Google Wave, one of my big takeaways was that they made our UI try to
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.420]   do too much.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.380]   This is just as powerful as an API as Google Wave is.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.460]   But we made a really dumb, simple, easy to understand UI to show it to people so that
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.300]   people don't get spun out on it.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.100]   And again, people are freaking out because our UI looks too much like Twitter.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.900]   But I think that kind of misses the point.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.140]   That's just our attempt to make something that's easy to understand right out of the
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.140]   game.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.140]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.540]   Yeah, and that makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.260]   And that actually that's a good approach.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.100]   I have to say I'm a lot more interested in developing for app.net now that I've kind
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.700]   of-- I feel like I have kind of the fuller story.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.700]   I mean, the next 12 months or so-- so you've got a bunch of people signed up and backing
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.700]   the project.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.900]   These are obviously people who were attracted to the principles that you laid out in your
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.620]   video and that are kind of dissatisfied with the way they were being treated if they were
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.620]   developers.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.300]   So if anything, you've got a kind of fantastic developer salon of the sort of most elite early
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.780]   adopters going on community-wise.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.820]   And then you're going to have all these different apps getting built, which is great.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.700]   I'm impressed with the amount of developer activity you've had already.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.900]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.140]   This is the coolest thing that I've ever done.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.140]   It's really amazing when you hit something.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.060]   It just takes off.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:02.140]   The fact that you in just the last couple of days made your goal, it actually looked
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.780]   like you weren't going to make it.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   It did.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.900]   And I think what turned the turning point was the alpha.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.020]   And so maybe if we wouldn't have shipped it--
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.020]   Yeah, it's good you did.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.900]   You know, there were downsides to shipping the alpha.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.540]   One of the downsides was we couldn't guarantee usernames would be given.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.700]   So there's username collisions.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.420]   And so there's some folks unhappy with us that I understand.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.420]   But otherwise, we would have to restrict all alpha invites to hit the end of the username
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.620]   claim date.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.660]   So there was definitely some downsides to shipping the alpha when we did.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.100]   But at the end of the day, we called an audible.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   We did it.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.620]   And I think that's what put us over the goal.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.500]   And I guess, glad we did it.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.660]   Hey, thank you so much, Dalton.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.140]   I know you want to get back to your slides.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.140]   We're going to let you go.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   Congratulations.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.260]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.020]   And I think a lot of people do not have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.020]   But we get it.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.020]   And so we're going to explain it.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   Join.app.net.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.020]   Thank you so much.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   Appreciate it, guys.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.020]   Great to talk to you.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   Thank you.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.620]   On last minute, literally 30 seconds before the show began, we said, hey, what if we get
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.620]   Dalton?
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.020]   And he was very kind to join us, even though he's on deadline.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.540]   So maybe this is really one to go to Kevin Marks.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.100]   You know, a lot of people say, oh, it's just a gated community.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.820]   It's a $50 Twitter clone.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.820]   I don't get it.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.820]   What's the point?
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:25.620]   Obviously, and that was one of the risks of creating alpha, creating this app.net alpha,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.500]   is that it's concretized it.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.500]   But it really isn't.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   It's about standards.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.100]   So would you explain to me, Pub/Sub, Hub, Pub?
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:38.700]   Kevin, why this is really open and not just Dalton's good idea?
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.980]   Well, you know, it remains to be seen if it is really open.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.780]   That's, Dalton said he's going to do that.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.900]   And for now, we can trust him to hold him to that.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.660]   And you know, we're his customers, so he should be listening.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.140]   There's 12,000 people who will hold him to that.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.140]   Yes.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.780]   So it's the difference.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:01.020]   So this is the difference between something that is web-like, where there is an open
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.020]   standard, which means that anyone can build things interoperate and something that is
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.460]   owned by a whole company.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.380]   And we seem to have been, so blogging was like this.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.880]   Blogging ended up being something that was done by lots of companies in parallel but
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.440]   interoperated because of a primarily publishing web pages.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.920]   And then we had some other standards for moving things back and forth, RSS, Atom, and the
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.420]   various ways of sending comment stuff back and forth.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.840]   So there was some infrastructure, but it wasn't owned by anyone.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.320]   Lots of things that have been built since then do roughly the same thing, but ad features
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.840]   that only work within that environment.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.440]   Tumblr is one example.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.640]   Tumblr has a lot of nice social features, but they're restricted to Tumblr.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.800]   Twitter's another example.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.240]   Twitter has the ad mention stuff that works very nicely, but it only works inside Twitter.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   And so there's a chunk of standards that we're trying to do this in a distributed way,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.680]   some of which I worked on as part of the things that came out of OpenSocial.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:06.660]   And some of these, and we have various implementations of these, but the challenge is always with
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:18.340]   any of these things that are mass usage, you tend to converge on one or two delivery places
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.740]   for them, if you like.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.740]   And that's the inherent tension.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.460]   That's due to the network effect.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.380]   You want to be where all your friends are.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.380]   Right.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.380]   And the better answer is we have a protocol that actually makes things interoperate, but
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.900]   getting those built and actually doing that is more work than just works within your site.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:40.020]   And once you are one of these successful sites, your incentive is due less of that.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.060]   Turn yourself into a silo, which is what Twitter did.
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:53.060]   So it remains to be seen what Dalton will do, but if he lives up to his commitments, then
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:35:00.500]   what he's done is seed something that would be a more open.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   But I think, see, I'm very concrete and I think a lot of our listeners are concrete
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.220]   and are saying, "Well, okay, so what site do I use?"
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.660]   And how does the stuff I put on that site have anything to do with anything on any other
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.660]   site?
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.060]   Yeah, that's the problem is moving the stuff between sites and connecting them, and that's
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.900]   the piece that's still messy.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:25.300]   Pub/Sub/Hub/Barb is designed to do a distributed notification model, and it works so that you
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:30.340]   can post something and then anyone who subscribes that can receive the posts, whatever site
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   they happen to be on.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.060]   That's built and it works, it's been running for a few years, but the challenge is still
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.380]   hooking those up.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.620]   And the thing is, if you look at that from the point of view of Facebook or Twitter,
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.860]   it looks horribly inefficient because you're basically sending an entire set up tear down
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:51.260]   for every post, and they're moving towards these streaming worldviews where they're coupling
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.500]   streams together.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:58.780]   So from their headspace, doing that is inefficient, and they'd rather root through their systems
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.300]   that are more efficient, and they have the volume, and they say, "Oh, you guys don't
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:07.140]   understand volume," you run into that kind of conversation.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.460]   Another company that's a little bit like this is Echo, Chris Sodd, Chris Lou.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:18.140]   What they have built sounds like what Dalton was originally saying, which is an API back
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.460]   end that roots activity streams.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.900]   And what they've built, what they've been doing with that is using that for media companies
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.260]   to host conversations on their own sites, but actually couple them into the rest of the
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.260]   system.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.260]   They've been doing that fairly well on that.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.060]   So if you go to some of the TV companies, other than which TV companies they're using,
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   and you use stuff on their site, you'll be having a conversation in their world, but
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.100]   it'll also be propagating out to your Facebook and Twitter.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.420]   And that's something that they've, but their back end is running on the activity streams,
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.060]   protocol, and rooting stuff back and forth that way.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:57.340]   So there are examples of this pure API company, but their customers are other companies.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.780]   What Dalton's trying to do is get customers that are individuals.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   Now that's interesting.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.420]   You guys are doing a rishi right, Gina, but the stuff you're trying to do.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.020]   Yeah, I mean, you know, it's interesting.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.620]   What I like about his Dalton's approach, that this idea that you're starting very, very
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.340]   small so that you don't scale immediately and fail well everywhere.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.500]   I mean, if you think about the way that Facebook started, it started on the Harvard campus,
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.500]   right?
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.620]   It's not Facebook unless you're at Harvard.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.220]   And that's part of the reason why Facebook got really good early and then they scaled,
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.820]   then they went to other campuses and then other campuses and then it opened up to everyone.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.060]   So I think that that's a really smart move in his part.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.820]   I mean, I think the question, I mean, he's basing this idea is like, he's started this
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.500]   very small service with 12,000, you know, kind of let's say elite developers who are
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.540]   rich enough to throw 50 bucks or 100 bucks at a social service that no one's on yet.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.820]   So these are pretty privileged people with disposable income who are very deep in attack.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.820]   Let's just be honest.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.940]   So he's starting it with that and he's saying, okay, now I expect the developers are going
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.700]   to show up and build clients that are going to make the service.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:02.740]   So he's basing it on this idea that developers made Twitter what it is.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.180]   That's one of his premises.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.380]   And it's exactly the thing Twitter's turned its back on.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.620]   I mean, but it's a question.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.100]   Do we?
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.900]   I don't know if I completely believe that developers made Twitter what it is today.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.380]   I think that developers contributed a lot to Twitter and made some great clients and
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.060]   developers listened to the way that users were using Twitter with @replies and hashtags
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.460]   that implemented those features in their clients a lot faster than Twitter did because Twitter
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.980]   was just struggling to stay up.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.060]   But I don't know if we can argue that Twitter developers kind of made Twitter what it is
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   today.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.260]   You know, is Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber using Twitter?
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.100]   That might be more important, yeah.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.340]   They drive a lot of the traffic, you know, because of client developers, I'm not sure.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.580]   So I mean, Dalton's, you know, he's making a bet.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.940]   He's saying developers are going to show up.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.340]   They're going to make such compelling clients that people are going to say, you know, this
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.620]   is just better than my other options.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.260]   I want to start using it.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.340]   I mean, I want to see him do it.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.420]   I want to see him succeed.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.060]   But he's taken a huge risk and I have a lot of respect for that.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.020]   Well, with all due respect, we're taking the risk.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.740]   Well, he's doing OK.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.740]   He's here.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.740]   We put a lot of money into this.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.340]   He's sitting with a lot of money.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   12,000.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   To be fair, he hasn't actually cast all the checks yet.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.420]   He's got a bunch of problems.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.420]   That's right.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.700]   You don't-- the money doesn't go into his account until you have an account.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.540]   And so actually, he's only got, you know, a small fraction of the total.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:29.940]   But you know, and the reason I put in a hundred bucks, Gina, is because for years I've said,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.740]   Twitter is not what it could have been, this exact thing.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.100]   And it may end up being something like this has no really front-facing user interface.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.220]   Maybe that-- I mean, Twitter could have empowered the Internet of Things as much as anything
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.220]   else, right?
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.540]   Twitter could have been a lot of different things.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.620]   But once you have to be in ad supported service, the Internet of Things is not good for you.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.860]   It just uses bandwidth for no good reason.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.300]   Well, no, I don't really agree with that.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:05.100]   I think that if you depend upon this service to bring your stuff, Google brings you now
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   transit schedules.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.460]   That's just kind of an Internet of buses and things.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.780]   But there's value to that.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.300]   As long as there's value to that, as long as you're there reliably as a result and engaged
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   and it no, there's value.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.780]   Well, but, you know, okay.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.420]   And by the way, there's a big story about that as well because all of the-- there's
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:28.620]   a whole issue with these Metropolitan Transit Services pulling back their data because they
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.740]   decide that they want their app.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.740]   They don't want people--
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.700]   This just happened in New Jersey with New Jersey Transit for-- if you stand in line for
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.660]   a New Jersey Transit train, you never know what the track is.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.060]   And there's this horrible cattle call.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.660]   So he just got the predictable tracks beforehand, published that so you could go stand by the
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.660]   right track and then J Transit cut them off.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.100]   And I'm going to give you his name in a second and we're considering-- the NJ News co-op
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.180]   is looking into whether there's legal help available because it's public information.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   By the way.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   But go ahead.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   Yeah, but this is not the first time it's happened.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:05.300]   It's one of the reasons that transit directions are missing from the Apple app is because these
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.140]   companies want to do their own app even though they are.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.300]   It is public information.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.740]   We pay-- taxpayers pay for it.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.860]   But that's the world we live in.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.180]   And I think that-- I really think that that's what's interesting about what Dalton's saying.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:26.820]   Even though he's a for-profit service, it's in service of the idea of a unmediated channel
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:27.820]   of creating--
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.820]   somebody's got to pay for it.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.940]   So I like-- I don't mind paying for services.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.100]   I use Pinboard as an example.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.180]   It's a bookmarking service.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.180]   And the amount that it costs to pay for a year of Pinboard depends on the number of users
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.700]   and the more users the less it costs because he's covering his costs.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.060]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.060]   I don't think--
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.140]   Right, but Leo, he also-- the argument is-- and I still hold out hope for ad support
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.540]   because I have to because that's how, you know, in general it's going to make money
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.780]   and we're going to have more media and how I want to keep things from going behind paywalls
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.700]   the whole world so it becomes a real issue of whether people have access to content
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.700]   and services.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.100]   So I don't think that-- and Dalton never said this.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:09.260]   Dalton made very clear that he never said by charging it's pure but some people try to
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.940]   argue that I don't think that going to ad support necessarily corrupts you or makes
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.420]   means that you can't do other things or you can't control your--
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   Well, that's a great example.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   But there's a consequence.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.860]   Oh, yes, but on media.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:24.140]   There's a consequence to Twitter doing that which is, well, you need to see our web page
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.620]   or use our clients where the ads are presented otherwise a third party client is a bad idea
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.380]   because it takes all of our content without monetizing it.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   Once where Tumblr's going another route where David went away from advertising but then
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.340]   now says that he's basically trying to take the lessons he has about people and how they
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.140]   operate and bring those same lessons to brands and it's up to the brands to come up with
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:51.140]   compelling experiences people want to go to and actually do spread around and he'll,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.540]   you know, share that brand for them.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:59.740]   And as in India, it's up to them to do it well or not.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.780]   This idea that you're selling-- this is a huge issue.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   The idea that you're selling audience, that media is about making content and selling
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.420]   audience is what shifts.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.980]   I just want to post about this today because the Knight Foundation has a great news challenge
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.540]   and the genius should have gotten it last time but that's another story.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.900]   And their next version is mobile.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.380]   At the same time, the New York Times has a new CEO who came from the BBC, no revenue experience
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.460]   and Arthur Salzberger, the head of the New York Times, says that they're going to go
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:34.180]   to mobile and social and whatever the third one was.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.180]   Oh, video.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.780]   So I see a danger in this idea of going to mobile because we in media will think, well,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.180]   then what we're going to try to do is make content and sell audiences through a new
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.180]   pipe.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.740]   And you know on the show I've argued a million times that Google's not about that.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.900]   It's about generating signals about people and thus being able to serve them better.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.460]   And that's what I think mobile is really about here.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.420]   And in that process, you are going to serve merchants too.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.900]   You're going to have to do it in new ways.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.900]   And we can't assume that advertising operates as it did anymore.
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.660]   We can assume that content.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.340]   I just think there are different kinds of companies.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:15.500]   I mean, an infrastructure company is not an advertising supported company.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.900]   I mean, we're not an infrastructure company, but I don't think that PG&E should be ad supported.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.180]   PG&E is our electric company in the state of California, I should explain.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.700]   Conant should not be should not be ad supported.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.700]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.700]   Right.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.340]   And Twitter really kind of straddled that, you know, really you could have gone either
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340]   way.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.860]   It could have been a utility, right?
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.340]   They made a choice to go media advertising.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.340]   I mean, they try different things and that was the one that goes from traction, I think.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.340]   Yes.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.340]   Right.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.660]   You know, they have tried months of different revenue models over the years.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.980]   But I think, you know, the other thing that, you know, but that's by the way, why I admire
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.980]   what Dalton's doing because he said he's making the choice upfront and saying this is,
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   we're going to monetize this and see if it goes.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.340]   No, no, that's that's fair enough.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.460]   But I think the other thing about what's going on with Twitter at the moment is that
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:13.180]   they are trying to, you know, weirdly they're trying to move to the web.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:18.980]   The Twitter that we grew up with, that we're familiar with was primarily SMS based.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.660]   That was the, it's, it's sort of designed center originally.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.900]   And everything that was added to that, you know, that they spent a long time retaining
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.420]   that aesthetic of it must be less than 140 characters.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.500]   We can put it into an SMS on mobile clients, but they're, you know, it's the SMS on your
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   phone.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.020]   And that was their, that was their world view for a while.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.820]   And it was the third parties that built, you know, richer clients that did a bit more.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.140]   And now they've said, no, actually, okay, we're going to embrace the webness of Twitter
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.580]   and the SMS thing, we're going to de-emphasize that a bit.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.620]   And therefore we need to build richer clients.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:54.460]   So I can, you know, I can see how their, you know, their mental evolution has been going.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:00.780]   But that does mean that there's sort of intention with their own, you know, root if you like.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.300]   And I think to some extent, the fact that Twitter works, works very well for celebrities
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:10.180]   was by accident, not by design, you know, the, the, the, the,
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.940]   No, but I think it influenced their decision.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.140]   Oh, it, no, you know, of course it influenced their decision.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.140]   Right.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.180]   But, you know, this was the thing that, you know, it was clear that it was started out
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.420]   as a group messaging technique.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   Right.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.820]   If we're making SMS is better, making, having this message press going on and, you know,
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.540]   those of us who are using it in 2006, remember that.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   But it very quickly became clear that the asymmetric following model and the at replies
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.820]   being secondary was actually a strong feature for enabling conversation between people who
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.220]   have lots and lots of followers.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.020]   Or so you can't have also known as broadcasting.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.420]   No, no, no, no, but that's the point.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:56.540]   It's not because the thing is you can have, you know, a big ring with Rupert Murdoch
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.420]   or whatever going on and you can follow both of them and they can decide to follow each
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.860]   other and join back or you can, you can have a set of TV personalities who are talking
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.740]   to each other over Twitter that happened to be followed by thousands of people.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:17.260]   But because of the structure of it, it actually is stable up to that level of fame.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:23.020]   Whereas it's, you know, that it's quite hard to do that with any other comment system.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.540]   And that so they've been stable by something that worked very well there.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.340]   And therefore they're capitalizing on that.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.820]   And you know, and you know, we saw it through the Olympics.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.420]   You know, suddenly all these people never heard of were enormously famous because they
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:39.700]   were ridiculously skilled and fast and whatever.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.260]   And they were able to, you know, keep using their Twitter accounts.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.060]   And there was a certain amount of trolling going on responses to that.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:52.300]   But they were able to stay using it in that same way while competing in the most, you
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:58.700]   know, intense athletic competition, you know, they will ever see and use that.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   And that's, you know, that's an example of that model, suiting that world very well.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:08.820]   And so there is, you know, there is an affinity between Twitter and mass media that was not
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:14.660]   there when they started and has sort of had this sort of strange effect of, you know,
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:19.540]   I got enormously grumpy that NBC weren't showing the Olympics Open Ceremony live because I wanted
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.180]   to watch it with the Twitter stream.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:27.460]   I wanted to see all the English people, the UK people I follow talking about it and joking
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.100]   about it and saying, oh, that was cool.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.540]   And it suddenly maybe you watched live television.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.300]   And the company that's bought a monopoly on live television wasn't doing it.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.180]   And that was just bizarre.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.900]   So that, you know, there is that interesting synergy that's there.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.980]   And, you know, and the Echo guys are exploring some of that as well.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:52.340]   But the, that has sort of moved Twitter away from, you know, what it was when we started
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:57.460]   using it and what the developers built a lot of the tools for originally, which is the
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.820]   gap that, you know, the dawdness scene and moved into, I think, is saying, okay, we can
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.220]   have conversations with each other.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.180]   And to some extent, it's what Plus is trying to do as well.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.780]   Plus is saying, okay, there's a room for this talking to everyone, but there's also
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.860]   a room for talking to subsets of people and they're trying to explore that space too.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.820]   We're going to take a break.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:19.020]   There's actually Google news too, but I think that's such an interesting story.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.020]   I'm really glad we could cover it.
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.020]   It was a good conversation.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.540]   I'm glad we got to address that.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.620]   And I think that it's kind of ill understood.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.420]   Maybe it's only developers that really get it.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.900]   One more stupid question.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.100]   Why not XMPP instead of Pub/Sub/Hubbub?
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:37.300]   Wouldn't that be better, stupid?
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.380]   They're doing slightly different things.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.820]   So Pub/Sub/Hubbub is designed with this publishing propagation model.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.740]   XMPP is designed with a chat model.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.180]   So there's an assumption, there's more of an assumption of symmetry in XMPP.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:54.500]   It's quite how, you know, Twitter did build XMPP's a little bit early on.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.020]   I was trying to ramble about this a couple of nights ago.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.980]   And it was one of the things that gave them a big spike in users when you could pipe your
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.420]   tweets into your XMPP stuff.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:09.020]   So they found that you hit tension in the way the protocol works because there is an assumption
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   of symmetry.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:14.460]   There is an assumption of I'm following you and you're following me and everything's going
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.700]   back and forth that sort of baked into the way you build XMPP.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.060]   So Pub/Sub/Hubbub is really more for a many to one kind of a conversation.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:26.980]   Well Pub/Sub/Hubbub is better suited to the asymmetric following model.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.140]   Got it.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.140]   That was a good question.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.140]   I didn't know.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.740]   It shows you.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.940]   I thought it was just going to say, "Oh Leo, you're just so silly."
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.540]   We're going to, there are two different things entirely.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.820]   No, that's a good question.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.460]   You can bridge them and you can bridge them.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.620]   Yeah, no, you can use one to talk to the other obviously.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.620]   I just...
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.340]   You can cherry me a mirror on to explain that.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.900]   I thought they may be able to do different layers or something like that.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.700]   But no, actually it was germane.
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.220]   Let's talk about the post office.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.220]   There's an...
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.220]   No, there's a question.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.980]   There's a one to one follow model, huh?
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.540]   Going back to Ben Franklin.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.540]   It's the original XMPP.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.540]   It is.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.980]   Standards that have remained the same for hundreds of years.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.980]   Absolutely.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   And it ain't free baby.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.540]   You've got to pay for that, but that's okay.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.220]   Because it's very cheap.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:24.500]   Actually, if you think about what you get from the post office, somebody will hand deliver
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:30.700]   a physical item for as little as 45 cents anywhere in the United States.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.300]   That's a great deal, right?
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   You know what's not so fun is going to the post office to buy the postage and all that.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.980]   That's why I love stamps.com.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:44.740]   It actually brings the modern age to this very cool thing that's the post office.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.060]   If you use stamps.com, you can use your computer and your printer to print postage.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.420]   You can print it right on an envelope.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.060]   You can send packages and letters of any size.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.060]   There's no limit.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.700]   Well, I mean, there's a physical limit.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.140]   You can't send a house.
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.140]   But you know, I mean, there's no...
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.540]   That 13 ounce thing where you have to go...
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.940]   No, you don't have to worry about that.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:01.940]   You can bring it.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.140]   You don't have to bring it to the post office.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.380]   The mail carrier will pick it up.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.820]   You can even schedule free pickups with the post office.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.060]   Post office loves stamps.com.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.580]   That's why they offer discounts.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.180]   You can't get it to post office.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.460]   Up to 21 percent on Express mail, up to 15 percent on priority mail.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.900]   I'm a big fan.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Stamps.com is awesome.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.620]   In fact, we have two accounts here at the office because we do a lot of mailing.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.980]   If you're an eBay seller on Amazon seller, you'll really love it because it integrates
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.980]   into those systems beautifully.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.300]   You even get a USB scale.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.940]   It tells you exactly what postage you need to put on the package or the envelope.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.940]   I'll tell you what.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.940]   Here's the thing.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:37.940]   Try it.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.460]   We've got a no risk trial offer at Stamps.com.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.460]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.860]   You're going to see an $80 deal.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.980]   Don't do the $80 special offer.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.180]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner that says, "Hurt about us on a podcast.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.580]   Type in Twig."
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.780]   And that $80 offer turns into a $110 offer and you get a picture of me.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.500]   Which makes it even more valuable.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.140]   You get the $55 in free postage.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.460]   You get the free digital scale.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.300]   You get the $5 supply kit.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.260]   You get the four-week trial.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.620]   It is an amazing deal, $110 value.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.180]   And all you do is pay shipping and handling for the scale about $5.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.620]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:23.980]   If you're in the US, Stamps.com, just forget the promo code is Twig for your special $110
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.380]   bonus offer.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.660]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:36.260]   Kevin posted in the chatroom while we were talking this article from TechCrunch.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:42.380]   Google Maps now features schedules for more than 1 million transit stops worldwide.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.980]   So I guess they're figuring out how to aggregate all of that.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.380]   But isn't it the case though that a lot of these metropolitan regions are saying, "Hey,
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.380]   we want to keep this to ourselves?"
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.860]   Yes, there's definitely pushback on that.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:58.020]   But the smarter ones are realizing, "Oh, people can find out when our transit happens.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.020]   That's good."
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.220]   They don't yell at us as much.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.100]   Oh, and they actually pay us money for that stuff.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.020]   We have a revenue model in people getting on trains.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.580]   Let me mention the name of the one in New Jersey.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.180]   It's called Clever Commute.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:15.580]   So folks on this coast joining the cause that it's our information and they should be able
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.580]   to get it out.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:17.580]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.580]   That's just absurd.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:25.860]   It's one of the things that you end up having to fight area by area because we've seen this.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.100]   The big one in the UK was the Ordinance Survey Mapping.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:34.620]   That was set up so that they have really, really great detailed maps of the entire UK.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.260]   But at some point they decided this should be a business.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.140]   And so they had the government mapping department trying to sell maps to companies that did
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.700]   enormous amounts of money.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.140]   And it took a while, eventually it took a while and Google making the example of, well,
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.420]   I think for free is useful.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.660]   And then they flipped it.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.380]   So I think they still have some very high end mapping services, but broadly they have
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.460]   the open access to all these great mapping resources, which means it's easy to find
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   things.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.500]   So if you are gathering data for a public service, getting more users is good.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.460]   But particularly the transit, this should be obvious.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.220]   It should be obvious that if people can find out when your trains are, they can take,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.740]   more of them will take them.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.460]   So Google changed its search algorithm and it's interesting.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:26.500]   The EFF says Google has kowtowed to copyrights holders because there is a now a pirate penalty
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.700]   by the way, which Google's own YouTube apparently escapes.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.220]   If you have been, if you have an inordinate number and we don't know what the number
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:41.780]   is of takedown requests, by the way, approved, whatever that means, takedown requests, Google
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.980]   will kind of not verified, I think, verified, whatever that means valid.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.380]   I think no, I'm sorry.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.340]   That's the word valid.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.900]   Whatever the hell that means.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.660]   I think it means not counter nurses filed against them.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.460]   It's valid unless it's against us.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.540]   That is not valid.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.860]   What do you think of this?
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:11.100]   Is the EFF right that the pendulum is swinging too far into the rights holders or or
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.100]   on the other side?
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.540]   I'm not sure I have a big opinion, but Lauren Weinstein says on Google+ in a very good
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.380]   post, calm down.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:23.220]   It's one factor and indeed, as with spammers, do we really want it when you search for a
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.180]   movie and information on a movie, do you really want the first 20 sites to be?
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.100]   Nothing but torrent sites?
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.740]   Is that the legitimate content that you want there?
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.820]   So it's a factor that I think is probably in the interest of quality search.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:44.180]   Now the other end of it is, yeah, it's cow-towing to the entertainment industry and to copyright
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.180]   interests.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.740]   But there is some level of copyright interest.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:54.700]   I mean, I'm on the right side here, folks, but there is some level that says that I don't
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.540]   think that necessarily putting up torrents of current movies that are in the theater is
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.380]   cricket.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.700]   There are two things the EFF is worried about.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.580]   One is the fact that it's kind of opaque.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:12.660]   Google's not saying what a high number of takedown notices is.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.660]   What is that?
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   How does Google determine it and so forth?
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:18.900]   The other is, and I think this is also an issue, at least from our own experience on
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.300]   YouTube, the false positive issue.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.380]   It's not unusual for rights holder.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.740]   For instance, the Mars Curiosity video was taken down for a day because Scripps Howard
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.860]   News Service asserted the rights to it, even though, of course, they don't own the rights
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.940]   to it, NASA owns the rights to it.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.660]   And so it happens to twit all the time.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.380]   It happens to us all the time.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.100]   And it's Brazilian companies.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.980]   It's companies that I think are trying to game the system, frankly, trying to get their
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   ads on our content.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.260]   Now that's on YouTube.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.620]   And Google says they're not paying attention.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.820]   This is not about YouTube.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:58.340]   It's as if somebody says, I want to take that twit.tv down.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   Those guys are pirates.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.940]   And so far we have, I don't think we've received any of those.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.220]   Well, I think my answer to this is the same as the answer to the three strikes thing, which
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.860]   is if you make three bogus three strikes notices, you get shut off the internet too.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.300]   So if these companies are sending bogus takedowns, they should be penalized instead of penalizing
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:14.300]   certain things.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.300]   Yeah, let's take them off the internet.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:21.100]   If they are generating non-valid DMC requests, then penalize them too.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.740]   That would be a sensible check and balance on this.
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:28.580]   And they're going to need that because the trouble is this is, you know, aggression's
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   law.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.140]   This is as soon as you use, there's another name for it.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.140]   I'll come with the name of it.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:37.100]   As soon as you use something as an indicator, it becomes invalid because people start gaming
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   it.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   Right.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.740]   So it used to be the link graph that they've generated page rank from was wonderful because
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.580]   people making links because they cared.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.140]   But now it's been contaminated by people making links for the sake of influencing page rank.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.740]   It used to be that, you know, writing prose about a topical thing was a good signal.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.660]   And you can talk before.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.020]   Now there are machines and content farms and all kinds of nonsense.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.220]   Google has had to write special code to deal with the fact that three quarters of the web
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.340]   is now robots trying to game them.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.420]   So this will do the same thing.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.940]   This will generate even more DMCA bots.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.540]   It will take the signal and they will have to add some second order corrections to that
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.060]   to say, well, if you're actually someone who's trying to create a tainted signal, you should
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.820]   be penalized too.
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.820]   And if they were smart, you know, they'd have announced that at the same time to try and
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:22.820]   stop people doing that.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.940]   Well, maybe if they're doing it, maybe they're not doing it.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.940]   But you've seen this discussion of, Danny Sullivan's been good about this, talking about
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:36.860]   backlinks with the last two releases of the Search Update iteration, Panda and Penguin,
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.340]   I think.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.900]   Google has been sending out notices saying, your site has dodgy looking backlinks to it.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.500]   You will be penalized for this.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.820]   And suddenly, you know, the people who used to send out send you email saying, please
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   link to me.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.900]   And that sending email saying, please don't link to me.
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.820]   Please remove your links from my site.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.540]   You're damaging my SEO.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:58.620]   You know, so there's this sort of, you know, they, for that one, they've said, okay, fine,
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.980]   we're going to try and squish this a bit.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.660]   And you know, they're going to need to do this.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.500]   You know, the same thing's going to happen to this one in good time.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:11.260]   We will now find all the firms that wrote DMCA takedown bots are going to be going around
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.220]   to everyone saying, well, take your, your competitors now, why don't you do this?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:19.580]   And some of them will fall for it, you know, it'll, it'll, you know, cause more mess.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580]   Google.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.580]   Yeah, I mean, that was my, that was my big concern about is that you basically be able
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.740]   to copyright bomb instead of Google bomb, you know, a site, you could copyright bomb
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:31.020]   them if you decide that, you know, if a right-tolder decided that they had a vendetta with twit.tv
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:37.900]   or Gawker or whatever, they could just, you know, hammer them with, with notices and then
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.340]   that would affect their rank.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.620]   But, you know, the YouTube part of this was interesting to me and I don't think I quite
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.780]   understood it.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.580]   They were basically saying that sites that get large amounts of takedowns because their
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:54.100]   user generated content like YouTube wouldn't be penalized as, as badly.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.100]   I didn't really understand.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.460]   They need to come up with a rule set that allows them to exclude YouTube, but not just making
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   a YouTube rule.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.860]   Well, they did.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.500]   You know, so Danny Sullivan with an update says Google says, Oh, it's not just YouTube.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.780]   Many popular sites will escape the pirate penalty, which doesn't reassure me in the least
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   because they're not saying.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.420]   And it also says, well, what about the unpopular sites we're trying to do?
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.420]   What if I'm not as popular as YouTube?
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.500]   I thought that isn't big enough yet.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   It's a big.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.140]   That's, this is completely missing the point, you two.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.700]   I mean, Google, oh good.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.460]   They say, well, you know, if you're popular, there's other reasons, you know, that, you
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.260]   know, we count more than just the number of notices.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.500]   We're not going to say what we count, but we count more than just the number of notices.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:42.540]   So Facebook IMDB Tumblr and Twitter, they should be fine.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.540]   Oh, great.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.540]   Well, I'm reassured.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540]   Thank you, Google.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.780]   That makes me feel so much better.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.380]   I mean, this is, this is one of 200 signals, right?
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.580]   Is it 200 signals per search result at this point?
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:03.860]   So, but yeah, I, we just, I don't want to be, I don't want to be a chicken little.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.340]   We'll just wait and see what happens.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.380]   But if suddenly Twit disappears from Google search, you'll know.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380]   We know why.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.380]   Those Brazilians.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.380]   Google buys Froemers.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.460]   First they buy a zagat.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.820]   Now they buy Froemers for $143 million.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.900]   I think it was you, Jeff Jarvis, who tweeted, well, at least we know Google's a content
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   company.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.500]   I didn't, somebody else tweeted that and they said the media company and, and you know,
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.540]   I'm not a hundred percent sure about that.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.500]   Actually, I, yeah, they have content in those two forms now, but they have content and
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.660]   data and all kinds of forms, you know, this must schedule, all kinds of stuff that they're
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.980]   serving directly now.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:47.100]   And the thing about the, the travel guy business, I used to work with photos when my last employer
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.820]   owned Random House.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.060]   And as soon as the net came along, man, it was a disastrous business.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:57.260]   As soon as it happened, I'm surprised that Froemers and photos have stuck around partly
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.020]   because nobody really got their act together to do a really good alternative guides.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:11.100]   And so there is some still value value still in having a comprehensive list of top places,
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.660]   which is basically what those things give you.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.740]   But as a business, people weren't buying books anymore and, and they were getting there,
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.700]   so much information from the net that it became a bad business immediately.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.500]   So for Google, it becomes a pretty easy thing to throw this in like zigats and it's just
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.700]   another source of local data.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.500]   Right.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.140]   And it's only a hundred forty three million.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.140]   I mean, really.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   That's nothing.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   Nothing.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.940]   That's only, that's only five FTC finds.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940]   So.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.980]   I mean, that's, it's less than Ricos and by four square.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.500]   Not that Dennis was out of them because he's been, he's tried that once and been burned.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.020]   But yeah, there are things that are building this.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.980]   You know, there is, there is, there is force where there are sites that are successfully
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.060]   building guidebook style data.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:05.380]   So, but I think there's room for, for something that is editorial as opposed to crowd sourced.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   Mm hmm.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.140]   So that's what from ruses.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.420]   Not what zigat is actually zigat is.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.420]   Yeah, it's not different.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.660]   It's a guy that's no different than Yelp really.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.340]   I guess there's some editors collating those votes, but not much.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   Not much.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]   Okay.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.340]   So you pick the quotes.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.340]   So who's going to buy Michelin then?
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.740]   Ooh, because then you get the, the valuable one star.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.740]   I saw the stars.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.740]   You get those stars.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.180]   See Marissa will get for that one.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.820]   I think Marissa will get that a Yahoo.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:37.060]   So she can go around a fancy restaurants and get Marissa did not, did not take the, the
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.760]   Alibaba money and give it back to shareholders, pissing them the market that day, but she's
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   quite right.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.860]   She now has money to spend on these things.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   She is right.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.020]   Keep that money in house.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.780]   And apparently she just joined a flicker today.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.780]   Did you see that?
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.780]   Marissa, just, just, right.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.780]   And double the staff.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   Double the staff.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   Oh, really?
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   Smart as we should be.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.780]   It's going to be happy.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   That's awesome.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.060]   Just like us are going to say, Oh good.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.060]   She likes us.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.060]   She remembered us.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.980]   It was a very smart and probably very cheap thing to do.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.580]   Then I have two employees from five to 10.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.580]   It's not a big deal.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.380]   No, I'm going to be me.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.540]   They have, they have some very good people working on, on, on click of that.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.580]   And here is the, here is Marissa Myers photo stream.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.980]   What more do you need?
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.380]   That's all you need, baby.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.780]   She's still using her Google portrait.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.780]   Is that from Google?
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.980]   Oh, that's our Google executive.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   Oh, maybe that's.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.780]   Maybe that's, maybe just wonder.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.380]   It says his photo was taken six hours ago.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.380]   Yes.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380]   I'm going to be uploaded.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.180]   I'm going to favorite it.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.780]   This is called not, not reading the ex-it data.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.180]   Yep.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.180]   Oh, what's that?
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180]   Ex-if what?
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180]   Huh?
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.180]   Wow, that's great.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.180]   So Deer Marissa Meyer actually worked.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.180]   So there you go.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.180]   Yes, Sean Bonner and the guy.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.220]   So we don't actually have confirmation whether this was, this is actually her and not somebody
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.660]   playing a game.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.660]   That's a good question.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.860]   She did post a bunch of good photos to plus.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.860]   Right.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.860]   Well, tons of her.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   Her ceiling.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.860]   Beautiful ceiling.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.500]   I'm going to add Marissa as a contact and just see.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.780]   So the question is, will Marissa use the data liberation front to get those photos out
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.460]   and on the funny?
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.460]   Google takeout.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.460]   There we go.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.460]   Takeout.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.940]   Just flick it.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.860]   We designed Google should just do it for or just approve that that's the way they are.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   All right.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.860]   Who the magnanimous move?
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.940]   Do I get to do plus Leila Laportia?
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.500]   No, I don't.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.540]   So wait for that.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.540]   Somebody.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.540]   Yeah, this is the new thing.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.860]   And Kevin Marks, you pointed out this might break the internet.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.900]   Well, not quite, but I know I can see why they're doing this.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.980]   So let me explain what they're doing.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.380]   They're vanity URLs.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:07:00.540]   If you go to your Google plus account, your URL is some goofy long number and digit that
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.180]   is, you know, it's kind of hard to keep.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:07.300]   21 digit number, which is the decimal encoding of the internal ID.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:15.660]   I, for instance, in 101261243957076319422.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.580]   And that's a little hard to give out to people.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:23.620]   So someday we will all be able to be plus Leila Laport, plus Kevin Marks.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.140]   So it'd be plus.google.com/plus.
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.820]   Kevin Marks, except.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.780]   So the second plus is the plus symbol.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.700]   And it's often ignored by.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.700]   Climb.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.700]   It's not as ignored.
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:43.860]   The problem is that when you send a URL into a URL from HTML, it turns the spaces into
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:50.340]   pluses, which means that there's a problem with, you know, with using pluses elsewhere
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:54.380]   in the URLs because some of the libraries don't aren't smart enough to write a new question
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.300]   mark first before the pluses of space.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.740]   And so you'll get some encoding issues.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   So it's just old libraries we have to worry about.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:06.180]   Well, Google's internal stuff will be fine, but passing sending URLs with pluses around
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.180]   can be problematic.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:11.340]   You know, it's, it's, you know, but I can see why they did that because it's not plus
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.500]   at Google.com/whatever.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.100]   It's Google.com/plus in Toyota.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100]   Oh, oh.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.540]   So they're actually handing out pieces from the, from the top level namespace, which is
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:27.580]   actually pretty, you know, when I was there to get anything in that namespace, you had
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.420]   to have a meeting with Marissa first.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   Wow.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.020]   Oh, so everybody gets their own.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.020]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.420]   So that plus is the, is the signifier.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.420]   This is a cool.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.460]   So I, you know, I can see how they've done that.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.460]   Oh, I said, when I do that, it makes me so many.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460]   That's kind of crappy.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.500]   Now you, you, Kevin, marks are kind of, uh, grandfathered into profiles since that was
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500]   your product.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.420]   So I don't just be, but anywhere else who signed up at that point.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.340]   So profiles when we go.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.900]   No, they took mine away, Kevin.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900]   They didn't.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.020]   They did.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.940]   Those.google.com gives me a slash Leo LePork gives me a 404.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.940]   They took mine away.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.700]   I think they took people's away.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.420]   Oh, so you are special.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:10.540]   I don't, I don't think it's, so, though he hid his in a place they'll never find it.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.700]   He's in the desk drawer.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.300]   Go get it, Matt.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.260]   The best one is, is, is, is Paul.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.500]   He's got the only four-letter, um, G-mill address.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.980]   Paul Buckeye.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.260]   So if I go to, it does have a G-mill address, less than six characters, but he's got one
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.940]   that's, that's, um, four characters.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.100]   He invented G-mail.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.780]   Is a certain damage to doing that.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.700]   He wins at namespace.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.820]   Um, so is he going to be Google.com/plus-Paul?
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:36.820]   I would.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.820]   No, but maybe not.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.820]   So that's the thing.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.380]   So we set up profiles in the first place.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.220]   We said it'd be one namespace is having 21 digit numbers is crap.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.220]   Right.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.260]   And this was a huge internal fight.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:53.620]   And the answer was okay, but you can only use the, the, the Gmail namespace, which,
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.500]   you know, makes sense because that's the name.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.380]   So it's actually actively managed and they've got a really good mapping service goes back
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.180]   and forth, but it means you're exposing your email address.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:06.980]   So if I go to profiles.google.com/lapport, that should work because that's my Gmail and
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.980]   it does.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:08.980]   Okay.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.980]   So that's my mistake.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.460]   I was using my Google plus name.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.620]   Use your Gmail name.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.620]   Yes.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.620]   So you, so you're, you're Gmail.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.620]   Yeah, that works.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.100]   So the thing that we set up there was the Gmail account and the push back was you're now leaking
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.100]   your email address.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.580]   That's a type of privacy, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.740]   It's like, it's an email address.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.900]   It's not over it and it's Gmail, it's fan filled as it.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.700]   But so that was the push back.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:32.020]   And you did, I know on the bottom of profiles, you used to be able to push a button that says,
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.980]   please go back to a 21 digit number.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.980]   Yes.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:39.260]   And also if you had a Google account that wasn't a Gmail account, so if you set out with
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.540]   a different email address, you could then get yourself a piece of Gmail namespace and
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.820]   use that and they would create a Gmail account for you in the background as well.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:53.660]   So, so I've got some my, my Kevin Marks at Mac.com Google account ended up with some
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.620]   really crappy thing because I was testing something internally.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.940]   It's now called, you know, internal test Kevin Marks or something.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   That's so painful Kevin.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.380]   I've had those.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.300]   So right now Toyota and some big brands, this lady got who was going to get the plus thing?
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   Is it?
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.660]   They said initially they have said, you know, basically they've did, they've declared a
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.660]   new namespace.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.100]   This is a new namespace for Google, which is, you know, they've been trying to get rid
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.100]   of these.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:27.620]   You know, YouTube had their own, Blogger had their own, Gmail had their own and there
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.980]   were a bunch of others, you know, Facebook's been a you could do this on Facebook.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.980]   You've always been able to.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.020]   No, no, Facebook didn't have one for a long time.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.660]   Then we all claimed it in one night.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:36.660]   Right.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.660]   That's right.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   But Google had a whole bunch of companies that bought that had different namespaces and
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.260]   it was trying to consolidate them.
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.380]   And the answer at the time I was there was, it goes into the Gmail namespace.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.820]   So clearly they've done the internal fight to get themselves a new namespace.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.340]   But now they're going to run to the same allocation problem that everyone does, which
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.740]   is all the other Kevin Marks is what that namespace is well.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:01.620]   And you know, people want the three character one, Matt enough to actually hack someone's
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.020]   computer and delete his, his Mac.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:08.620]   You know, so there are, there are issues around namespace allocation.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.860]   And so they're going to, they're about to set themselves up for a sort of big fight over
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.100]   the namespace.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.780]   And I, you know, it'll take a while before they come up with a policy for that.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.220]   And it was the same when Facebook went through this.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:27.380]   Facebook did pre reserve a bunch of brand brand like namespace stuff beforehand.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:32.100]   And they also, there was some favorable treatment for employees, I think, because they seem
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.460]   to have got namespaces before anywhere else could sign up.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.340]   But then they had, they said, okay, now we open the floodgates and everyone can sign
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340]   up for anything.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.980]   Did you guys see this story about the oatmeal?
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:47.620]   The oatmeal did a comic making fun of Google plus saying that nobody leaves comments that
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:51.540]   you have to hand out these terrible long URLs.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.500]   And you know, the example URL was funny.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.060]   I just put the tech run show story in the, in the rundown.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.820]   The joke URL in the comic was something like, you know, blur, gay, SDF, meat pie, donkey orgasm,
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.700]   93 poop.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:11.460]   And so Google actually created that URL and redirects it now to the oatmeal kind of
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.460]   in response.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.460]   Here it is.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   Plus that Google.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.460]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.540]   It's very long.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:23.580]   And so now it goes to Matthew Inman's, who's the author of the oatmeal Google plus account.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.660]   And now this announcement that we're going to get pretty URL.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.660]   So I don't know.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.140]   I give, I give you oatmeal all the credit.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.140]   Maybe he thought it up.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:36.140]   I like that.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.020]   For a while.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.260]   So they say everybody will get it at some point.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:42.140]   Right now, brand big brands are getting it.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.420]   And then it'll be verified Google plusters.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.500]   And then then everybody gets to fist.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.300]   And the unwashed masses.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.300]   And then of course, somebody will have already taken all of the good names.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300]   Right.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.100]   And you'll be Gina 1789 for once again.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.380]   But the thing is, they're so long trying to stop you being, you know, I know.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   I promise.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.740]   Yeah, real names, real names until we have a namespace issue then.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.140]   No, we have a namespace issue.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.300]   Oh, maybe you can use your handles in that bit.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.780]   Maybe I don't know yet.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.420]   So there's probably some huge internal like giant find over what that means and whether
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.820]   the one true bigs with an exclamation mark and had his handle again or right here.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.860]   Hey, this is kind of nice.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:31.220]   If you're a musician streaming concerts on Hangouts, there's now a studio mode that
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:36.420]   gives you a very high quality audio, which is very cool.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.620]   I think that's great.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:44.460]   So when you're setting up your Hangout, you could choose between voice or studio.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:51.580]   And you've seen Huffington Post's new video live dot Huffington post dot com.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.180]   You've really integrated Google plus like crazy in it.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.180]   Oh, interesting.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.940]   I should be watching them since they're doing kind of what we're doing.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.740]   Only they're doing it with news.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:03.500]   They're doing news with people sitting around a little, let me put on now.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500]   It's on.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.100]   They're saying run a little living room talking about movies or something, but then they
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:13.620]   have guests come in on the, they have Cadillac as they're not sponsored by partner.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.700]   I would rather have to be honest for, but okay.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:21.660]   So there they are.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.420]   This is what turned me off completely to it.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.060]   So they've got to hang out going in the back.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.100]   We can get you on.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.420]   So I encourage everyone to make comments and hopefully we can get you on as a community
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:37.940]   member, but you say humans are visual creatures and there's a sign.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:41.740]   I just, I don't, you know, I wonder if this is, if there's a market for this or not.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.740]   Maybe there is.
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.740]   I wonder too.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.740]   I'm really, I don't know.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:45.740]   I don't know.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.740]   It's going 20.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.700]   It's not because I went in, but they're reruns.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.340]   It's very much like us actually.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.940]   They're probably doing something very similar and I just wish Ariana had come to me because
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:01.700]   I could have made a deal on some old equipment.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.300]   I have, that's why Caston's best metayana.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.460]   You could have had very cheaply.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.900]   But it is interesting how they're using Google plus and by the way, or hangouts rather, and
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.380]   by the way, they're, they're doing some branding on it as well, which is kind of interesting.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:21.860]   I wonder who they went to for this, but it's good.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:29.740]   There's also an anchor at KOMU and by the University of Missouri, Sarah Hill, who does,
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:35.180]   she uses Google Hangouts on the air and she actually has people talking to her through
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.300]   her IFB from the public.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.180]   She doesn't want and she gets interesting stuff.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   Wow.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.980]   So there was a new thing.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:46.460]   We set that up so that the chat room could talk to me at any time.
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:47.660]   Just right in your ear.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.580]   Just all the time.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.580]   What?
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.580]   What?
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.500]   You know, that only works because nobody's watching.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.260]   I don't know how she does it.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.220]   She's wonderful because she really does all kinds of great stuff and she has a post-op
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.540]   from her technical person who went through all the technology stuff that they did to
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:08.980]   make this operate to get the air as a feed into the Google plus and the audio, the audio
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:14.980]   and the audio.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.380]   It's interesting because they're switching it like TV.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.980]   They're going second, second, boom.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.900]   I could see a director switching this.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.900]   Look at this.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.500]   They're switching really fast back and forth.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.140]   And they're doing the same thing, Chad, that we do.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.860]   You see there's a Huffington Post window in there.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.940]   We do as we sign on.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.700]   See that black screen there.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:42.620]   They sign on as kind of an account on the hangout and that's how they're able to get the feed.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.900]   Yeah, they don't have, now they're not giving program to their users.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.020]   So the users would either have to have the stream.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.340]   Anyway, this is all technical stuff that I geek out about.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.780]   Yeah, well, it's interesting.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.260]   Again, Ariana called me.
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:59.580]   I like the idea of them turning out the audio quality on Hangouts and just saying prioritize
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:00.580]   audio because-
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.580]   It's great.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:05.140]   You know, you still need like and now exported for me as an MP3.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:06.140]   Would you nicely?
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.380]   That's the piece that YouTube is kind of bad.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.660]   But that's valuable for doing these kinds of things.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.220]   Certainly would help us get tunnel vision going and if that production process was a
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.220]   bit more streamlined.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.220]   Right.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.220]   That'd be perfect, by the way.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.220]   Technology for tunnel vision.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.820]   Yeah, I'm going to go and play with it and see if we can get tunnel vision back on
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.580]   the air.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.740]   I didn't realize it was off the air.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.740]   Tunnelvision.tv.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.660]   We're taking a break.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.660]   hiatus.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:37.860]   I don't know how it is because we lost our producer and me being the producers didn't
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.820]   actually work because nothing ever got posted.
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:42.140]   So we need to work out a way to get it posted.
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.260]   So if you want to be a producer, go away.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:52.700]   I like it that they have found new Egyptian pyramids, perhaps thanks to Google Earths.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.580]   And this is not, this is Google Earths set.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.020]   I didn't know Google owned a satellite.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.180]   I thought they were buying images from other companies.
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.020]   Yeah, they put some money into one satellite.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.780]   I'm not actually completely.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:08.100]   It says according to his Google Earth, watching you.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.260]   Yeah, they're watching you.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.260]   The sky.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.260]   Located about money.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.060]   Keep with them driving with those cars.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.740]   It stays over Germany all day.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:22.500]   It's, it's really interesting.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.900]   I mean, they actually, I don't know who was looking at the pictures, but.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.540]   So was this, was this verified?
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.300]   These were definitely pyramids that they didn't.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.300]   There's possibilities that it wouldn't be it.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.740]   So there's some doubt, but it, but you know, it's pretty man made looking.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:40.340]   And it is, it is just 12 miles from Abu Sidum, which is another site.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.660]   So it's in the, it's in the right spot to do it.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:49.180]   I think it's, but although it's quite large, so it might in fact be a significant find.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180]   Kind of cool.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180]   Amazing.
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.180]   Isn't that?
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.180]   And that, that looks pretty man made.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:57.380]   Either that's the Mars Curiosity crane that just got a little off track.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.820]   I don't know.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.380]   Anyway, cool.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   Here's another one.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:12.380]   Man, etch his name and sand visible from space.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:19.260]   The world's largest graffiti by Hamad.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:22.620]   Just, just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.020]   It's also a canal.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.020]   Yes.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.700]   It's a artificial waterway.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:36.020]   He's a 63 year old billionaire Hamad being Hamdan Al-Nayan, who has enough money to carve
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.220]   his name into the sand.
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.980]   Or pay someone to do it for him.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.420]   Well, I doubt he did it himself.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.340]   He's 63 for crying out loud.
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.340]   Yes.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.340]   You know what that means, Jeff.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.340]   You got a P every hour.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.420]   No time to carve.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.740]   Let's see.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:54.860]   Sky drive for Android coming in just a few weeks.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:57.700]   RIM says Blackberry 10 is available for licensing.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.300]   Anybody want it?
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.300]   Mueller.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.300]   Mueller.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.300]   Anybody?
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.300]   Blackberry 10?
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:05.300]   Anyone?
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.300]   It's like, what?
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.300]   Cheap.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.300]   Anyone?
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.300]   Computer science economy.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:16.980]   We talked about this on security now.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:21.500]   Khan Academy is going to do a kid's school, kid computer science class, which is great.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:27.340]   Anybody figured out Ev Williams and Bizstones medium?
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.340]   Here it is.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:29.340]   Welcome to Medium.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.900]   We're rethinking publishing and building a new platform from scratch.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.980]   He's the guy who founded Twitter, Ev Williams.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.140]   Blogger, Ev before that.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   So this may be more like Blogger than Twitter, right?
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:45.620]   No, I can't quite figure it out, but basically you, well, how did Dave Winer put it?
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:49.940]   You contribute to a collection.
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.940]   Well, you're not really publishing on your own.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:52.940]   There's a discussion.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:53.940]   Like Pinterest.
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:54.940]   So it's not--
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:55.940]   So it's not--
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.940]   It's not--
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.380]   It's not time-centric and it's not author-centric.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.340]   It is vague topic-centric.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:07.820]   So in some ways it's closer to being a wiki model, except that you get multiple entries
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820]   on a given topic.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.820]   Here's an example.
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:14.460]   I haven't got any disability yet, so I'm in order to like things.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.380]   It's also massively non-brosable, which is weird.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.540]   And I asked Ev about this on Twitter and he said, oh, yeah, we can use Twitter for that
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.540]   for now.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.220]   But it's actually quite hard to find things unless you get a URL from outside.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:29.100]   And the way they-- if you embed a link in it that goes through some redirect that doesn't
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.660]   work very well, so Google can't call it very well either.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:39.460]   So it's this sort of weird thing of its own that is also not very discoverable or browsable.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.460]   Here's--
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:41.900]   Here's an example page.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:42.900]   This happened to me--
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900]   This happened to me.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.060]   Life made of stories.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.860]   Kevin Rose has posted a little story in here about peeing with Al Gore.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.940]   So there you go.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:53.940]   That's what you're--
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.940]   Raising the tone as Evie.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.300]   Well, I can't think of this, but there's another company, a new company called Fink Sponge.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.340]   Or it's a weird name.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.340]   Craig Silverman, who does regret the error, who's a wonderful, wonderful guy, Canadian
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:12.140]   redundant now, who started a new platform that I saw that some media companies are going
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.580]   to start to use, where it's a collaboration platform.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.740]   And it occurred to me as I was talking to them that I think that this is a little bit
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:22.900]   of what Evie's saying, I think, is that blogging became a chance for individuals to
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.900]   finally speak.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:29.900]   And I think there's a layer above that that organizes collaboration on creation in other
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:30.900]   ways.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:33.260]   This is a photo page that they use as an example.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.140]   This kind of makes sense.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.700]   And I can almost see this taking off.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.620]   This is-- when I was a kid, things were different.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.140]   You post a picture of when you were a kid.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.020]   When I was a kid, I read the manual.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:46.180]   When I was a kid, we played with electronic kits, not computers.
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.900]   When I was a kid, it was okay to wear this shirt.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.060]   I can see people doing this.
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.540]   Well, I mean, blogging's been around for more than a decade.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.380]   It's time to rethink what this is.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:00.980]   There's another one, Jonathan Harris did "Cowbird" as a storytelling platform that was used by
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.380]   National Geographic for a big project.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:08.180]   So I think it's time to rethink this whole notion of how we publish.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.740]   This is really interesting.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   It seems very ephemeral.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:16.540]   Especially since it's not searchable, it's not linkable.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.860]   It's Twitter wasn't it first either.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.940]   But it also has upvotes in it.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:26.020]   So the point is each of these pages-- each of these sub pages has upvote.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.020]   It has upvote somewhere.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.020]   This is good.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:31.020]   This is shiny.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.020]   Got it.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.500]   There got a very number of phrases there.
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.500]   Good one.
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.340]   And you have the author with Twitter to do that.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.780]   And then by default, they organize the categories by most voted on.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.700]   You can actually reorganize them by new.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.340]   There's a little interesting versus new.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.340]   Click at the top.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.340]   It's not sticky.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.980]   So every time you pop back, it goes back to interesting.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.980]   I just signed in.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.060]   I just authorized it with the wrong account.
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:58.580]   I have an account called Wasted Leo.
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:02.340]   And I have now authenticated.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.340]   Excellent.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.340]   Oh, this is not good.
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.780]   Well, I thought there may come a time when I'd like to post drunk.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.420]   Well, you could post about urinating with Al Gore as well.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.780]   This might--
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.620]   Well, Wasted.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620]   We need to follow that now.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.900]   It's got followers.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.620]   No, I think everybody should follow Wasted Leo.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.260]   You'll know it from the profile pic.
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.820]   And go ahead.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.820]   You can show it.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.900]   Do you have you stood--
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.180]   Anyone famous at a urinal?
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.820]   I think Gina Davis.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.820]   But I'm not sure.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.820]   I did.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.140]   What?
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.020]   I have four as fucker from F-fruit.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:38.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:41.700]   OK.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.620]   Well, that was a good topic.
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:50.180]   So the rules page of media says there aren't many.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.820]   In fact, there can pretty much all be summed up
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.340]   thusly.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.980]   Don't pee in the pool.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   There you go.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.500]   That's cool.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.460]   You can't pee in your room.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   It's not in pools.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.620]   It's very focused.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.420]   We're going to take a break.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.260]   Come back with our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.060]   We've got coming up very quickly,
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.260]   triangulation in just three minutes.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.540]   And that's exciting because it's going to be Phil Leiben
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:09.980]   of Evernote, the CEO and founder of Evernote,
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.540]   which is a really interesting freemium model and very smart
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.780]   guy with lots of interesting things to say.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.100]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about our
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.660]   friends at the Ford Motor Company.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.940]   Here's another new site, social.ford.com.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:28.700]   I find it really interesting to watch this company.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.620]   More than 100-year-old, century-old company
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.260]   march into the 21st century.
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.980]   They've done it with their cars and the technology in their
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.700]   cars.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.460]   This is a social site around Ford.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.660]   And they're doing badges, which is kind of interesting.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:47.340]   In fact, you can get a tech geek badge while you're here.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.300]   They have--
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:52.020]   I'll probably get the Mustang badge because I'm a mustache.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.780]   But there is the tech geek badge.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:54.260]   See that?
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:58.460]   Great outdoors, off-road, flex, I drive one.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.140]   This is smart.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.460]   There's also an interesting article by a fella you might
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:02.980]   know.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:03.660]   Here's the idea.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:07.620]   There's articles on Ford Social Social.ford.com about
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:09.700]   all sorts of things.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.940]   But there's also a chance for you to post your ideas.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.660]   Here's an article that I wrote for them about an interview I
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.740]   did with one of their technologists.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.500]   We talked a lot about autonomous vehicles and so forth.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.580]   But if you have an idea for a way Ford could make their
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.980]   cars better, you can also post
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.860]   there.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.900]   There's some really interesting stuff in here.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.980]   You read my article because I talk a little bit about the
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:41.300]   GPS, some of the autonomous stuff like lane departure
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.180]   warnings that they're putting in their work, what they call
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.780]   what Ford calls workload information management.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.900]   This is an interesting, although controversial idea.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.900]   The car is paying attention to the conditions.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.460]   If it's like rainy or the road slick or whatever, it will
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:57.140]   actually shut down some of the things that you can do in the
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:58.300]   car.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.500]   In effect, paying attention.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.940]   And I think it's a great idea, but a little controversial.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.660]   You can read about it and cast your vote.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:10.260]   Lots of interesting ideas here.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.860]   Weight sensors to keep an alarm to sound if there's
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.260]   somebody sitting in the seat and it's too hot.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:19.380]   There's some really interesting Wi-Fi music sharing
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.260]   between cards.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:25.460]   A 15-year-old submitted a biodiesel hybrid post.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.180]   Social.Ford.com.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.940]   Get in there, grab your tech geek badge, and read that
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.300]   post that I wrote about Jim Butchkowski.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.020]   It was a very interesting conversation we had about how
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.420]   the Ford wants to use the cloud, for instance, to sink your
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.180]   car or your vehicle to your home or office.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.260]   Social.Ford.com.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.180]   Gina Trapani, it is time for your tip of the week.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.100]   And I know you're happy about this one.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.820]   For those of us with multiple Google accounts, and that's all
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.900]   of us here on this panel and probably lots of our listeners,
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:03.140]   Google's launched a new sign-in page, which is an account
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.820]   chooser.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.540]   You have to enable this, by the way.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.420]   But once you enable it, you associate all the different
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.340]   Google accounts that you control.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.420]   And when you go to this sign-in page, once you have it
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.860]   enabled, it's accounts.google.com/accountchooser.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.580]   It shows you a list, and you launch whichever account you
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:20.620]   want to go into from the list.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.580]   So simple little tweak, but definitely handy for those of us
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580]   who have multiple accounts.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.620]   And where do I enable that?
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.100]   Because I--
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:27.620]   Oh, here it is.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.140]   It looks like.
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.100]   Right in the front page, you can improve your Google
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.660]   experience by connecting your accounts.
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:33.860]   No, that's from other services.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:34.820]   Where do I--
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:39.460]   If you go to accounts.google.com/accountchooser, does it--
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.380]   Let's try that.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.460]   Let's see if you can enable it there.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.780]   I clicked on a link from Life Hacker, which I'll actually--
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.860]   I'll add to the show notes.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.980]   Account chooser, maybe account singular chooser.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.660]   Yes.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.380]   So there you go.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:52.660]   Add an account.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.660]   You add an account that you want to add to your list.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.660]   And then it'll show you that list of accounts you've added
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:29:59.660]   and say, collect them out.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:29:59.660]   So great.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.300]   I have about 10 Gmail accounts.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.500]   This will be very, very handy.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.940]   Yeah, to be a better launcher.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:05.940]   Yeah, that'll be good.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.660]   Quick shameless plug.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.060]   My Android app to do text, which you can go to to do txt.com.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.140]   Reach 1.0 this week.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.980]   So it's available in the Play Store.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.340]   And I'm awaiting Amazon approval.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.740]   So it should be in the Amazon App Store as well.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.740]   Very simple text-based task list.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.900]   It syncs to Dropbox.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:27.740]   You can archive your stuff that you've completed to done.text now.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:31.540]   We added some cool swipe gestures and some sinking bug fixes.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:34.260]   So check it out if you haven't already to do text.com.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.860]   I am going to upgrade right now.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.180]   How exciting.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:37.580]   That's cool.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580]   Thank you.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.460]   And we have new art.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.700]   It looks awesome on the Nexus 7 on the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.980]   So we have the extra high DPI icons now.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.660]   Oh, it's really neat.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:48.460]   Yeah, it looks really nice.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.460]   Cool.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.340]   Allow new access to my Dropbox.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:54.740]   That's great.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.580]   Very nice.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.900]   Oh, there it is.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:58.220]   Very nice.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.900]   All mom, iPhone plus familial piece.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:06.420]   That's the Tom Anderson of to do that text.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.180]   Everybody gets one item.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.260]   Call your mother.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.020]   All mom.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.660]   All your mother.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.300]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:19.580]   Well, in Moby, a mobile ad company has a survey.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.180]   And take these with a gray with a salt shaker.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.540]   But they insist that mobile web users spend more time
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.300]   watching their phones than watching TV.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.060]   144 minutes a day to 141 minutes a day.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.060]   And other numbers, 96 minutes on a computer, 90 on a radio,
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.820]   43 reading, and so on.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.700]   Then other stats, 77% of people confess
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.460]   to using mobile devices in bed, 70% while watching TV,
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:49.340]   65% while waiting for something, 43% while with family.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.500]   Yes, we do.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.540]   41% in the bathroom.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:56.020]   So finally, we're all out of the closet and in the bathroom.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.660]   And so on and so on.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:01.180]   So just some little stats for you today.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:05.100]   My tool of the week is something I reviewed on the Gizwiz.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.700]   And I've been using it now for about a month.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.540]   And I love it.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.300]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could take your Google Voice account
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.700]   and attach it to your phone so that when your phone rings,
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.020]   it's your Google Voice number.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:17.060]   It actually rings a phone in your house.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.260]   This is a little box called the Obihy.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.380]   It's only $30.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.740]   It's very inexpensive.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.140]   They actually have a couple of different Obs.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:26.380]   But what happens-- and by the way,
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.860]   once it's set up that does not rely on their server,
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.940]   it uses Google Voice.
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:33.220]   It does kind of a weird hack, I think, with Google Voice
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.100]   to use Google Chat.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.260]   But what happens is when somebody calls my Google Voice
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:41.460]   number now, it rings a phone.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.620]   In my house, I pick it up.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.340]   I can make phone calls from it.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.580]   Free phone calls to other Ob users.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.060]   It's--
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.020]   Wait, like a landline?
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:49.740]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.980]   Well, it's like a landline.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:51.660]   Yes.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:52.340]   Except it's not.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.140]   It's connected to my internet.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.020]   Oh, I see.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:33:00.060]   So it becomes a true vote-voit solution that's free
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.260]   because it's using Google Voice.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.420]   And it's only $30.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.380]   There's no monthly fee or anything.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:06.980]   The box is very inexpensive.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:08.780]   I use the Obihy 100.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:13.180]   There's a 110 that gives you, I think, two lines.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.660]   Or actually, I think it connects to your regular landline
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:18.340]   so you can have a single phone that will--
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:21.500]   so it bridges to your voice service as well as VoIP.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.220]   So a single phone that answers both numbers.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:26.220]   So this is a great way to tie your Google Voice number
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:29.860]   into your home phone and make Google Voice calls
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:31.340]   on an actual--
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:32.540]   what appears to be a landline.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.260]   I really like this.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.140]   And it's been expensive.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.620]   Obihy.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.380]   Obihy.com.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.620]   Hey, that was fun.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.500]   Thanks to Dalton Caldwell for joining us
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:43.220]   on short notice.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:45.780]   I hope we didn't screw up his talk tonight.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.220]   His Airbnb talk.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.540]   I'm sure we improved it.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.100]   Everybody should go see his Airbnb talk.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:52.220]   How about that?
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.580]   We'll sell some tickets for him.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:54.300]   There you go.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.980]   If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area,
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.940]   you can go do that.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:05.060]   Kevin Marks, Tomovision.tv as soon as they get a producer.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:07.020]   And salesforce.com.
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:10.020]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.380]   I suppose the relevant salesforce thing to plug
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.900]   is Chatter Communities, which we've announced yesterday, which
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.260]   is letting you build--
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.940]   to Chatter is the salesforce internal Twitter, if you like.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.260]   The thing that lets you talk amongst people
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.620]   who are inside your company.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.140]   Chatter Communities are ways to extend that to your customers
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:31.740]   as well.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:33.220]   And we announced that yesterday.
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.300]   It's salesforce.com/tow/communities.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.740]   With the idea that companies can open these kinds
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.620]   of conversations with their customers as well.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   Ah.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.900]   What an interesting idea.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:46.220]   So we're getting towards lots of these things
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.140]   that will plug together.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.300]   And I'm hoping that we can get some of these to plug into these
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.060]   other bits as well.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.420]   That would be nice.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.700]   Jeff Jarvis, the author of Public Parts.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.540]   You must buy the book.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.780]   He's also Professor of Journalism at the City University
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:58.340]   of New York.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.700]   And blogs@buzzmachine.com.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.380]   Thank you, Jeffrey.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:03.220]   Thank you.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.620]   Thank you to the lovely and talented--
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.460]   by the way, what designer clothes
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.300]   do you wear, Gina Trappani?
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.300]   Oh.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.140]   I loved it.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.700]   When did you heard about that, right?
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.780]   Hillary Clinton, some reporter, is talking
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.780]   to our Secretary of State and says, what designers do you like?
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.260]   And she said, would you ask a man that question?
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.300]   Would you ask that?
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.420]   And the reporter said, oh, no.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:29.420]   I--
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.860]   Also, I missed my chance.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.780]   Would you ask a man that question, Leah?
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.020]   I would, in fact.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.740]   And I wish somebody would ask me because I'm
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.620]   wearing Tommy Bahama today.
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.100]   Ah, Tommy Bahama.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.260]   Gina Blogs@smarterword.org is the author of ThinkUp
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.300]   at ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:52.220]   And is, of course, a very welcome and very
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.220]   snappily dressed member of the--
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.340]   With my white t-shirt.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.740]   Here's the Airbnb talks.
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:01.500]   They're at Airbnb.com/techtalks.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.540]   And there is still room to sign up for Dalton Caldwell's
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.900]   talk, 6 p.m. San Francisco time,
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:10.780]   if you're in the San Francisco area.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.340]   I thought I'd give him a look plug for that.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.620]   Thank you.
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:15.340]   You should ask Aneel what designer clothes he wears.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.500]   That would be much more interesting.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.220]   Yes, next time Aneel Dash is on.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.860]   Aneel makes me look really bad all the time.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.500]   He is always well dressed.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.060]   He's sharp dress man.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:28.580]   I like a guy who knows how to wear pointy shoes and look good.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.260]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.660]   The heels I'm not so sure about.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:33.860]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.300]   We do the show Wednesday's 11 a.m.

[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:38.300]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.100]   That's wrong.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.500]   1 p.m.
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.180]   Pacific.

[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.740]   I don't think you want to miss it a number.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.380]   Thanks, everybody.
