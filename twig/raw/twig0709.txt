[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey as the week off. Glenn Fleischmann is here. He'll give us some jeopardy tips from his appearance there.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.300]   And Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis, Elon Musk and others say let's pause AI research until we're sure this is safe.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.000]   Is that the right thing to do? The internet archive loses its fight, but should they have lost?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.700]   We'll also talk about TikTok and a Norwegian ammo company that says we can't make bullets because TikTok is right next door.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.500]   All that and a lot more coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500]   This is Twig.

[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show we get together with some people that I like and talk about stuff that really has nothing to do with Google.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.300]   So really false advertising all around. Ant Pruitt is here from Hands-On Photography. Hello Ant.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300]   Hello Mr. LaPorte. How you be, sir?
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.300]   Did you enjoy Richard Campbell's description of distillation on the weekly?
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.300]   Unfortunately, I couldn't watch the live stream because I was stuffing my face with the awesome Twig provided lunch.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   Oh, well. Yes. Given the choice of time, lunch and any of our shows, I would choose lunch.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   I don't blame you. But I will be going back and checking out the read.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.300]   Yeah, it was good. We were talking about still. It's now been like a three or four part series on how whiskey is made.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   It's really fascinating. Also with us, the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School,
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   Journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   Hello, hello, hello, Buzzmachine.com. Did you get a new camera, a new hairdo? What's going on?
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   The hair. I don't know. Is it ridiculous? It's gorgeous. It's not. It looks like George Washington.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   I don't know what to do. I've got more than you want to know. I've got cow licks all over.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   So this was just up and up on its own. If you could get a powdered wig that looked like that, I would wear it. It's fabulous.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   Hey, I think I'm going to take that as mockery. No, it looks good. It looks really good.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   No, and you're not too pink, which is why I'm asking about the camera. I mean, just really look.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   No, no, no, it's just the lock of the moment when I come on. That's all. It'll screw up.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   It's the lighter here now, so the light will change. The glow of the light from Bedminster. Just glowing on you.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   Also here. The light from the west. Stacey has a week off, but good news. Glen Fleischman has agreed.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   Has contributed to fill in. Oh, nice to see you. Welcome. Hoya, Hoya. Nice to see everybody.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   Oh, Hoya. I'm Glen.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.300]   I'm Glen. This is the success of his Kickstarter. Oh, that's right.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   That's right.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   So how much did you raise for shift happens? $753,000 and some change.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300]   That would be three quarters of a million dollars. Amazing.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.300]   Amazing. Pretty wild. Pretty wild. People like keyboards.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   Which you helped kind of foster, written by Marchin. That's not the book.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   This is a great book. WicRace. I say it carefully. Shift happens.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   That's great. It's all about keyboards.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.300]   There's something about keyboards and keyboard nerds. It's just kind of amazing.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   So congratulations. Thank you. It's very exciting.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.300]   What do you do with the extra money? Is that like a payday for Marchin or?
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.300]   Well, you know, mattresses feel really good when they're stuffed with the banking system.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   The banking system is a best place to put your money out.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   Well, no, we make things get better. So that's the Kickstarter thing is it's really hard to change your pricing and tiers.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   Like at one point where like could we reduce the shipping, although shipping is kind of inflexible.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   So instead we've we had stretch goals. So instead of originally it was like, well,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   at a third volume of some extras, now the third volume is going to be 160 pages and full color.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   So the whole thing is actually 1,376 pages. We're denuding entire forests.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   Yeah, there's a lot of trees are dying for this.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   Some very long and complicated conversations with the printers in Maine.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   Fortunately, there are a lot of trees there, Maine. They could just go chop a few more down in order to reduce the paper.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   You've also put some energy into games on the shift happens website. There's some really fun stuff.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   Yeah, Marchin made this great one, which is a typewriter or like a manual typewriter simulator,
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   which is shift happens dot site slash typewriter. And if you go there, you can type and it has like a piece of paper.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.300]   You can move around and actually has if you type too fast and over types.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300]   It's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.300]   The whole generation, it has no idea what a typewriter is.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.300]   Yeah, some of the dial phone. I'll tell you one of the funniest things that I did a few months ago is YouTube brought up this.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.300]   You know, those old self help, not self help videos, but they were like sometimes multi hour VHS as you'd get.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300]   There would be how to use the Commodore 64 or something like that.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   And this shows up a digitized version on YouTube feed and my 15 year old is like, oh, let's watch that.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.300]   And everything is amazing to them. They're like, wait, you could choose from 16 colors.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   Like, yes, we had as many as 16 colors.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   The guy goes to pull the five and a quarter inch discount and my like, I was like, what is that?
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.300]   I'm like, oh, well, that was the smaller disk. I used to work with eight inch disks.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   They said, Oh, did eight inch disks hold more storage? I said, no, no, of course not.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   Hey, how's last? So it's kind of fun to close the kids to it because they're these just as weirdly.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:58.300]   Everything is big and floppy and strange and they can't even envision like, wait, you worked with this?
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.300]   Yeah. So that's it's always a type.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   Typer is a much more approach. Right. You sit down, you start tapping away at it. It's great.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   I went to, we know three typewriter stores in Washington state within about an hour of each other.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   I went to one that just opened. So apparently we're in a typewriter store boom.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   Oh, you would be. Yes. So I don't think we're ready to announce anything yet, but there's a chance that Glenn and I
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   and Marson and Doug Wilson will be together in Massachusetts for that's right.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300]   Yes. Very exciting. Right after July 4th.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.300]   At the end of the year.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   At the incredible Austin Riggs Center for the perpetually depressed. It's going to be.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.300]   It'll be so much fun. So much fun. That's great. Congratulations. It's really wonderful.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.300]   Thank you. It's nice to see good things happen to nice people since they so often happen to awful people.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   Well said. So our top story tonight, our top story tonight is Elon Musk and others calling for a pause.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.300]   A six month pause on AI citing profound risks to society.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   So Elon can catch up.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   Yeah, maybe that's, you know, first of all anything Elon thinks is a good idea is a bad idea to me.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   But a lot of other co-signers including Stephen Wozniak, the founder of Apple, the presidential candidate and universal basic income supporter Andrew Yang,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   lather or a general blather, Rachel Bronson, who is the president of the bulletin of the atomic scientists.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   Gary Marcus, an entrepreneur and academic.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   Listen, that atomic clock that doomsday clock has never hit 12. Yeah. Clearly.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:52.300]   I interfeasionalizing the George Church a couple of weeks ago on triangulation. He's a father of modern genomics,
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   but also new member of the board of the atomic clock folks, the bulletin of atomic scientists.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   And I asked him, he said, yeah, I noticed it never hits. Never hit. They said, he said, I don't know how long he's going to last on the board.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   He said, yeah, it seems to be that the, as if they can get as close as possible to noon.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   That's always a good thing to get more press that way.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   In fact, the most recent story about the atomic clock, you know, the idea of the doomsday clock is if it ever hits noon, it's over for the planet.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   And the closer we get to the noon, the closer we are to Armageddon.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.300]   Is it midnight? It's midnight, not noon.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   It is the bright sun above our heads. It's midnight. You're right, of course, noon, whatever, midnight, 12 o'clock.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.300]   But the most recent story was it's closer than it's ever been before.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.300]   Really? Closer than the Cuban Missile Crisis, really?
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.300]   Anyway, anyway, it is maybe perhaps atomic link bait. I don't know.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   I might have quoted this on the show before, but one of the best things that the guy who did fake Steve Jobs said was,
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   always quote this, is when Google announced the Open Hand Set Alliance, he said something like,
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   "Loser's join alliances." And there's something about, if you're winning, you don't need an alliance, you just have your product.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   So it was something about Elon Musk and a bunch of people saying, "Whoa, this is going too fast because we're not ready for it yet."
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   It does be a little science-
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   Well, as many people have pointed out, of course, great idea. We should stop open AI while China just goes right on a head-catching up.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.300]   I mean, there's so many obvious, this is just such an obviously non-starter of an idea.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.300]   And the thing that I've seen a lot of is that it's more of tech boy ego.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   Yeah, I think that's it.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   We're so powerful. We're so dangerous. Stop us before we kill.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   Oh, we could do terrible things, right?
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.300]   Yes.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   That's what somebody said unmasted on is the letter reads as basically PR hype for the power of AI.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   Exactly.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.300]   Wow, we're really getting close to AGI. We should stop.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   [laughter]
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:05.300]   Whereas I think most intelligent people say we are not close to artificial general intelligence.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.300]   The language that it is just ridiculous.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   And you know, if you don't connect chat GPT-4 to anything that has agency in the world, it's probably pretty harmless.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   It's not exactly, you know, going to set off the nuclear weapons or anything.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   It can't, right?
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and on truth?
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   Should we automate all the jobs at green to fulfilling ones?
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber out smart obsolete and replace us?
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   Huh? Should we?
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.300]   Should we?
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   You know, the motorized clothes...
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   And you lost your chance.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   Come on, there you go.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   I was waiting on you to pause.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.300]   Oh, no, it never was a great read.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   It doesn't happen.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.300]   The crank-driven clothes-ringer really, I think, made a lot of housewives unhappy.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   Yeah, because it took away one of their primary pleasures during the day.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   We should have put a six-month pause on that hand-ringer.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Damn it.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   Just really had a commit.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   Let's form a committee to analyze the impact of the hand-ringer on the women of America.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.300]   I'd seems to be so much panic about the chat-based AI stuff, but you know, we are already seeing incredible limitations.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.300]   We don't know...
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   MLF said this before, but I feel like there's this idea that all technology reaches an apotheosis, but AI has limitations.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.300]   We don't know how close they get.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:34.300]   Like, can chat-based GP... can a generalized chat-based AI that can answer kind of any question?
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   Can it actually be trained to not hallucinate?
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   We don't know the answer to that.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   Nobody in computer science or in businesses knows the answer.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   So hallucination, like invention of things, may just be an inherent risk in the algorithm.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   There's no way to do that without clamping down and making it domain expertise specific, which could be very useful,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   but it's not, doesn't prove the same kind of scare.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   The other thing, Glenn, I think you're right.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   A, I think the answer to that is no.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   In its present form, large language models, a million vendors are talking about this all the time cannot do that.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   B, you're right.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.300]   If they were domain-specific, then perhaps.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:18.300]   What gets me most out right now is that in their present form, it is wildly irresponsible for Microsoft and Google to talk about their use in search one.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   And two, it is wildly irresponsible for media to turn around and "I caught it in an error!
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   It's going to destroy mankind!"
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.300]   And then have an impact on where we are.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   I got a discussion about this with somebody on masks today.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.300]   "Well, shouldn't we stop? Should we stop?"
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   There's a great essay by James Doer from the Rand... whatever it is, Rand Corporation.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   In the 90s.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   So we've got to get to the unintended consequences faster.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   So we get to the experience, so we learn what the impact are, so we can then do something.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   If we stop it, we can't learn anything.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   Then we just stop at the clock for six months, then we'll come back in six months and say, "Oh, do we know anything more?"
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   No, we can't.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   We didn't use it.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.300]   So before you use chat GPT to cheat on Wertle...
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   By the way, so John, you must have had a Wertle game where you had the second letter you knew.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.300]   The second letter you knew was you. The fifth letter is "O."
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:18.300]   So John asked chat GPT, "Do you know any five letter words where the second letter is "U" and the fifth letter is "O?"
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.300]   It suggested flute.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   Eh.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.300]   [Laughter]
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   What?
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   What?
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   Brute, fruit, grunt, truce, sprew, crude, prune, sprog, and glute.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.300]   None of which F.O. in the fifth letter.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   That doesn't understand anything.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   And none of which have you in the second letter.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   It was just wrong.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   So then you gave it a little nudge.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   And the answers you gave, John, says, "The second letter is not you."
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.300]   I apologize for the error in my previous response.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:15:00.300]   Here are some five letter words where the second letter is "U" and the fifth letter is "O."
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   Bound.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   Clout.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Flout.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   Flout.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   No.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   No.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   It can't even play wortle.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   No, I asked it to -- there's a new product called a wavelength.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:18.300]   It's like an integrated chat-based thing with -- it's a human-based group chat system.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   Yes, this is John Groover's ridiculous -- okay, go ahead.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   But I just tried the chat -- it has integrated chat GPT in it.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.300]   And I'm like, "Oh, because everything's better with an AI in it, right?"
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   So I said -- I said, "I figure this is a straightforward one."
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   It said, "Explain Einstein's theory of relativity as a very short poem in AABB -- or ABAB format."
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   And it gives me AABB.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   And I said, "No, you're wrong.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   That's AABB.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   This is -- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.300]   You're right."
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.300]   And it gives me AABB again.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   It's like, "No, that's still -- did you know how to do this?"
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   And it gives me AAAA.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   And I'm like, "You're still -- I said maybe you shouldn't be writing poetry chat GPT."
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   Because it's -- you know --
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.300]   But that --
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   Honestly, chat GPT4 probably would do that better.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.300]   I don't know what chat they put into wavelength.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   Wavelings is an interesting story.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.300]   So you got suckered in, too.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   John Gruber on his daring fireball -- Oh, I'm going to try anything.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   -- publishes like a 4,000 word article about halfway through.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   He says, "Oh, by the way, I'm an advisor to it and they gave me some stock."
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   That's what --
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   So you should have put it front, you know, #add -- #sponsor.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   I think John thought because it wasn't a lot of stock that,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   "Oh, you know, it's okay."
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   But all it is is -- and it's good.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   It's end-to-end encrypted group chat.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   It's like end-to-end encrypted group chat not from Facebook is it's selling point --
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   plus AI, I forgot.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   Plus AI.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   -- plus AI.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   -- Yeah, it's -- I'll tell you that.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   -- I had to have one cut.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.300]   -- I swear it in it.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.300]   If John hands me -- if John pours me a drink, I'm going to drink it.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   So that's the --
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   -- and that's what a lot of people did.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   -- That's the problem.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.300]   -- That's who's in here is all of the -- you know, all Jason Snell,
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.300]   Merlin Mann, Glenn Fleichman.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   It's all the -- it's all the -- the Apple Mafia.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   So --
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   -- We're all in there.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.300]   It's interesting.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300]   I like that people are experimenting.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   I mean, this, you know, the -- the AI integration aside,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.300]   I think that instant messaging is really stagnated.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.300]   So I love that somebody's trying to figure out a way to do something that's not
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   a message or what's up, but, you know, or signal or something.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   There's just -- it's very -- but let me ask you this.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.300]   I'm an old person, I guess.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   John mentioned he's like -- he's in a bunch of group chats that have
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   hundreds of people in them alike.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   I'm in one with my family.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   I don't have any of these group chats.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   -- Well, that's what a number of people said is who wants that?
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.300]   -- Right.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.300]   -- Some people have this, though.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.300]   There's people who do this all the time or that it's kind of their social
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   thing as a -- instead of a Facebook group, it's a big group messaging
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.300]   -- That's when you should just open up your own Slack channel or your own Discord
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   or something like that, you know?
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   I want asynchronous.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   I don't want people dinging my phone.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.300]   Anyway, you know, it's fine.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   I wish you'd set up front.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   Hey, here's something I'm an advisor on and I'm getting compensated by.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   I wouldn't have read the 4,000 World article about it.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   -- I'm so --
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.300]   -- Okay.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   -- I did -- I did -- I joined it.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   Anyway, is our large-language models in six months or year?
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.300]   -- Yes.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   -- Will they be a laughing stock and not unlike --
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   -- I keep asking this question.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.300]   -- I have asked it on almost every show in the two weeks since chat GPT-4 came out.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   -- Is this a parlor trick?
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   Or is this as many of said, including Bill Gates, who said this is the biggest thing
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   that happened in computing since the graphic user interface?
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   -- But then he also said that his former company was ridiculous to say that it had hints of --
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   -- It's not AGI.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   -- It's not AGI.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   -- It's not.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   -- It's not.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.300]   -- It's not.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   -- And I think there's a lot of reasons to say maybe it never will be.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   But I think it is -- it's in -- look how many startups?
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   If you go search -- I don't know what it is like on the Google Play Store --
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   but if I search the Apple iOS App Store for AI, there's dozens of apps that are taking
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   the chat GPT API and making, you know, $2 apps.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.300]   -- So what's your answer?
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   -- Parlor Trick or no?
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   -- Or Revolution?
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   -- I don't know.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   That's why I keep asking that question.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   What do you think, Glenn?
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   Fresh meat?
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   -- I think it's a -- I think it's a fad.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   I think it's a fad.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   -- And it's a fad.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   -- Amen.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.300]   -- But it'll break apart.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.300]   Like, do you remember Segway?
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   I've been on these shows too often.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.300]   Segway was supposed to change the way cities were built, and it turned out to be a really
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.300]   good vehicle for meter readers and reticots.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   -- And mall cots.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   -- Yeah, a mall cots.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   But Segway is actually a kind of extraordinary thing, and I think it gave rise to the whole
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.300]   -- I own two at home.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.300]   -- Do you?
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   -- The thing that kills Segway is the same thing that killed the Google Glass, which is
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   you look like an ass on it.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   -- You're like a giraffe.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.300]   You're eight feet tall, zipping around.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.300]   It's very dumb.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   But I think it actually gave rise to the -- what do they call the hoverboards that burst into
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.300]   flame, and then that generation gave rise to the actual --
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   -- There you go.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   -- Right.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   But then that gave rise to the generation of battery powered scooters that are actually
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   pretty cool, and the unicycle self-balancing wheels around Seattle.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:34.300]   So ultimately, it was not -- the promise of the Segway wasn't revealed as all cities are
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   going to change to build around it.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   But electric bikes, electric scooters, I think it did prompt a rethinking about modes of electric
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   powered and sometimes self-balancing transportation.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.300]   -- You think because you live in Seattle?
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   -- Just on a generalize.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   -- You have a slightly warped point of view over this.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   -- Wait, doesn't everybody ride a self-balancing?
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   -- I see the Maroque's doing.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   -- I see the Maroque's doing.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   -- It's very strange.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   I do think you ride that all over Santa Rosa.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   -- Yeah.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.300]   -- Yeah, there's a certain type of young man who likes to ride those.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.300]   But I do see e-bikes everywhere.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   In fact, it's just an article that e-bikes are really catching on.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   -- You've got a bunch of US.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   -- And you have Segways and e-bikes, and you're asking about GPT's future.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   -- But you know why e-bikes were acceptable in Segways?
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   You look like you're a normal person because you're riding a bicep.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.300]   -- Oh, yeah.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   True.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.300]   -- Or a scooter, right?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   Even electric powered scooter is at some level.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   It's different than a Segway, obviously, but it has a similar functionality.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   So, so chat GPT, I don't think in all the AI-based chat things, how useful are they?
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   In a general sense, I think not that much, but I think this is kind of like, what was the Apple Watch?
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.300]   I don't know what Apple didn't know what it was.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   It turned out it's for fitness.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:46.300]   I think chat interactive AI models will wind up being useful for some specific stuff that's like,
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.300]   as a reporter, I'll tell you, and there's so many people in jobs where they have to do this scut work.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   And the scut work is just kind of putting stuff into forums and kind of doing this thing.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   It's computer, it's automated work that computers can't precisely do.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   And I could see a roll for, write me the form letter, an outline, and put in the blanks for blah.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   And it would produce something relatively original, it wouldn't be boring, and I'd go in and fill those blanks in.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   That seems like a perfectly reasonable use because it doesn't have to eliminate gazillions of jobs, is it?
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   No, it's augmentation.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   It makes you a little more efficient.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   You're better at your job.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   It takes you less time.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   It's less frustrating.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.300]   It increases loyalty to a job.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   It lets you do higher level work.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   All of the things that robotics did.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   I put that along the same lines of creators using AI to just do some repetitive tasks a little bit more efficiently and faster.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.300]   Not necessarily taking away their job, if you will.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   I'm totally impressed with what people are doing with mid-journey and stable diffusion.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   Oh yeah.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   I think we're going to see video created by this stuff.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   But it's Richard Camel, I think you had the most salient point of view, one of our hosts on Windows Weekly.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.300]   He said, "We are in the Gartner hype cycle."
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   This is the graph that shows the Gartner hype cycle.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:04.300]   We're at the beginning of a technology trigger on our way up to the peak of inflated expectations.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.300]   How long before we reach that peak?
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   Then there's the trough of disillusionment.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   Where everybody goes, "Oh yeah, we over-hyped this BS."
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   Then there is a little bit of a long tail.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   I think this is what you're talking about with the Segway.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   Where you reach not quite as inflated a hype, but the plateau of productivity.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   After a while, there is some value to this.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.300]   I think that's actually fairly accurate.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   We get ready.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   Richard said, "In a couple of months, we'll be hitting the trough of disillusionment."
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   I think that's probably the answer.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.300]   Haven't we done that already?
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.300]   We've gone the peak in the trough several times with it.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   It's like, "Oh, it's trying to steal Kevin Russe from his wife."
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   Maybe it's not that bad.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   You're right.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   Yeah, I don't know where exactly we...
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   Maybe that letter is part of the peak of inflated expectations as much as anything else.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   It's the rule of disillusionment.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   But there's clearly some value to it.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   Google has released Bard.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   If you guys had a chance to play with Bard, it came out before our show last week.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   But I hadn't asked more limited.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   It's not impressive.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   It really is.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   And it's wrong.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   Who's the wrong word, I think?
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:22.300]   It just simply doesn't know a lot and gets it wrong as a result.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   Let me try your wordel prompt.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.300]   Do you know any five letter words?
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.300]   I'm going to have to get faster at typing.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   That's one of the revelations all of this is where the second...
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   Well, a computer could do that for you.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   I should actually dictate it, shouldn't I?
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   That's what I do at home.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   Yeah, it's you and the fifth letter is O.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   Let's see if it does a better job than chat GPT did.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   Was this GPT 3 or 5 or 4?
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   No, it was a 3.5.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   It was a big one.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   Some people have actually...
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   I have 4.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   I'll try 4 with this as well.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   I'm pretty sure that's chat GPT 3.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   Yeah, that's the early one.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   Do you know any five...
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.300]   Let me, while we're doing this, while we're waiting, let's go to chat.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   We're just doing the computer.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   GPT and I will set it to 4 and do the same thing.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   What's the basic fee for...
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.300]   I think it's 20 bucks a month or something.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   I ended up paying for a lot of these just so that we could use them on the shows.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.300]   Yes, one example of a five letter word that meets your criteria is gumbo.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   That's right.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   All right.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   But just one.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   Let's see if large...
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   He's a judge on this.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.300]   Oh, just from the corner.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   He gave us some Latin.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.300]   Wow.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.

[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.

[00:26:40.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.

[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.

[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.

[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   Oh, yeah, because that's an old word.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   Oh, yeah, because that is an interesting connection.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.300]   Because we know Wolfram Alpha has them.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   Yeah, because it's got the math.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300]   It's so hard to compose queries for Wolfram Alpha.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   I find it, yeah, I would love to actually agree.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   Use an easier tool to compose queries for a harder tool that's
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   hard to compose queries for a very strange, but it works,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.300]   then great.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   Another great one is Zapier, because Zapier can be used to
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   interesting.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   Yeah, there's a lot of potential with these plugins.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.300]   Well, it seems like there's a lot of frustration with tools that
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   we're promised more of.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   So there's some excitement about this because it seems it
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.300]   gives the veneer of working really well.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   So 10 years into Siri, Google Assistant and some other tools,
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.300]   some are better than others, but they're satisfying in various
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   ways.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   So being able to go to a tool that pretends to give you doesn't
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.300]   know it's pretending something that seems plausible, I think,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.300]   is like an endorphin response.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   You're like, ah, it gave me an answer.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.300]   Understood what I meant.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   It wasn't saying like, ah, you mean fig newtons or whatever the
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   new joke was.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   Egg freckles.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.300]   That was the new joke, right?
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.300]   Let us take a break, then we'll talk about the Internet archive.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.300]   Did we talk about that last week?
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   I can't remember.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.300]   I don't think we did.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   They lost their court case.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.300]   I have thoughts.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   Yes.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   I hope we did.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   I thought we did.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   You know, you have the same problem I have, Ant, which is I
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.300]   think we cannot remember.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   We have so many different shows.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   I know we talked about it on Twitter.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   Well, I think we talked about what's going to because some of
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.300]   us on those colonies.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   Internet archive.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   Too many shows.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   No, the judgment came out for Friday.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   No, we talked about the fact that it was, we now have a result.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   The judges.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.300]   Oh, now we have to result.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   Okay.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   We will also, that's talk about a pioneer of the technology
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   revolution past this past week.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   Two of them.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   Yes, two of them.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300]   And a TikTok ban.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.300]   Where does it stand these days?
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:52.300]   And the secret list of Twitter VIPs, none of which none, which
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   does not include any of us.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   None of us.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   None of us.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   None of us.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   None of us.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.300]   Cat-turd-to VIP.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   But he bounced that with AOC.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   Anyway, we'll talk about that.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   Lots more to come.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   It's so nice to have you.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   Mr. Glenn Fleischman.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   Glenn.fun.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   You know what I was going to do before the show today is look up
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   your appearance on Jeopardy.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   Your appearance is on Jeopardy.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   And play one of them.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   Are they are online anywhere?
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   Technically no, but they may be findable.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   So, so many pictures that are tamed.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   I know they would take a tab.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   They're pretty good.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   They've been doing more.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   I watched an episode of Jeopardy the night.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   We started watching it more regularly again recently where this
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   person started and you thought, wow, this is, she's doing
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   terribly.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   She is answering wrong.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   She's going into the negative.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   And then she staged a comeback I've never seen before and wound up
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   winning the episode.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   Then she lost, unfortunately, on the next because she missed a
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   daily double answer.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   But it's still an exciting show.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   It's funny.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.300]   I watch it every night.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   I watch two episodes as I row.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.300]   Here is Glenn.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.300]   You think of the curve.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   With $15,199.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.300]   Look at that.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   Was that the right answer in Final Jeopardy?
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   The correct answer.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   The answer, the question was, oh, the clue was something about,
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.300]   and I didn't know the answer.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   This is an inductive reasoning, right?
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   The clue was something about this city in Eastern Germany changed
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   its name or had a different name between 1955 and 1989.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   And I'm like, it's not Stalin.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   There was Stalin Grot.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   There was Leningrad.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.300]   I'm like, it has to be Karl Marx.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.300]   And it was Karl Marx thought, which is the city of Hemnitz is the
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   name that it had before and after that.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.300]   But so I just wrote, who is Karl Marx?
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.300]   And they're like, yep, that's it.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   You must have, you actually put a question mark after it, which
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.300]   is great.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.300]   You're not required to do that.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.300]   But okay.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.300]   Who is Karl Marx?
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.300]   Am I right?
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   Am I wrong?
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   It's not Stalin.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   It's not Lenin.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.300]   In my experience, watching Jeopardy, that is often the skill,
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   because they always throw, often throw in little clues in the way
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.300]   they phrase the question and stuff.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   So the skill of doing a little reasoning around it, even if you
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   don't know exactly the answer, is often enough to get you the
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   answer.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   I find.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   I'd say the last several years, the big change in the game is
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   betting strategy, as people have gone all in in the last seven
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   years, and I'm really understanding how to be a pro, not
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.300]   everyone, but the people who really win and win big know when to
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   bet and how much to bet and when to not, not answering when
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   you don't know the answer is a huge thing, but betting and
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.300]   strategically getting the daily doubles.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.300]   That's how you're seeing some of these seven, eight-day winners,
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   people winning hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   And I also noticed, thanks to Madam Mario, that people no longer
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   start at the top and go there down the category.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   He was, he really, he flouted tradition.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.300]   People were very upset that he would start with, I'll take
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.300]   Wisenheimers for a thousand, Alex.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.300]   And, and you can't, they haven't, this is, that's the, and it
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.300]   turns out you can.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.300]   In fact, it's a brilliant strategy because the doubles you
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   have already zer often in the middle, and you get them off the
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.300]   board if you don't know the answer.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   It's changed the way of the game.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   I don't think I could play.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   It's a faster and more numeric gameplay than I think it used to
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   be, but I think they're pulling in when they switched to all
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.300]   internet auditioning.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   I think they're pulling in wonkier people than they used to.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.300]   They sure look at what's coming through.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.300]   I just, I have to say, look at me.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   Look at the, no, I'm looking at the picture of you playing and
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   thinking, you know, that's a pretty good looking bunch there.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.300]   Nowadays, some pretty strange looking people in there.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   There's some more of those.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   You even put on a necktie.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.300]   Yeah, good.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   The weirdos should be playing Japanese.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.300]   People are out in their unicycles in Santa Rosa.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   Exactly.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.300]   Exactly.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   Playing hockey sack.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.300]   Do you play hockey sack?
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   Tell the truth.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   No, no, I'm not one of those kinds of Seattleites.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300]   You're not that guy.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   Our show today, I'm very happy to say brought to you by CDW and

[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   With some, needed to keep their workloads on-prem due to
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300]   organizational or regulatory requirements.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.300]   Maybe it could be a little challenging to organize and

[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   So it was a loss in court for the Internet Archive.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   We had Corey Doctorow briefly on Twitter on Sunday, and he was
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   pretty head up about all this.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   Really?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.300]   He has said as many as serve -- yeah, Corey, just a little bit.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.300]   He has said as many as serve that the publishers just like
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   libraries to go away.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.300]   But of course, libraries predate publishing.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.300]   Corey pointed out they literally predate books.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:33.300]   So I guess the Library of Alexandria is mostly papyrus.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   So there's not much they can do about it, but this was for these
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.300]   four book publishers a great opportunity for them to at least
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   take a chink out of the libraries.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   Hashette versus Internet Archive.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   New York Federal Court Judge heard the arguments on Monday of
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.300]   the week by Friday of last week.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   Judge John G. Kettle decided that the Internet Archive had done
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   nothing more than create derivative works, and so would have
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.300]   needed authorization from the book's copyright holders, the
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.300]   publishers, before lending them out through its National
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.300]   Emergency Library program.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.300]   So round one to the publishers.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   But of course, the Internet Archive will appeal -- this one's
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   not as supreme court.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.300]   I have no doubt about it.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.300]   In the Internet Archive --
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.300]   Well, I don't think so at all.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   Oh, you don't?
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   Why not?
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   I think it's extremely cut and dried.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.300]   And I think the judge's decision was actually correct as much as I
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.300]   love and respect the Internet Archive.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   They have no foot on which to stand with this, but they wanted
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.300]   to turn it into a broad -- I mean, look, nobody should defend
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   large publishers and their behavior in the marketplace or how
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.300]   they treat authors or how they treat libraries.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.300]   This is the problem.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   Like, they're not solitary characters, right, where you're
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.300]   like, "Hey, the publishers are great."
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.300]   Publishers win!
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   Yeah, we know.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.300]   They have their own set of problems and issues, and they've
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.300]   been the way in which they allow public libraries to lend e-books
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   is kind of ridiculous.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   I mean, there has to be some kind of fair balance, and they don't
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   want to strike it.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   But the Internet Archive flouted a well-established law and doing
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.300]   what they did, and there's no basis on which they did what they
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.300]   did, and the judge said it.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.300]   Now, what they pushed and what a lot of their advocates pushed
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.300]   all during the case was that publishers are going to use this
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.300]   to erode other rights, like Google Books, Happy Trust's
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   abilities, one in court, to scan and offer snippet views and
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.300]   maintain private databases, like libraries, the right of the
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.300]   first lending right -- or the first -- I'm sorry, what's that
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.300]   call?
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.300]   It's the right -- when in the United States, when you purchase a
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.300]   book, you can do whatever you want with it once you own it.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.300]   If you have a first sale book, you can sell it to the first sale
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.300]   of it.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.300]   Yeah, that doctrine -- the judge said, no, that doctrine is
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.300]   totally intact.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.300]   This doesn't imply the fair use right that the Google Books and
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.300]   Happy Trust's lawsuit established, he didn't wave it away, but he
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.300]   explained how previous decisions that enlarged and codified fair
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.300]   use and enlarged and codified the first sale doctrine all stood
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   in place and how the Internet archives specific attempts fell
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   outside it and failed to justify even what they were
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.300]   maintaining.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.300]   So I think it was a weak suit because they were zoning into
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.300]   more book copies than they had one.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   Well, no, because there's no established right to convert an
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.300]   electronic copy -- a physical copy into an electronic copy and
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.300]   loan it.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.300]   That was one.
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.300]   That's their digital lending right issue, which does not have a
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.300]   basis in the law.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   So Congress could extend the law to allow that.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   They would -- could lobby for that and make that happen.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   It might be a good thing to do depending on a lot of factors.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   And they did not have the right to loan unlimited copies during
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.300]   when they established an emergency during the pandemic.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.300]   Were those social goods -- yes, do I love the Internet
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.300]   archive?
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   Yes, do I think it's legal and within the regulatory structure?
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   No, and I don't think the judge was wrong.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   I think allowing publishers to engage in predatory practices with
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.300]   libraries instead of having, you know, a lot of industries in
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   the music recording industry, there are a lot of statutory rights
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   that force things like, you know, any band -- Leo, you could
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   start the, you know, a tribute band and record any song you want
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   as a cover.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.300]   That's statutorily protected and there's a amount of money you
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   have to pay.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   The original public -- the person who wrote the music wrote the
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   song that lyrics and music.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   But there's no similar rights for libraries.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   So you could argue -- you know, in Europe, if you bar -- if you
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.300]   libraries in Europe have to pay specific fees that go to
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.300]   authors for subsequent lending rights, and it kind of obviates
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   this whole issue.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   So what I understand -- correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.300]   What I understand the Internet Archive did.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.300]   And I agree with you.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   In fact, we had Stephen Levy and Alex Cantor, which on Twitter
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.300]   a couple of weeks ago, and they argued, as you did, that the
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.300]   Internet Archive overstepped its authority.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   What the Internet Archive does or did, they would be either
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   given books, old worn out books from libraries or buy books.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.300]   I think in the most cases it was -- they were given books by
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.300]   libraries.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.300]   Physical copies, which they could have as a regular library
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   would lend out.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   But instead they decided to scan those.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.300]   And at least initially what they did is they lend them out just
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:24.300]   as libraries lend out sanctioned e-books, one book per reader.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.300]   In other words, they wouldn't have 14 copies of the same digital
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.300]   book.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   Now, there was the emergency actor in COVID where they said we're
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   not going to have those limits.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.300]   I think that's what they did.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.300]   That's what they got in trouble for.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.300]   But I do believe that the publishers also -- and the judge
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.300]   agreed -- did not want them to scan physical books and then
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   lend those out.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   Those were considered derivative works much like a
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   cover band would be a derivative work and was not allowed.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:59.300]   The problem is that is a method that is in response to the
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:03.300]   fact that major publishers don't actually offer digital
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.300]   books for purchase to libraries.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:12.300]   They have very high licensing fees and they rent them.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.300]   It's very restrictive.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:18.300]   So there is no way to get digital books in the same way you
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   get print books for libraries.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   That's one.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.300]   The publishers haven't given them a means to do that.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   There's also the issue of book banning and censorship.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.300]   And I think there's a public interest in not only preserving
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.300]   these physical books by digitizing them but also lending them
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:39.300]   out in cases where they're banned in jurisdictions.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   And lending them out electronically means that somebody who can't
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   read a book and some kid that can't read a book in Florida can
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   borrow it from the Internet Archive.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   And I think there's a societal mandate to allow that.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   Okay, I understand the publishers don't like it.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   Corey's point is publishers aren't going to, they're not
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.300]   losing any money with these lending.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.300]   Any more than, you know, they've always claimed that libraries
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.300]   cost authors and publishers money.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   And Corey, I think, is pretty adamant that that's not the case.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.300]   You disagree.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   Well, I don't think libraries don't cost authors money but the
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:18.300]   digital lending right surely did because even before the
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.300]   their emergency period that they declared, the Internet Archive
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.300]   didn't put strong protection on the book.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.300]   So they were loaning and this is a whole issue at DRM in books
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.300]   but a loan versus a purchase.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   When I purchase something, I find DRM offensive because I feel
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   like I've bought it and often in a way that should allow me to use it.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:40.300]   You know, and so on the movie side Internet or the, what's it
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.300]   called, movies everywhere?
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.300]   What's the system called that allows you?
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.300]   Movies everywhere, yeah.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.300]   Yeah, I mean that system actually broke some of the DRM issues by
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.300]   allowing you to use movies you purchased on a platform, you
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   can link them across all your devices and platforms.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.300]   That sort of diffused some of that issue which are in building
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   for a long time.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.300]   It gave you a more legitimate ability to work with an DRM system.
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.300]   I think there's a lot of ill use of DRM and I know Corey has
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.300]   written about that for decades and I don't think he's wrong about a
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.300]   lot of it.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.300]   But when you borrow or loan something, when it's meant to be a
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.300]   fixed period of time, I think it's acceptable to have DRM be one of
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   the things that controls lending and the Internet Archives DRM
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   controls on its digital lending right were not strong.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:25.300]   And then to allow an unlimited borrowing of any number of
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.300]   copies of books during the period, the self-declared emergency period
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   also is a taking, right?
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.300]   And so from an intellectual property standpoint, does this hurt?
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   I mean, does it hurt authors when people can go to the Internet
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.300]   Archive and get an unlimited number of books for an extended period
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   of time and in some cases if they do a very simple thing can retain
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.300]   that book forever, I think it's pretty clear it does.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   The judge could have.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   He could have.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.300]   He's not a generalist.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   And I think maybe should have said, okay, that emergency
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   lending thing, that was not okay.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   But I really did want the judge to uphold the first sale doctrine
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.300]   and said.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.300]   Which he did.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.300]   He did.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.300]   But you can't digitize it.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.300]   Oh, for physical only.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   So if I bought a book, I can't scan it.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.300]   You can scan it for personal use.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.300]   You can possess it.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   You can do any transfer more, transformatory act.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   You want the privacy of your home and among a household as you
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   know, a lot of people make sense.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300]   You know, speaking of Craig Newman, right?
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.300]   I was in the Newman V or the replay TV lawsuit.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:27.300]   I was a Newman V and I was one of the non named co-plaintiffs of
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:32.300]   that lawsuit when a lot of like 29 different studios were trying
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:37.300]   to prevent fast forwarding of ads as something because replay T&V
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.300]   enabled it.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.300]   Yeah, I was.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   Yep.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.300]   It was EFF pursued model litigants or model plaintiffs and or
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.300]   and I was one of them.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   So we entered that lawsuit and it was settled.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.300]   So we didn't get a definitive answer, but it's the same principle as,
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.300]   you know, can you fast forward in the privacy of your home?
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   Well, cable company or sorry, a studio executive said, well,
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.300]   there might be acceptable pausing for using the bathroom like you're,
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.300]   but you're obliged to watch the ads, right?
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.300]   It's a maybe you can go take a break.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.300]   It's the same kind of thing here where it's in the privacy of your home.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   If you want to scan a book or transform a book, that's fine.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   And Google and other organizations like that libraries,
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   the happy trust, which is a kind of association that represents
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.300]   hundreds and hundreds of academic libraries and institutional libraries.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.300]   Valuable to my research.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.300]   Well, in fact, the courts.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   They can scale that as fair use.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   Exactly.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.300]   Because a machine was reading it, not a human.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   Exactly.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.300]   You're not making it all.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.300]   It doesn't lessen the value.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   It does.
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.300]   It's not a taking.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.300]   Let me read what the let me read with the EFF says.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.300]   For publishers sued the archive alleging that this controlled digital lending
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.300]   violates their copyrights has shed HarperCollins, Wiley and Penguin
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.300]   Random House claims CDL has cost their companies millions of dollars
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.300]   and is a threat to their business.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.300]   This is the EFF writing.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.300]   They are wrong.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   Libraries have paid publishers billions of dollars for the books in their print collections
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:05.300]   and are investing enormous resources in digitization in order to preserve those texts.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.300]   CDL helps ensure the public can make full use of the books the libraries have bought
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.300]   and paid for.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   This activity is fundamentally the same as traditional library lending
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:18.300]   and poses no new harm to authors or the publishing industry.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   Libraries have never been required to get permissions or pay extra fees to lend books.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:29.300]   And as a practical matter, the data shows that the CDL, the data shows that the CDL has not
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   and will not harm the publishers bottom mind.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.300]   I agree with you.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.300]   There's this gray area over the uncontrolled lending.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:42.300]   But I don't understand why it's any different for the library,
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.300]   whether it's a Boston Public Library, which does this, or the Internet Archive,
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   to scan a physical copy and lend that out one book per digital copy, one lender,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.300]   one reader per digital copy.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.300]   That seems to me the same thing.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.300]   That seems to be very fair.
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   If you if you maintain that limitation.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.300]   I don't think Glenn agrees.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.300]   I don't agree because I think you have to have strong DRM in the Internet Archive didn't have it.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.300]   And I think you have to.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.300]   I also think it's not established in law.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.300]   So should there be such a right?
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.300]   I actually think there should.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.300]   Even further, I think the European model is what we should be adopting,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.300]   which is that libraries should have should be paying.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.300]   I'm not trying to take money out of libraries budgets, but instead of having this broken
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:29.300]   ebook model where publishers charge ridiculous amounts and limit the lending to like 29 times ever
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.300]   for an ebook, things like that.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.300]   Libraries should instead be using the licensing model.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:39.300]   The European market involves, which requires payments every time books are lent out and
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.300]   that they go to authors and publishers.
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.300]   And that allows the removal of a whole overlay.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.300]   It means that there's fair payment, but it doesn't involve this.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.300]   Incredible.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   It's not sure by publishers.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.300]   Completely.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.300]   No, no, because libraries are paying these fees.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.300]   They're paying these fees in terms of ebook lending right now, which is the broken system.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:05.300]   And the whole point here is, and this is, Corey is always arguing this, that somehow because
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:12.300]   something's digital doesn't change the fundamental copyright issue, but publishers who hate the
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.300]   whole idea of libraries would love to say, as you are, oh, now that it's digital, we have
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   to have DRM, we have to have licensing, we have to have fees.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.300]   I completely disagree.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:30.300]   The EFF also disagrees.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:35.300]   They say copyright law does not prevent that lawful fair use.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   Indeed, it supports it.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   Libraries are simply striving to serve their patrons effectively and efficiently.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.300]   Lending books one at a time, just as they've done for centuries, the fact that it's digital
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.300]   versus print should make no difference.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   Now, I do agree with you.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   You're probably right.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.300]   This won't make it the Supreme Court, even though I'm sure in an archive will appeal it
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   to copyright holders have, I think, undue disproportionate influence in this society.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:07.300]   But this undermines how libraries work fundamentally.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   It's wrong.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.300]   I don't think it undermines it at all because it puts us back into the status quo ante in
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   which libraries are doing exactly what they've been doing.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   I think it reaffirms the publisher's position, which I think is predatory, that I don't
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   like.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   I think libraries, instead of the Internet Archive, are attempting to stake out an untenable
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.300]   position, which they did, which a law doesn't support, that they should be working to get
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.300]   reform.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.300]   I mean, the endless extension of the copyright law.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.300]   There is disagreement over whether the law supports it or not.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.300]   So that's...
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   Well, let me ask you a hypothetical.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.300]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.300]   Because I looked up the library, the leader of the archive, and they said they need some
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.300]   books, and I was looking up for this purpose.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   I was looking up to see if I had to get them, and they didn't need my books.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   A library has to...
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.300]   I think full retail for a physical book.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.300]   Right?
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.380]   Is there anything in first sale that prevents me from giving the library a copy of a book
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.300]   so they don't have to pay for it, and they can then lend that out?
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   Right?
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   No, not at all.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   Right?
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   That's the other principle to work here.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   Right.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.300]   Is that number one?
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.620]   Number two, I think that what needs to get challenged is that when I buy an Audible book,
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:17.300]   which I do a lot, I can't give it to someone else, even with the URL.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   Yeah, this is the publisher.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.300]   That's wrong.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.300]   I can't give it to the Kindle book.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   Because now that it's digital, we can retrain the agreement.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.300]   They've rewritten first sale doctrine in these new areas.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.300]   They hate first sale doctrine.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.300]   They want to charge for every...
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   There should be a transfer.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.300]   There should be a copy of the book.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.300]   Yes, there should be.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.300]   But there should be able to transfer...
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   If I could transfer my ebook ownership to someone else, I would feel very differently about publishers.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.300]   And I can't...
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.300]   I'll tell you back when...
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   Do you remember when iTunes was introduced, I was interviewing Phil Schiller.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.380]   This is what 2005 or '04?
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.300]   And this is when everything else was you had to buy...
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.260]   It was all this protection and downloads, a very complicated music system.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.060]   And Phil said to me, "Unlike these other systems, when you buy a song from Apple, you own it."
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.300]   And I said, "Oh, can I sell it to somebody else?"
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.300]   And he said, "No."
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.300]   I'm like, "Well, then I don't own it."
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.300]   Right?
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.300]   Oh, no.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.300]   It's a license.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   And that's the thing.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.700]   If I buy an ebook, I'm not really buying it.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.700]   It's a license.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.340]   And I always, I've always agreed with Corey on that.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.900]   The same token, if I buy a physical book, am I buying the rights to reproduce it electronically
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:23.140]   or in a form I'm not under the current law, should I be able to?
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   Probably, right?
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:29.020]   Congress should copyright be endless, should libraries be subject to the same strictures
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.700]   that individual purchases are?
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   There's a lot of change that should happen.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.820]   And I don't think this was the mechanism that allows that.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.900]   I think it actually...
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.260]   It did reaffirm publishers' positions, but it also means that we really have to go to
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.580]   the legislature and get changes made.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.580]   Is it possible?
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.300]   I don't know if it is, but I think that's the route that would actually produce a lasting
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.380]   and change without requiring a lawsuit after lawsuit.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380]   All right.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.380]   Let's take a little break.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.700]   When we come back, there's more to talk about.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.700]   That's a great subject.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:00.100]   You, by the way, are in the same campus, Stephen Levy and Alex Cantor, it's all three of you
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   authors.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.220]   Corey's an author, Jeff, you're an author.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:10.220]   I have no books in this hunt, but I think libraries are one of the two.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.820]   I love any book I sell.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   Good for you.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820]   Good.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   Awesome.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   Your publisher might.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.820]   And Corey, actually, Corey has a...
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.820]   I'm the publisher.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.260]   There you go.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:28.260]   Corey has a new Kickstarter, by the way, and I love the title of the Kickstarter.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.460]   Red Team Blues, another audiobook that Amazon won't sell.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:41.260]   And his point is because he will not put DRM on his audiobooks, Amazon, i.e. Audible,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.620]   will never carry his audit.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.540]   And I said, "Well, really, isn't that a case of you not letting them carry it?"
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.780]   He said, "No, because they insist on DRM."
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.580]   He's the license holder.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.780]   He's the publisher in this case, and he's not letting them...
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.180]   Okay, Corey.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:00.540]   But no, his point is well taken, and it is the longest URL I've ever seen on a Kickstarter.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.660]   But you know what easiest thing to do, go to Kickstarter.com, search for Red Team Blues.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.100]   Looks like a really great book.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.500]   This is Corey's bid to own a James Bond-like series.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:16.100]   His hero in the book is a certified public accountant.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:21.220]   And Marty Hinch knows where Silicon Valley's bodies are buried.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.380]   He's a hard-charging forensic accountant, a gentleman of a certain age who spent the
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:31.420]   past 40 years unwinding every finance scam in Silicon Valley.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.700]   If we can just make him a little younger and sexier, Corey, I think we could have
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   movie rights sold.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700]   I'm just saying.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.900]   I'm just saying.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.460]   I see maybe one of the Hemsworth brothers.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.620]   I'm just saying, can we make him a little younger?
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.380]   Red Team Blues on Kickstarter.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.540]   We will be back in a moment.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.540]   Hey, everybody.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540]   Leo LaPorte here.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:56.980]   The founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast network.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:02.060]   I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit, because I think it's unique.
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:09.820]   And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech audience, you
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.860]   need to know about what we do here at Twit.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:19.180]   We've built an amazing audience of engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners who listen
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.940]   to us and trust us when we recommend a product.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:28.340]   Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:34.660]   Already, your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged is good for you.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.060]   Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.820]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820]   world.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.860]   And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.860]   We are very careful.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:56.980]   We pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity and introduce them
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:02.180]   to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:06.220]   And that makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:14.340]   We are literally bringing you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:19.020]   We like to create partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.100]   run, long term partners that want to grow with us.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.580]   And we have so many great success stories.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   Tim Broome, who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one, has
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.620]   been with us ever since.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:38.540]   He said, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit network."
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.940]   I think the proof is in the pudding.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:45.980]   Others like ITProTV and Audible that have been with us for more than 10 years, they stick
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.340]   around because their ads work.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.340]   And honestly, isn't that why you're buying advertising?
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.540]   You get a lot with Twit.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.980]   We have a very full service attitude.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:01.300]   We almost think of it as artisanal advertising, boutique advertising.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:05.180]   You'll get a full service continuity team.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:09.420]   People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you with
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.740]   everything from copywriting to graphic design.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.340]   So you are not alone in this.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.100]   We embed our ads into the shows.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.140]   They're not added later.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.460]   They're part of the shows.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:25.940]   In fact, often, they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:30.020]   the ad saying, "Yeah, I love that," or "Just the other day."
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.260]   One of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that."
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:38.180]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.060]   saying, "Yeah, that sounds great."
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.060]   We deliver, always over-deliver on impressions.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.420]   So you know you're going to get the impressions you expect.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.380]   The ads are unique every time.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.220]   We don't pre-record them and roll them in.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.220]   We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.700]   We'll give you great onboarding services, ad tech with pod sites that's free for direct
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.700]   clients.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:05.020]   It gives you a lot of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.140]   You'll get courtesy commercials where you actually can take our ads and share them across social
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.740]   media and landing pages that really extends the reach.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:16.420]   There are other free goodies, too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter that sent
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:20.900]   to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   We give you bonus ads and social media promotion, too.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:31.740]   So if you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to a savvy, engaged tech audience.

[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.380]   Check out those testimonials.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.540]   Mark McCrary is the CEO of Authentic.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:43.380]   You probably know him, one of the biggest original podcast advertising companies.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.660]   We've been with him for 16 years.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:52.740]   Mark said the feedback from many advertisers over 16 years across a range of product categories.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.460]   Everything from razors to computers is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.300]   a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.740]   I'm very proud of what we do because it's honest.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:04.740]   It's got integrity.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.020]   It's authentic.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:11.980]   And it really is a great introduction to our audience of your brand.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.780]   Our listeners are smart.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.780]   They're engaged.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.220]   They're tech savvy.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.300]   They're dedicated to our network.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.580]   And that's one of the reasons we only work with high-integrity partners that we've personally
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.900]   and thoroughly vetted.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.740]   I have absolute approval on everybody.

[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.780]   So give us a ring.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.220]   Now we're back and it's time to talk TikTok.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.980]   Do we have a TikTok corner, Jeff?
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   No.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.620]   Do we have a TikTok corner?
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:11.140]   TikTok in its testimony, the CEO of TikTok, testified.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.140]   This could be your number.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.940]   I don't want to steal your number.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:22.740]   The hashtag #TikTokBan had 1.7 billion views on Monday.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.100]   As of Monday, yeah.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.660]   As of Monday.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:30.220]   He also said, and I don't have the number in front of me, but he said a rather large number
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.780]   for the number of videos they take down every day.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:41.780]   It wasn't the, at least millions if not billions, for a variety of reasons that they are trying
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:48.700]   really hard to keep people safe on TikTok.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:54.580]   But I don't think lawmakers or state governments really care about the hashtag.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.580]   They don't.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.580]   TikTok.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.580]   Line 59.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.940]   I could have one thing here from TikTok, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.020]   A random, oh, I think I know which stupid.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.620]   Is this the Wi-Fi moment?
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620]   This is actually, it's not.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.620]   No, this is different.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.580]   That was another random stupid moment.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.580]   Let's see.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.340]   Yeah, that was hilarious.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:19.740]   That was the one where a member of Congress asked you, the CEO of TikTok, do you attach
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.860]   to my Wi-Fi?
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:26.460]   And he said, well, yeah, when your app's at home, can you see my Wi-Fi?
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   Yeah, that's how it works.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.900]   Well, I rest my case, Yana.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.380]   Okay, here's another one.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.740]   It's a series of tubes.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.620]   It's a bunch of tubes and you have to.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.940]   He has a Mr. TikTok into the tube.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.700]   Mr. Carter from Georgia, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.340]   Oh, my sound has turned off.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.340]   I always do that.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.340]   Hold on a second.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.340]   I got to do this right.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:54.300]   Here, every juicy adverb coming out of this member of Congress, and press the button.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300]   Do the thing.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   Here we go.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.980]   I want to talk specifically, can you tell me right name?
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:06.180]   Can you say with a hundred percent certainty that TikTok does not use the phone's camera
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:13.620]   to determine whether the content that elicits a pupil dilation should be amplified by the
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.620]   algorithm?
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.620]   Can you tell me that?
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.940]   We do not collect body, face or voice data to identify our users.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:20.940]   They don't need to.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.540]   They just say, how long do you watch it?
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.100]   Hello, you're on the screen.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.140]   I think you like this bikini-rich content.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   Dilation.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.100]   More thirst traps.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.940]   You don't know.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.980]   The only face data that you get that we collect is when you use the filters to have
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.700]   safe sunglasses on your face, we need no way eyes are.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.420]   Why do you need to know when the eyes are?
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.500]   If you're not seeing, is they're dilated?
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500]   And the data is called on your local devices.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.500]   Oh my gosh.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.660]   If you use it for facial skin, it's like you just need to have a nice body, face or voice
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.580]   data to identify our users.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.940]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.260]   Oh, well, there you go.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.260]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.260]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.260]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.260]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.260]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.620]   You know, I think someone has a big race is the time or two as well.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.620]   But were they?
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.620]   Was there racist as them as well?
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:08.620]   Really?
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.140]   Well, I mean, a couple of times, because I'm bouncing an eye to evidence, sort of pissed
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   me off.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.140]   It was making me so angry I turned it off.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.460]   They kept sort of referring to him as if he's Chinese.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.460]   He's from Singaporean.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.660]   And he went to Harvard for Christ's sake.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.740]   And I want to say at one point, he was like, "Hey, sir, I'm Singaporean.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.780]   I want to say that at least once."
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.220]   Well, you look like your Chinese.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.860]   I was like, "Wow."
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.500]   Well, I think that you could say.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.860]   You could say, "Kuetl silver."
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.460]   So, too much what?
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.460]   "Kuetl silver."
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.460]   "Kuetl silver."
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.340]   Yes, that's great for the health.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   Apparently, this is not a recommendation.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   It's one of these right-wing things that people do.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.020]   They drink kuetl silver.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.020]   Some people have turned blue.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:49.580]   Haven't you seen the pictures of people?
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.580]   Right.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   It's not...
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.580]   I thought you said...
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.220]   I had a whole different picture on it.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.620]   Because I thought you said kuetl silver.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:58.620]   And that's another...
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.620]   No, no, not kuetl silver.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.620]   Kuetl silver.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.620]   Kuetl silver.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.620]   Kuetl silver.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.620]   Kuetl.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.620]   Antigotchuchus.
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.620]   You did.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.620]   Good poor, sir.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.620]   Okay.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.620]   Good poor.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:12.220]   Third part of the country, no more than others have out.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.260]   I mean, in some ways you could say that the whole TikTok thing is racist because it's
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.260]   about...
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.260]   It's...
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.260]   If it weren't Chinese...
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.260]   Chinese.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.260]   Right?
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.260]   I mean, xenophobic at the least.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.260]   It's xenophobic, yeah.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.820]   Could have had Snap and Instagram and TikTok all up there.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.820]   Should have.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   It's live.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.180]   Should have been the only thing I heard sensible coming from some of the members of Congress
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:34.100]   was we need a law, a privacy law.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.100]   Look.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.340]   And whose job is that?
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:38.340]   So, do it.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:40.340]   I...
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:45.700]   You know, a lot of what they were asking of Chiu was to do things that they're not asking
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.260]   Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all the others.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.180]   And I think his point was, well, yeah, we could do that, but it would put us a huge
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.460]   competitive disadvantage.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:00.900]   And I think this really underscores the fact that this is what Facebook wants.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:01.900]   This is exactly...
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.900]   This is...
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.540]   I wouldn't be surprised at all if...
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:08.380]   You know, Mark Zuckerberg weren't whispering into these members of Congress ears.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.260]   Hey, you know, you should really do some of that TikTok.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.380]   They're really not lunch.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   Twitter's source code has been hanging around in public for months.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:24.900]   Leaked online, Elon Musk has gone to GitHub saying, "Who did that?"
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:32.820]   Probably I'm guessing a disgruntled former employer, Twitter was able to get the source
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:38.940]   code pulled off GitHub on Friday with a copyright infringement notice.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:43.580]   It's unclear how long, according to the New York Times, the leaked code have been online,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.980]   but it appears to have been public for at least several months.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:52.140]   I was just showing up for someone to fix it.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.180]   Twitter asked the US District Court for the Northern District of California to order GitHub
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.860]   to identify the person who shared the code.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:02.700]   And everybody who downloaded it.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.820]   Elon's coming to your house, kids.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.820]   Come on over.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.260]   Let's have a beer.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.260]   But that's it.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.220]   One concern, of course, is code includes security vulnerabilities that could give hackers or
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:23.500]   other motivated partners the means to extract user data or take down the site.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.740]   Actually, I don't think...
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.740]   I don't think...
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.740]   The same thing worse you could...
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:27.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.740]   I don't think there's any worse you could do to Twitter with their source code.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.740]   Exactly.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:30.740]   Yeah, the same thing.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.740]   They've been self-imposed.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:38.780]   And in fact, I think the Armageddon is probably coming on Saturday.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.620]   Oh, really?
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:46.220]   Well, April 1st, Elon has said that we are going to start removing blue checks from everybody
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.220]   who doesn't pay.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.220]   Right?
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.460]   April Fool's Day.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:56.700]   And if you don't have a blue check, you won't ever be shown in the for you column.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.220]   You won't be able to participate in polls.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:07.500]   And it's been kind of implying that if you have the blue check, your posts will be boosted.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.340]   So honestly, I mean, I don't know who's still on Twitter.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.380]   Apparently quite a few people.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:18.780]   But isn't this going to make it just be unusable?
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:19.780]   Maybe not.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.980]   People seem to really not want to leave Twitter.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.380]   They really don't want to leave Twitter.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.620]   It's a broadcast platform for some of us.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.860]   But if you don't have a blue check...
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.740]   You're going to pay them an eight bucks a...
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.260]   No, I'm not paying them squat.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.260]   So you won't be a very good...
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.260]   I'll be a very good...
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.260]   It won't be as good as I do.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:40.740]   If I don't say it's being useful for me, then no, I'll dump it.
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.420]   Your impressions are going to be down, I would say.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.420]   Platform.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.060]   Because there's a bunch of things out there.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.900]   There's Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Vero, YouTube, whatever you want.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.300]   And you try them out.
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.300]   And if you don't feel like they're working for you, you just leave.
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.700]   And Twitter at the moment still works for me.
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.820]   And if it stops working for me, I won't put any more effort into it.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.860]   Because I know that that game has been fixed.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:10.140]   I do have to point out that Yes, Elon Musk does have a blue check.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.660]   But apparently it's as legacy.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.300]   It may never be not be notable.
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.300]   So...
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.820]   Oh man, he's too cheap to pay himself.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.820]   He's not even paying the eight bucks himself, kids.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.300]   Gotta sell some more house plants for the offices to for them.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.300]   Can you believe that?
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.820]   That's hilarious.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.660]   This is a legacy verified account.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.020]   It may or may not be notable.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:38.900]   By the way, I just want to point out, I have a better blue check than Elon does.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:43.020]   Because my blue check says this account is verified because it's notable in government
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.940]   news entertainment and other designated category.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:49.420]   So I guess I trump Elon.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:53.620]   But now I can't wait to get rid of my blue check because it's the mark of the eight bucks
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.620]   mark.
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.500]   Yeah, I'll be very intro.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.780]   I'm going to be on vacation when I lose my blue check.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.500]   I guess I should hope I lose it, right?
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.380]   Because I wonder if you'll even lose it though.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.380]   I bet I won't.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   Because again, it says you're notable.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.060]   Everybody's got a security line suck up then.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.140]   I did pay when Twitter blue first came out before Elon's acquisition.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   I did pay for it.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.140]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   I did too.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.140]   Okay, look, here's a...
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.140]   Okay.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.380]   So there's a new kind of blue check.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   This account is verified because it's subscribed to Twitter blue.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.380]   Right.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.740]   And I hate seeing it.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.940]   That's how that works.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.940]   So...
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:35.260]   What was the thing too is that the engineers are working on being able to let you suppress
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.820]   showing your check marks so people will think you're a schmuck.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.140]   Somebody saw this in the code.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.260]   It has not been confirmed, but somebody saw it in the code.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.940]   I love that there will be a setting that says, "I know.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.860]   I have the blue check, but I want anybody to see it."
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.860]   That's right.
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:53.100]   Didn't Elon want to make the whole thing egalitarian and no princes, no poppers?
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.420]   He didn't want anything like that.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.420]   That's not what he was.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   That's not.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.900]   Now, does he still want to open source the code?
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:21:59.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:02.500]   He promised it for the end of March, didn't he?
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.500]   He got sick.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.460]   He got pissed that some of it got leaked.
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.460]   That's why I asked.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.460]   It's like, "Oh, is that weird?"
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.460]   No, but they had said it.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.260]   He said, "I'm an open source, the algo."
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.260]   He said, "You may not like it.
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.260]   It's going to be ugly."
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.260]   Oh, that's right.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.660]   But at least you'll get to fix it, but the problem is he's fired everybody who knows how
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.900]   to do that, I think.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:24.620]   There's no engineering bandwidth to do what he wants to do.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:29.460]   He may also have realized open sourcing the algorithm is not a good idea, because that
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.540]   just means everybody can game it.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.940]   As soon as you know what gives you the top of the list, you game it.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:37.860]   You make sure you're in the top, right?
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.700]   Similar to what people have already been doing.
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.700]   Right.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.700]   You can help.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.980]   Yeah, apparently posting TikTok videos, then retweeting them and then commenting on them
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.420]   or something is the current best strategy.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.900]   Ryan Broderick's garbage day, he's been writing about how he's trying to figure out
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.980]   how people are gaming the system.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.220]   I think that's it.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:58.740]   It's like a video, but it's not the video that gets it.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.780]   It's a comment that "tweets it" that replies to it and those are the ones.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.020]   It's weird, but it's like- It makes total sense, though.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.020]   It's all engagement.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.780]   That makes total sense to me.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.380]   It's like, "Why were magicians all over Facebook for a while?"
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.420]   They figured out the magic of getting engagement there with those three-minute weird videos
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.100]   and the same things happening on Twitter.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.780]   It's going to get very weird over there.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:24.100]   Well, not for the Twitter VIPs.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:29.660]   Zoe Schiffer writing a platformer seems to have discovered the secret list of Twitter
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:36.980]   VIPs who get boosted over everyone else.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.460]   This I guess is a leak.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:46.780]   I'm not sure where she got it, but LeBron James, Ben Shapiro, Cat Turd 2, then to balance
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.340]   it out, AOC and Joe Biden.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:54.100]   Oh, I am a paid subscriber, but I guess I'm not signed in, so I'll have to go through
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.700]   that rigmarital.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.260]   I don't know.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.260]   What does that mean?
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.260]   There's a VIP list.
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:00.900]   Of course there is.
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.900]   There's always been a- Well, it's ridiculous.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:07.020]   Remember when Justin Bieber was huge on- He had his own server on Twitter because they
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.940]   had dedicated hardware, the Bieber servers.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.220]   I think that's always been the case.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.300]   So Anthony Nielsen says that I am not notable.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:26.780]   I'm only notable in my own mind that when he looks at it- Wow, Jabs.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.660]   So when I'm on private now, I'm not logged in.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.900]   It says this is a legacy verified account.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.500]   It may or may not be notable.
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.100]   So somehow, for some reason, Elon is showing me something different.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.940]   Dude, that's fascinating.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.940]   Well, that's weird.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:47.100]   Well, I mean, the Chief Twit called out the so-called Chief Twit, and that's what happens
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.100]   to you.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:53.420]   I think that maybe, because I'm not Elon, I'm seeing that, but when- I don't know.
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.420]   What is sort of weird- Well, I see.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.660]   I'm looking at my account right now.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:59.420]   I have a legacy verified account, and it says I'm a legacy verified account.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.900]   It doesn't say that I'm notable or not.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.540]   And you're logged in.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.540]   I'm logged in.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.540]   I don't.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.740]   I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't see.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.100]   He's sucking us into this stupid game.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100]   Who cares?
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.100]   Exactly.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:17.300]   Well, it'll just make a difference in how, you know, what happens- what's it going to
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:23.540]   be like when verification goes away because it's been a signal for people- so about credibility,
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   but it was something.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:29.700]   It was like you trusted people were who they said they were, and I did see, isn't for you
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.300]   is going to include people you follow, but then how are you going to find you're not
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.500]   going to be able to discover people who aren't paying to promote themselves, basically?
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:44.340]   And it seems to me, if you take away the blue checks from people who are actually verified,
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:48.900]   that we will be back to the way where it was when he first did this, and there was all
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:52.620]   that impersonation going on, right?
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.780]   So anyway- Those are fun times.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.380]   We shall find out Saturday.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.860]   Enjoy.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:06.660]   I will be not paying any attention whatsoever to that.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.660]   As you shouldn't.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.300]   I will be on vacation.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.580]   So all right, moving here.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.380]   I finally logged in by the way to platformer.
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.300]   Here's the rest of the list.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:26.100]   Mr. Beast, Mark Andreessen, weird Twitter pioneer at drill.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.820]   Do you know who that is, Jeff?
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:28.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.820]   Oh, you know who it is, Glenn.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.820]   Is it good or bad?
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:37.900]   He's a- Well, the guy was- There's a question whether drill got red-pilled, which is a very
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:42.860]   modern thing to say, which is drill is a- Not exactly a parody account.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.660]   It was a pseudonymous account, and the guy posted some of the funniest, most unhinged,
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.380]   like weird Twitter stuff for years and years.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:54.180]   But then at some point a few months ago, he started to post things that sounded suspiciously
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:02.020]   like maybe a slightly funnier or more tuned in Elon Musk, and people have felt like there's
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.780]   a whole conspiracy theory about the account that it was sold or that someone else taken
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:15.980]   over or the guy behind it has decided to go Musk or go Q. Who knows what?
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.740]   But it's got a very different tone.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:23.660]   He just used to post things that were incredible non-sequiturs, but like tap directly into like
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:30.060]   a very, very of the moment zeitgeist and we're just almost incomprehensible a week later.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.740]   It was incredible skill.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.740]   That's what Twitter was really good at, right?
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:35.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:36.740]   Things like that.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740]   So, horse ebooks.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   Horse ebooks?
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.220]   But I think as Andreessen has blocked virtually everybody.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.620]   I don't know why I got blocked by him, but I'm a lot of them.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:45.620]   Are you?
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.620]   I got blocked years ago.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.620]   No.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:53.620]   I think he blocked me in 1996 when I said that it was all over for Netscape.
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.940]   Once Internet Explorer 3 came out.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.940]   It's a very thin skinned man.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.860]   What is his, is it just Mark Andreessen?
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860]   What is his?
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860]   No, it's P. Marka.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860]   P. Marka.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860]   P. Marka.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.860]   Let me just see.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:08.860]   Marka.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.860]   See if I'm blocked.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.860]   No, I can see his stuff.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.860]   He hasn't blocked me.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:12.860]   Like to point out I always do this when I was doing this.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.860]   He follows me.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:14.860]   Look at that.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:15.860]   Hi, P. Marka.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   We used to be in conversations all the time.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.540]   Let's see what his, oh, this is a new thing, by the way.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:25.980]   When Calicannus was on a, a twit I had, I asked him, what's this all in thing next to your
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:26.980]   name?
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:29.060]   And that's the thing they pay for now.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.060]   That's the A60.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:33.140]   He's got the A16Z glyph.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.140]   That's his venture capital firm.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:41.700]   Calicannus had the all in glyph for, he tried to sell me and get a Twig lift, but no, I'm
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.700]   not going to purchase him.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.700]   I'm glad they're happy.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.300]   He didn't give me a price, but I think he was the best.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.700]   The fast noise in the month, isn't it?
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:48.700]   Isn't that the company price?
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.700]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700]   I don't know.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.700]   I don't know.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:52.700]   Oh, is that not corporate verification?
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.580]   You know, you have to wear a certain amount of flare, Leo.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.420]   You have to have 25 minutes of the flare.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.620]   That's just, it's just a recognition.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.620]   Some flare.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:04.500]   I just want to say on Mastodon, you have all the flare you want.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   No charge.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.500]   That's right.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.500]   Free flare.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.500]   Free flare.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.300]   And believe it, people use it.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:15.340]   That's a lot of flare up there on the Mastodon.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:20.340]   I just like to point out, every time Elizabeth Holm's gets the news, I like to point out
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.500]   the New York Times, was it the fashion section or something?
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:29.700]   We had a cover story written by Mark Andreessen's wife and Mark Andreessen had some connection
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:34.540]   to Theranos and was extolling Elizabeth Holm's as the future of everything.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.820]   And none of the entanglements were disclosed.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.820]   Oh, Lord.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.820]   So there you go.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.700]   All that little world talking to each other.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.420]   Also on the list, comedian Jabuki Young White.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.220]   Don't know who that is.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:53.700]   Tesla community account, Tesla owners SV and journalist, Matt Iglesias, Glenn Greenwald,
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.220]   Noah Smith and Adrian Wojanowski.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.820]   We put air quotes around journalism this case.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:05.220]   Platformers not publishing the full list whose makeup has changed slightly over time to protect
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:10.340]   our sources identities.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:14.740]   Friends where writer Derek Guy is also on the list.
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:17.580]   Which could be a guy?
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.260]   Hi, Guy.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.620]   Yeah, you know, I really have to force myself to do these stories.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.620]   I have not.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:31.220]   Because you haven't heard a lot of Facebook stories over the last couple of years.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.220]   Thank you.
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.780]   I feel the same way about Twitter at this point.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:39.940]   It's just so many people, including Jeff and Stacey are still, you know, Twitter users.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.460]   And I, so I feel like I guess I have to cover this.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.020]   I don't know.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.660]   It has its place, you know.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:47.660]   I guess.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660]   That's about how I look at it.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.220]   If Facebook has its place too, I'm not a Facebook user.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:56.300]   But again, I've mentioned before that I know a handful of users there were their business
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.500]   thrives because of Facebook connections.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.500]   I understand that.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.220]   Don't shoot yourself in the foot.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:07.540]   When we did the shift happens book, by the way, Kickstarter lets you create unique URLs
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.780]   for, you know, a bazillion of them to track.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.380]   And so we can see how Twitter performed when, when Marching or I used an account I barely
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:18.660]   post to I'm posted hardly since November, but I've been posting promotional things when
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.700]   those come up projects I'm working on.
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:24.540]   We can see how it performed relative to Mastodon and other social media.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.060]   And it performed quite well.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.740]   Oh, so you keep right delivering.
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.740]   Okay.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.260]   Don't shoot yourself in the foot, but don't be.
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.940]   I'm not trying to make Twitter a better place.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.940]   No.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.940]   No.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.940]   But I'll use it.
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.940]   I just wanted to available tools and make some more.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:41.140]   The company still on our Twitter social.
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140]   Yeah, we still do it.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:45.860]   Yeah, our social media people do it.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:53.020]   Well, if I had the power, I would say don't, but I don't have the power to do that.
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.820]   I haven't posted on Twitter in ages since since November.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.700]   So today I went to the I want to Fannie for them, which was a today and tomorrow is a
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:08.820]   is an unconference online for folks on the Fediverse.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.660]   Good folks there talking about important stuff.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.340]   But let's note one thing.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.820]   There wasn't a black person among the 65 people who were there.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:22.980]   And so there are communities that's only one of them that's are still on Twitter and
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:24.820]   it's not it's easy for me to move off Twitter.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.940]   It's not easy for community move off Twitter.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.100]   And we got to recognize that people have invested in it.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:36.340]   They have value there and to leave and say, Oh, there's okay.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.740]   Almost looks like white flight to the suburbs.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:42.260]   Yeah, a little bit careful here.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:47.140]   You know, it's someone brought that up as well, Forrest, the communities and they asked
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:52.840]   me about it and I said, well, for me, when I go to the Fediverse side of things, it looks
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:58.320]   it definitely looks like people are trying to build community and I get that.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.480]   But I'm a broadcaster.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:07.440]   My community is very, very small and most of my community even know my phone number.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.680]   You ever heard of phone numbers?
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.680]   Most of my community.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.680]   White pages are red.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.480]   The white pages are here.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.720]   So that's where I am with this stuff.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.520]   And I get that, you know, Twitter can still be used to connect a lot of people.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.960]   Unfortunately, it's just a lot of a cesspool crap happening, but trying to get say black
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:32.120]   Twitter more so not black Twitter black folks to jump to the Fediverse.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:36.720]   I find it an interesting challenge, especially when most people are like, well, isn't that
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.840]   a Facebook clone or isn't that a Twitter clone?
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.240]   Why do I want to go over there?
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.880]   At least every time I ask somebody that's quote unquote normal and black about the Fed
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:52.880]  iverse activity pump.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.240]   There are some on the Fediverse.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:02.320]   I mean, you just searched that hashtag black massed on Twitter and all of that.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:10.480]   There's a ton in there, you know, but again, if I go and explain that to say a cousin of
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.160]   mine or they never heard of it.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.320]   It doesn't matter, it doesn't live here in California.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320]   You're right.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:20.120]   You're going to be like, why do you know?
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.320]   Well, another discussion was a lot of the affordances that people say black Twitter
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:27.920]   needs the discussion today was the journalist need.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.920]   They want search.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.720]   They want quote tweets.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.080]   Yeah, they want to be able to search for URLs that there's other things that, you know,
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.520]   Taylor Lorenz comes on a mast on and says, they're working for me, folks.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.080]   Boy, she didn't last long.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.080]   No, she didn't.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   She chased her right out.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.000]   Yeah, but she's also a broadcaster.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.160]   Yeah, she has different needs.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.200]   I just I wish people wouldn't support Elon, but that's just me.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   I know.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.200]   I know.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.800]   I don't like it either, but I think it's a mistake.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.000]   You know, same reason I'm not on truth social.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.640]   I just I don't want to support it.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.640]   It's going to keep going down.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:07.640]   I mean, his latest thing is that only people who pay will be will be promoted in the for
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.840]   you, which means that that's people I know and eight bucks bucks.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.440]   And so it makes it completely unusable.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   He's one button.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.840]   Do you think people you know will pay eight bucks?
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.240]   I think I see one or two who have, but I think less.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.080]   I think I think I think horribly on the now and I will probably unfollow every single
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.080]   one of them.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.080]   Seriously.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.080]   That kind of judgment.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.960]   Let me ask to be on Twitter.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.560]   It's another matter to give the shmuck money.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.960]   Let me ask about TikTok.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.440]   You think TikTok will end up being banned or do you think it will be?
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.880]   What do you think is going to happen?
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.480]   This is all going to go away.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.080]   They've made their made their noise.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.920]   I think as long as we have lobbyists, it probably will go away because they want to
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.680]   keep their likes of Facebook and Twitter happy here in the good old US.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:05.600]   They and figure out a way to to trick those folks into trick the leadership into banning
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.280]   it so they can continue to get more mind share.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.040]   I think that's more of a plan.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.480]   That's just my two cents.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.400]   I'll give you a reason to hate TikTok.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:22.240]   Norwegian company, NAMMO, which makes, I guess, ammo.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:29.280]   Interestingly, Norwegian ammo says they cannot make enough Ukrainian ammunition because there's
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.000]   a nearby TikTok data center using up all the electricity.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.800]   NAMMO says they can't expand ammunition manufacturing capacity to aid Ukraine until the TikTok
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.800]   data center.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.800]   She then shuts down.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.800]   Wow.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   She doesn't know.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   Wow.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.800]   It's monopol.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.160]   Well, I think you've got to talk to the local utility is monopolizing electricity in the
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   region.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.520]   Is there a lobbyists involved there?
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.640]   NAMMO is co-owned by the Norwegian government.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.000]   You think they'd have some cloud?
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.440]   Yeah, you think they have a cloud here.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.640]   But that's Norway, right?
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.200]   There's very egalitarian.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.680]   We are concerned because we see our future growth is challenged by the storage of cat
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.080]   videos.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.720]   This sounds like an onion piece, but it's like guardian.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.480]   It really doesn't.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.440]   The guardian one, because it just sounded too wacky.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.000]   I don't know this reporter.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.760]   It's kind of be, I mean, it's weird.
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.560]   Actually, of Norway, of course, they call it TikTok.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.560]   Just nothing.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560]   Sorry.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.560]   Go what?
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.560]   What do they call?
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   Tuck Tuck?
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560]   See yourself out.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.560]   Tuck Tuck.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.560]   No, we agents are tuck tuck.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.560]   Tuck tuck.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.560]   Oh, tuck tuck.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.560]   Never.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.560]   Tuck.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.560]   Tuck.
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:51.560]   Well, apparently the story originated in this Rupert Murdoch publication, The Financial Times.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.560]   Oh, that's not.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.560]   That's not here.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560]   He doesn't know the finish.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.200]   European ammunition maker says this is, this is, this is, yeah, it's a storage aggregated.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.760]   So who did the financial times get it from?
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.760]   Oh, let's see.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760]   Let's see.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.800]   What's the telephone game?
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:12.600]   Demand for ammunition has surged thanks to the war in Ukraine, which is using about
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.240]   6,000 rounds per day.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.400]   I don't think you're allowed to do accents from war is involved.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.400]   Okay.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.400]   Let's go to the most.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:27.120]   Ron Seck said demand for artillery rounds was more than 15 times higher than normal.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:32.240]   The European ammunition industry needs to invest two billion in new factories, just to keep
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.560]   up with the demand from Ukraine, let alone other European countries, according to the
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.320]   NAMO chief executive.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.200]   Tic Toc is building three data centers is, you know, if I have a choice between guns and
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.440]   cat video, I'm going to choose cat video.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.800]   Tic Toc is building three data centers this year with the option of adding two more by
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:58.560]   2025 in Hamar, which is 25 kilometers to the east of Raulfos.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.200]   Norwegian data center provider Green Mountain said this month, asked whether it was going
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:08.560]   to be a coincidence that a Chinese owned company, oh, here we go, was stopping a defense company's
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   expansion.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:16.520]   Brandseg replied, I will not rule that out that it's not by pure coincidence that this
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.000]   activity is close to a defense company.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.560]   I can't rule that out.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.560]   Tic Toc.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.560]   Okay.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.320]   So I just found a story on often posted.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320]   Often posted.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.320]   I created 327.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:39.640]   That's only one story in the major paper of Norrail put in the chat right now.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.240]   And you can use Google translate.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.240]   I'm satisfied that the financial times did not make this up.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.520]   No, but it's weird.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.120]   Well, I love it with Google can't translate the oddities of the language.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.720]   So Tic Toc takes the power from in it from the industry, says the headline.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.360]   From the top head, the project at Hamar is an egg from hell.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.960]   I'm sure that means something.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.960]   Not cock.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.960]   Toc is a dog.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.240]   That's very, that's very Norwegian and egg from hell.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.880]   Yes.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:18.240]   Next time I'm in Christian, son, I will, I will refer to it as an egg from hell.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.560]   It's in the text to the project is an egg from hell.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.960]   It could be a disaster for inland industries.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.720]   We can defense capabilities and damage Norway's reputation in NATO.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.400]   It's an opinion piece.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.400]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.360]   Now, now I'm going to find out egg from hell Norwegian.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.400]   Oh, so is the CEO of the company is one being quoted.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.400]   Not government officials.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:46.960]   So is it the CEO for a story of an Amazon region in order to yeah, Nemo ammo.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.360]   You have a choice cat videos or ammo.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:56.680]   Actually, you know what, because it didn't take, they're now saying and green steel.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:04.000]   So now what now, how much would you pay Gordon Moore, founder of Intel and the guy who was
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.880]   embarrassed that he was known as the creator of Moore's law passed away, passed away last
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.360]   week at the age of nine ripe old age of 94.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:22.400]   Gordon was one of the, what do they call them, the unfaithful eight, the evil eight, the
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.920]   left hazel, they left shot hateful later something.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.320]   Hey, something now that's a that's a movie.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.280]   That's a movie.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.400]   They left to start fair child electronics.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.800]   They left Shockley to start in 1956, I think somewhere long.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.960]   This is a long time ago in the earliest days of microprocessors.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.680]   They left Shockley to create fair child.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.040]   And then a few years later, the traitorous eight.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.640]   That's the name of it.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:57.320]   Gordon Moore, Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, later of Kleiner Perkins, Robert Neuss, also
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:03.840]   one of the co-founders of Intel Victor Greenwich, Julius Blank, John Herney and Jay last were
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.440]   the traitorous eight.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.440]   They left Shockley in 1957 to found fair child.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.480]   And of course, then later went on, three of them went on to found Intel.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:27.160]   So he was one of the founders of Intel and never called it, by the way, Moore's law.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:32.440]   It was the name Moore's law was coined, coined later by a tech journalist.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.720]   Moore's law also apparently was misrepresented.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.200]   But I've been saying for a long time that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.040]   would double every 18 months.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.680]   It turns out he said every two years.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.240]   But what that means is processors, performance would double every two years.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:43:00.000]   And he has been pretty much correct ever since the name Moore's law.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.280]   Do you think he's going to end or not?
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.280]   That's still the debate.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.200]   He doesn't get to see how it turns out.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:10.920]   The name Carver Mead popularizes the term Moore's law in 1975.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:15.440]   Moore often said he was embarrassed that was called Moore's law.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.800]   But nevertheless, it was fairly, I think, fairly accurate.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.320]   I don't know if it's over.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.400]   Is it over?
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.840]   It's too soon to say it's over.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.960]   Here's a graph from Wikipedia, Moore's law.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:39.760]   And over on the left-hand side, the Intel 4004, which had around 1200 transistors in 1971.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:49.440]   And on the right-hand side, more modern processors like the AMD Epic and Apple's M2 processor,
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.000]   we're getting up to 50 billion transistors on a single die.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.480]   So as you can see, because this is a logarithmic scale, as you can see, it really has doubled
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.960]   every two years.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.000]   It's actually been almost an amazing prediction.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.260]   It's been so accurate.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:13.520]   I put in the rundown the original Intel business plan.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.520]   Oh, yeah?
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.840]   Which is one badly-type page.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:19.760]   It's amazing.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.280]   Was the third-step profit?
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:24.760]   Nailed it.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   I think so.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.800]   I think so.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.680]   Oh, how about this, the Utah governor.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:39.360]   He signs a law requiring parents have to consent for minors to use social media.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.280]   And by the way, minors is anybody under 18.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:44.560]   You got a 17-year-old.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.280]   You got to get mom and dad to allow you to use social media.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.280]   And by the way, no matter who, you can't use it after 1030 and you can't use it before
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.640]   630 based on location.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.160]   You're going to be marching into homes, letting you have your guns, but making sure your
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.160]   kids not online.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.800]   You're going to be working in a coal mine.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   Well said.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.800]   You have to jar this.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   Well said.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.800]   You'll be making sneakers.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.200]   But don't be on that Twitter.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.240]   Glenn's volume just went that way down.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.840]   No, he's fine.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.840]   Oh.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.640]   Oh, he muted himself.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.640]   Good.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.480]   Now you chased him away.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.880]   No, I ran off.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880]   Wow.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.880]   Good lord.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.880]   I want you to do that to Stacy.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.600]   Please say we're having some technical my sister.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   I think you were fine.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   No, he was talking.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   We couldn't know.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   We couldn't hear before.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.800]   No, my placement.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.040]   My mic is doing weird things.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.200]   So did you hear me now?
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.200]   That's great.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.200]   We hear you now.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.160]   You can just edit me out of the show entirely.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160]   No, I don't miss.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.640]   Nope, not happening.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.920]   By the way, this like a band of TikTok would be almost impossible to enforce.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.520]   I don't know what the plan is.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:53.200]   It's well, plus it means that every person in Utah, one, you got to find out the other
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.200]   in Utah.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.240]   Number two, everybody has to prove their age.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.680]   If you're if you're my small government, I still have to go somewhere and say, see, I'm
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.800]   not 18.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.120]   The party of small government just want someone in your house monitoring your age at all
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.120]   times.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   That's all we need.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120]   That's all we need.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.120]   No sex like that.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.160]   However, be Utah.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.920]   Maybe you can have a few lives, but not the doing certain things.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.240]   The party of small government and big binoculars.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.320]   Oh, it's so awful.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.320]   It's just so awful.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:28.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.320]   I'm going to say it.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.320]   I'm going to say it.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.000]   Stacy's not here to get mad at me, but this is the these are the fruits of moral panic.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.040]   When you enable such panic about this, it allows crap like this to get passed and it
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.840]   affects us all.
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.840]   Thank you, Ant.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:54.720]   The computer history museum is the original poorly typed Intel business plan.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.760]   The company will engage in research development.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:04.280]   Oh, ADN manufacturer and sales of they got typos in here integrate electric.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.960]   Should we feed this to chat GPT and see if there's any future that type writer.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:10.960]   See, you're ribbon.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.960]   Look at the ribbon.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:12.960]   That's what I was going to ask.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.280]   I think they typed it in March in website.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.200]   This looks exactly like this.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.200]   Lanky scale and integration.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.760]   Look how it's higher too.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.320]   They tried to express something that didn't work.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.320]   Why is it?
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.320]   It's quite what is that?
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.320]   Principal customers.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.360]   I guess that's what that's supposed to be.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.080]   Many of these customers will be located outside California.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   Wow.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.080]   Wow.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.240]   This is I don't know.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240]   That's I don't know who they came from.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.520]   It comes from the computer history museum.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.840]   So that's why I believe.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.960]   I guess they were going out trying to get investments.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.680]   How old was more?
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.880]   94, which honestly, if you and I get there, we have no research.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:55.880]   What's in my father?
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:56.880]   97.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.320]   Yeah, it's just God bless.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]   It's hard.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.320]   He's 97.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.320]   Wow.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.320]   97.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320]   And he's just gone through with COVID.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.560]   He went through two hospitalizations internal bleeding pneumonia and hallucinations had brought
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.720]   God bless me back home and doing well.
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.720]   Good.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:12.720]   That's outstanding.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720]   Geez.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:16.720]   You want to move on?
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:23.320]   1988 at the National Science Foundation, the new assistant director and a colleague
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.920]   swapped ideas about the future of a dial up network barely known at the time to the public.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:29.920]   1988.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.240]   I kind of might have known about it, but anyway, restricted mostly to academia and federal
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:35.240]   agencies.
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:36.240]   Show me the video.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.240]   Well, when was the well?
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.040]   Actually, you quite have video.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.040]   Yeah, might.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:46.360]   Well, because that my first experience on the well and that was.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.000]   I was just in the 1980s.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.800]   Was around then.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800]   85.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800]   85.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.800]   Okay.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800]   Help me get a job.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.440]   So the well, which was a it's still around.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:01.880]   Yes, it's 1985 is was a early, you know, kind of chat board.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.360]   A lot of people in the Bay Area, especially were on it.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.040]   Stuart brand started it.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.880]   He went off a houseboat, his houseboat for a while, but I remember when I was on the
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.320]   well that you could issue a command and drop out of the forum into this weird thing
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:23.480]   where there were things like gopher and Archie and you could go around and see stuff.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.280]   And I'll never forget experiencing that.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.360]   And then like, there's a lot of people on here.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:34.800]   So I think by 1988, I'd had some experience with this internet.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.040]   It wasn't what it was going to be.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.320]   But I think by then I probably had any event.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:48.160]   A doctor, William Wolf, this assistant director at the NSF said it hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.320]   Imagine the colleague said if this system was open to everyone within weeks, Dr. Wolf
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:01.640]   was in contact with the inventor of the internet, Al Gore, a Democratic Senator for Tennessee.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.120]   He'd been talking up for years before this, the promise of a data superhighway.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:11.080]   You may not remember, but Al Gore's father was responsible for the interstate highway
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.680]   system many in the 50s.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:22.680]   So his son, like I like how he said, you may not remember to add wasn't born for like
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.000]   a half a century later.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.720]   You may remember, Dr. what was Al Gore's father?
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.720]   He was Al Gore Jr.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:32.800]   I think his father was Al Gore as well.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:38.360]   Anyway, Dr. Wolf asked if Gore would spearhead efforts to drop the government gatekeepers
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.880]   from the digital domain.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:47.160]   This now, I know you remember this because the NSF ran the internet for the longest time
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:51.640]   and the NSF had rules, NSF had rules about commercial speech.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.040]   You couldn't advertise on the internet.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:51:04.040]   The day the NSF gave the internet to the people was the day commercialism came to the internet.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.680]   What was that?
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.680]   I wrote an article about that called The Experiment Is Over, right when that happened in 1994,
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680]   maybe?
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.680]   Is that possible?
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:16.680]   Let's see, 1998.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.680]   What?
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.240]   Oh, no, no, no, it was when the browser came out.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.240]   So it was 1995.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.240]   1995.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:26.680]   Okay, so this is from an article.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:28.400]   I've got an article here from the NSF.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.280]   They should know.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.480]   The NSF went online in 1986, connected the supercomputer centers of 56,000 bits per
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.320]   second, 56k baud.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:43.320]   And that was how I was getting onto it, by the way.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.400]   If I was lucky, a 56k.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.400]   300 baud.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   Usbodx modem.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.720]   Yeah, I had the acoustic modem before that.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.160]   In a short time, the network became congested.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:58.200]   By 1988, its links were upgraded to 1.45 megabits per second, which was what?
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.200]   The speed of a T1.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.200]   That's right.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.040]   A variety of regional research and education networks supported in part by the National
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:11.000]   Science Foundation and ARPANET were connected to the NSF net backbone, thus extending the
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.800]   internet's reach throughout the United States.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.080]   But its existence, NSF net carried at no cost.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:22.920]   Any US research and education traffic that could reach it.
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.200]   If you can figure out how to get on this.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.880]   Yeah, it won't cost you.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.120]   This was April 21, 1995, was the start of the transition.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.640]   They agreed to support it for four years.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:39.480]   But that's when the major commercial backbones, I have a list here, SprintLink, MCI, PSI, UU
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.280]   Net, network 99.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.600]   Do any of these names sound familiar besides maybe SprintLink?
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.600]   I remember UU.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.600]   Were the ones...
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.800]   So these were all the backbones, the internet backbones.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.280]   Because at that time it was run by the NSF.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.280]   These were the contractors.
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:59.120]   The year 1998, according to the NSF, marks the end of NSF's direct role in the internet.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:04.120]   That year the network access points in routing arbiter functions are transferred to the commercial
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:05.120]   sector.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.120]   I'm not sure when...
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.120]   That's not exactly right.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.120]   They're actually...
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.040]   Their own history is inaccurate because that process, I wrote this contemporaneously and
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:15.800]   I know this because I started internet company in 1990.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:18.120]   Gosh, what was it?
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120]   1984?
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.120]   I think I need five.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.120]   No, I don't remember.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:26.280]   And it was an early web hosting company and we were able to do what we did because we could
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:29.400]   get a commercial link to the internet and run it legally.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   I mean, it was a...
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.000]   I don't think you're wrong or they're wrong.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000]   It was a process.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.400]   So it was a multi-year process, but they started it at a point...
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:42.000]   In '93, it's the proliferation of private suppliers led to an NSF solicitant.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.920]   In '93, that outlined a new internet architecture that largely remains in place today.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.040]   So the transition began in '93, which would make sense for me.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.640]   I'm trying to remember when I was a dumb, this fucking fascinating that you started...
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.320]   It's pretty cool that he did that, isn't it?
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.880]   I didn't know when you were a pioneer.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.880]   Internet company in 1994.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:03.560]   I had one of the earliest...
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:07.000]   It was in 1990, and I'm trying to remember the year, of course, since I'm so old, I've
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.360]   forgotten a company called Point of Presence Company.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.560]   I started in spring of 1993, and it was one of the very first web hosting companies.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.400]   I saw a tiny screenshot of the NCSA browser that Mark Andreessen was one of the people
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:28.240]   who developed at NCSA at the University of Illinois, or Bay-Trapana, Urbana-Sripana.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:33.320]   Well, when you speak Champaign-Urbana, another call to Urbana-Champaign, I don't know why.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.440]   But it was in Mac Week magazine.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.120]   There's a tiny little picture of what the browser looked like.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:40.800]   I remember I bossed the time and said, "That could be the future."
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.800]   I was like, "You're right."
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:46.680]   I started a company a few months later, but we were able to get T1 service that fall that
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.760]   was commercial and hosted Peachbut Press in a few...
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:53.720]   Flash April 1st of 1996.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.520]   Glenn Fleischman, CEO of Point of Tidbits Hostsite Presence Company, announced today that the
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.120]   company plans to expand its business to additional dimensions.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.400]   Fleischman said that in 1996, the company's name will change to line of Presence Company
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.400]   Direct.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.400]   This is our...
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.400]   Like this focus on the second dimension.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400]   Oh, this is April 4st.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.400]   April 1st, 1996.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.400]   That's right.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.400]   You saw it's Tidbits.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.400]   We hosted Tidbits on some old Sun Microsystems.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.400]   That's very...
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.400]   It was great.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.400]   I wouldn't be where I am today if the NSF net had it started the transition when it did.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.600]   It was exactly at the time when we wanted to put commercial internet on.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.320]   I have often had the bragging rights.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.320]   We actually made money.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:34.280]   We didn't make a lot of money, like literally tens of thousands of dollars over the years.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:38.160]   We were profitable when I sold the company and it remained profitable until it was shut
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:44.440]   down when the person who sold it joined what became part of all recipes.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.760]   Other people lost millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.160]   I'm like, "Well, I made hundreds of millions of dollars more than they did it by $1,000
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.160]   or whatever."
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.160]   Popco.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   What a great name.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.160]   Popco.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.800]   Do you even keep the domain probably, huh?
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:57.800]   No, it's...
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:00.400]   And it's other people's hands now, but many years ago, many years ago.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.480]   That's a great domain name.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:03.040]   So the Popcorn Company domain.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:04.040]   That's right.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:07.200]   You would have made more for the company than from the company.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.400]   By the way, that's still Glenn's phone number, I just want to say.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.880]   Sadly, no.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:16.800]   So in 1994, you start that company.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:23.200]   I didn't know anything about the internet until about September of 1995.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.840]   That was the very first time my eyes saw the magical world of the internet.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:33.000]   And then when I think about my kids and how they were just sort of born into it, and
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.480]   it was just like second nature, it's so fascinating.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:40.160]   You started a dad company.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.480]   You were already deep in the trenches.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.080]   And a year later, I'm just not figuring out like, "What the heck is this on this computer?"
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.520]   We have pictures on a computer that's from all over the world.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:52.720]   How is this even possible?
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:56.480]   And I just remember my mind being blown back in '95.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480]   We started that...
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:01.000]   You were the first time you had like a megabit per second connection, and you're like, "Oh,
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.160]   I remember getting to the one axis.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.200]   I think I got T1 axis somewhere around 2000, something like that."
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.680]   And that blew my mind.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.680]   I think I didn't...
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.200]   That was about when I got ISDN, which is 128 kilobits.
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:17.200]   Right, and it is.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.440]   I didn't get anywhere faster than that for a long, long time.
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:22.040]   It wasn't until I got to cable internet.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:29.160]   The early days of before Comcast was at home, and I had an ad-hand connection.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:31.520]   So I was at Delphi in the summer.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.520]   Delphi.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.520]   Gene Delphi and Copyser.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.360]   Well, they're all right.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360]   So I went to Delphi.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.360]   86?
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:39.360]   Holy cow.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]   At 96.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:41.360]   96.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:42.360]   Okay.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.360]   Or 94.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.360]   Sorry, when did the browser come out?
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:45.360]   93 or 94?
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.360]   94.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.360]   It was the commercial browser.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.360]   It was the commercial browser.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.840]   Oh, the major 94.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.440]   They were in the process of having to create a GUI.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:55.840]   The Berdock had bought it.
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:01.040]   They didn't have a GUI because it was just a green screen monochrome monotype, right?
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:04.040]   And much panic about we got to have a GUI, we got to have a GUI, we got to be AOL,
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:05.040]   we got to be AOL.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.480]   And I was in the office when they came in and said, "This thing, the browser is just
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.840]   getting released to the public."
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:14.520]   And all the geeks said, "Oh hell."
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.120]   And the news core, Hollywood people said, "Oh, that's too ugly.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.120]   Don't ever use that.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.840]   What are you going to get away from us?"
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.840]   It's keep making it away.
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.240]   Honestly, they weren't far wrong.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:24.240]   It was really ugly.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240]   October 1994.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:28.240]   And I'll tell you, this is how early we were as a company.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.720]   My business partner was quoted to the press release for Netscape Navigator 1.0 because
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.520]   there weren't any other web hosting companies out there.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.920]   So they called us like, "Hey, you want to be in the press release?"
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:39.520]   And Todd said, "Sure."
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.520]   And it cracks me up.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:44.240]   I mean, it all changed very quickly after that, obviously.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:45.840]   But, and we didn't ride that wave.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:52.000]   And I joined Amazon in late '96 and sold my company and went on that bandwagon and left
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000]   very quickly.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.160]   But it was weird times you could like, you know, email Jerry Yang at Yahoo or something.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.200]   And he'd be like, "Hey, what's going on?"
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.040]   You want to really feel old?
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.480]   There's now a plaque at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:07.480]   Mosaic.
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:13.600]   The first popular graphical browser for the World Wide Web was created by Mark L. Andreson
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:18.920]   and Eric Jay Zemena at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:24.480]   Upon its 1993 release to the public, Mosaic gave internet users easy access to multimedia
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.320]   sources of information.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:32.000]   Web browsers have transformed the exchange of information.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.800]   And now you know.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.560]   The sign will be updated in the future back when we use primitive high-based technology
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.320]   before our neural implants.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.320]   That's pretty primitive.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.320]   Pretty deep.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.880]   But you see that this is out of the rundown.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:47.920]   Musk is now trying to do a part because his effort to do the implants got turned down.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:51.000]   Because my little wires are doing horrible things.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.720]   So now he's trying to do a partnership with the company.
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:58.840]   The last person on earth I would trust to put anything in my brain is Elon Musk.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:02.480]   And anybody who lets him do that is the extreme of the eight buckschmuck.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:05.720]   I don't want to trust you with anything if you have that kind of judgment.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:06.720]   So back to Dr. Paul.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.280]   The landing goes back thousands of years.
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:12.280]   That's right.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.280]   That's right.
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:17.080]   They used to do it during the Napoleonic Wars on the sailing ships.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:18.080]   They would cut a little...
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.080]   They're Neanderthals.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:22.080]   They're Neanderthal skulls.
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:23.080]   So they were tripanning in...
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:24.080]   Wow.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.080]   Wow.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:26.080]   That's wild.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.120]   Either that or somebody hit them with a round axe and it just happened out.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.880]   So William Wolf passed away at the age of 83, widely considered one of the creators
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:36.880]   of the internet.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:41.560]   He's the guy who called Al Gore, got Gore to push changes through Congress.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.240]   He did not invent the internet, but he certainly facilitated it.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.040]   Let's do recognize that Al Gore deserves credit for helping it happen.
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.040]   Yeah.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:50.040]   Yeah.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:51.040]   He's part of the reason.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.040]   Yes.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.960]   Passed away in Charlottesville at the age of 83 on a March 10th.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:04.520]   He said, "I don't know where I was headed when he helped create what we now know as the
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:05.520]   modern internet."
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.240]   It's a good old bit.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:09.240]   Very nice, so good.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.480]   I'm not watching it post.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:24.920]   Um, follow up on, uh, remember Serial and Adnan Saeed, who was the subject of the probably
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:29.520]   the most popular, first certainly podcast to have more than a million listeners.
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.720]   Serial.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:38.880]   And of course it was the podcast that brought attention to this case and eventually got
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.160]   the release last year of Adnan Saeed.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.000]   His, um, his conviction has been reinstated.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.260]   Pellet and Marilyn ruled that a lower court had violated the right of the victim's brother
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:55.320]   to have been notified and to attend a hearing.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:00.600]   So, uh, it's not like, it's not like they're going to start all over or, but they do need
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:03.000]   to, they do need to redo that hearing.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000]   Redo the hearing.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000]   Yeah.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000]   Just what a shame.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000]   I mean, what a shame.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.160]   This is, I think what the, if you read with the lawyers for Adnan said was, you know,
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:14.120]   this doesn't help.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.640]   Um, what's her name?
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:17.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:18.640]   I'm blanking at it.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:23.000]   The victim doesn't help the victim's family to have him go back to jail or this hearing
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.760]   again because at least it's no one's any closer to actually identifying the person who
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:27.760]   killed him.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.560]   It's a kilter because it's obviously, I mean, I followed this case.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.920]   So you, you believe it's serial.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:37.480]   It's serial imply that he was innocent or just raised the question.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.200]   I didn't raise the question.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:45.720]   There's one of his close family friends, uh, Robbie Achoudry, who was the lawyer first
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:48.800]   brought the case to the attention of Sarah Koenig.
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:54.440]   She had her own podcast with John Cryer as a co-host just by the way of all things undisclosed
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.960]   and they covered the case in depth.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.800]   She wrote a book.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.920]   There's a lot of information that wasn't presented and the fellow, his so-called friend, had four
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:05.680]   or five totally different accounts of what happened.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.960]   But the end, the real issue is he was placed elsewhere.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.480]   There was information from cell towers.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.000]   Wasn't disclosed to the defense.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000]   His attorney was dying.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.640]   Uh, uh, Adnan's attorney was dying at the time.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:21.520]   She actually literally was dying and hadn't disclosed that and mounted improper defense
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.800]   left things out.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.160]   The prosecution didn't present all the information that should have been available.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.520]   That's why it was vacated.
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:30.280]   It's very clear he wasn't in the place that he was said to.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.960]   It's very unlikely that he had anything to do with it.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.440]   And there's probably somebody else out there, and there's somebody else out there committed
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:40.000]   the crime and it's, it's just the, there's nothing that points to him being in the right
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000]   place at the right time.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.960]   And there are people who saw him elsewhere and the cell records show that he wasn't there.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.440]   So it's just a, so somebody, somebody got away with this.
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:54.200]   So honestly, it's merely a technicality that the, uh, her brother had not been given enough
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.200]   time.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:59.560]   Uh, one day, in fact, uh, notice that they were going to have this hearing.
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:01.520]   Uh, he wanted more time.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.000]   He wanted an opportunity to speak to his attorney to understand what the evidence was.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.320]   Um, and so at the last minute he got on a zoom call.
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.200]   Uh, the question was whether that was sufficient notice.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.360]   Uh, and the court, uh, this week decided it was not a two to one decision.
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.640]   They reversed the earlier decision of vacate temporarily reinstating a side's conviction.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.240]   The court stayed the new decision for 60 days, meaning it doesn't affect, take effect for
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:32.200]   two months to give the prosecution and defense, uh, time to adjust to the reinstated verdict.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.520]   He's not going back to prison.
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:39.480]   Uh, and I suspect the, uh, ultimate outcome will be the same, which is he'll be, his conviction
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.480]   will be vacated.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.000]   It just, just highlights.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.160]   I mean, the prosecutors joined in having this, uh, decision, or this, this case vacated
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.080]   because they found essentially a sculptory evidence that was available at the time and
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.080]   wasn't presented.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.080]   It's a very clear thing.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:54.360]   They'll be another hearing.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.760]   The same information will be presented.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:58.720]   It wasn't fully disclosed because I think it's being investigated actually.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:02.440]   And maybe it's a, but it was Heyman Lee, I shouldn't, you know, never forget the victims
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.440]   name.
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:07.240]   Um, and, uh, you know, hopefully they will eventually bring somebody to justice for this
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:09.840]   because it's essentially an unsolved crime.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.840]   Yeah.
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:13.280]   Uh, let's see.
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:18.920]   Did we talk about the Pope in the puffer code?
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:20.720]   No, we haven't.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:21.720]   No.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:27.280]   I am ashamed to admit, and I, you know, I mean, honestly, I, one of the, my regular duties
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:32.600]   every morning is to scan the news and find stories for, uh, you know, upcoming shows.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:38.120]   And I saw the picture of the pope in a puffer coat and didn't think twice about it, but
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.280]   I didn't think it was fake.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.680]   Um, well, I, like I said, I didn't think twice about it.
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.120]   Um, I guess had I thought about it.
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.160]   It was too, it was too good to be true.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.160]   It was just too good.
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:58.680]   I would have thought, well, it seems unlikely that the pope would be wearing this jacket,
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:05.400]   this Balenciaga, especially since it's clearly a tailored to be a papal papal regalia.
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:08.080]   You know, it's got the, the belt and everything.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:11.960]   Uh, anyway, tiny, tiny hand with the tiny, tiny cup.
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:16.360]   It looks like he's got his own, uh, papal water bottle.
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:19.360]   Anyway, um, obviously it's fake.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:23.040]   If you think about it, but I was thinking, I just thought, Oh, that's cool.
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:24.560]   The pope's got a nice, warm jacket.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:25.560]   That's all I thought.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:32.040]   Uh, apparently a lot of other people, uh, other people believed it, uh, for not very
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.280]   long, not very long.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.560]   The truth was, yeah, the truth came out.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:41.340]   All, all the, it already had moral panic about the, about the puffer coat is it took no
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:43.720]   time for the truth to become out.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.280]   And we all knew that it wasn't.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.440]   And, and people were having to fit about this.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.840]   Oh my God, there's changes all of our sense of truth.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.540]   No, it doesn't.
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:56.980]   Ryan Broderick tweeted, I think the Balanciaga pope might be the first real mass level AI
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.420]   misinformation case.
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:06:59.420]   Come on.
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.420]   Really?
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:01.420]   Really?
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:02.420]   No.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, uh, the guy who made it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.560]   Do I have that in here?
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.640]   Oh, who made it?
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:12.400]   He was, he was, he was the guy who made, who made the picture.
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.240]   I was on mushrooms, man.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:24.440]   Oh, geez, oh, we need to get that sound by Ryan Broderick says that because he was taken
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:25.440]   in by it.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.440]   He was scammed.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:29.000]   So he feels exactly got sucked in.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.240]   Well, it's, it's, it's Chrissy Teigen was also taken in.
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:36.520]   I thought the pope's puffer jacket was real and didn't give it a second thought.
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:39.420]   No way I am surviving the future of technology.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.640]   That's a pretty good one.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.560]   He's something salient to, to add to the.
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.920]   And a glance it did look real at a glance.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:48.920]   It's fine.
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:49.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:50.920]   I didn't think.
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:52.040]   I didn't think is, I didn't retweet it.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:53.200]   I didn't share it.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.600]   I didn't do anything with it.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:56.680]   I just saw it passing and didn't think twice.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.680]   Yeah.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:58.680]   Wow.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.680]   That's cool.
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:01.480]   But you know, in hindsight, if you think about it, it was too good of a truth.
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.720]   But here's, here's the interesting thing about this.
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:09.160]   Imagine if you do that, you have it make that and then you can go to a manufacturer and
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.360]   say, I like this, make this for me.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:14.360]   Well, you can imagine.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:17.080]   It could start with fashion trends.
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:18.080]   Making fashions exactly.
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.080]   Yeah.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:20.080]   That's what's good.
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:21.080]   That is what's happening.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.800]   If they're using generative AI for places like she and to make new fashion, that has
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.800]   an impact.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.520]   Do you realize you use the key word for mid journey, Mr. Jarvis?
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:32.840]   What do you say?
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:36.240]   Do you realize you use the key word for mid journeys AI?
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.240]   Imagine.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.240]   That's how you start to.
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:39.240]   Imagine.
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:40.560]   That's all you have to do.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:47.480]   Here is a, here's an intrepid Amazon delivery.
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:54.800]   It's a police standoff, but there's your Amazon delivery guy going right in to make sure.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:09:02.600]   The package does not paid enough.
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:10.520]   Neither rain nor snow nor sleet nor dark of night nor police activity will halt this Amazon
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:11.520]   the ring.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.520]   Are the cops yelling at him or something?
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:15.120]   No, he's just going up the driveway.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.120]   There they go.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.120]   They say, wait, what?
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.120]   Oh, they took the package.
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.120]   Yeah, they took it.
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.120]   Oh my God.
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:21.120]   He said, okay, we got it.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.120]   Oh, that's a lot.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.120]   It's legit.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:24.120]   The guy's ammo in here.
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:25.120]   Yes.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.600]   All that driver knows is his job is done.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.600]   Yeah.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:30.600]   You can report to his super.
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:35.000]   He took a quick picture of the package so that the guy knows it was delivered.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.080]   He's like, I did my part.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.920]   That's incredible.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.360]   I did my part.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.760]   It's so calmly just walking in and walking back.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:48.320]   I respect that that man had a job to do and he got it done.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.320]   He did it.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.320]   Scott bless him.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.320]   God bless him.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.560]   He's kind of wondering now.
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.560]   Hey, where are the cops?
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.920]   There's a lot of cars like a cop.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:59.960]   He's like, man, I got the rear-headed more packages to get it right.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:02.440]   I think I'm walking a lot so far from this truck.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:10.240]   One down, two and 99 to go.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.480]   More than half a dozen Raleigh, North Carolina, police cars are visible at the scene.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:17.840]   The circumstances surrounding the stand-off are unclear, but the video has amassed more
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.640]   than seven million views.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:24.120]   Thanks for the humanity by going to that story.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:27.240]   That's how you get viral.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.480]   Let's say you go viral.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:33.920]   All right.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:40.200]   Have we done our duties covering the stories as we must?
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:42.400]   Have we done everything?
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:43.400]   The change log has--
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:44.400]   There's no change log.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:45.400]   Nothing.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:46.400]   Nothing.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:47.400]   No.
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:51.000]   So little that I don't even want to bring the band in and get the drums and everything
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]   because they're on a small--
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.560]   Because you don't want to pay them the money for it.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:55.880]   Yeah, you've got to pay them every time.
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:57.280]   Well, I have to pay them.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:59.520]   There's a union fee for cancellation.
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.520]   Of course.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:01.520]   Yeah.
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:04.080]   Because, of course, we use a union band.
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.040]   We don't stint.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:10.440]   I mean, but really, do you need to know that Google's going to start showing excessive
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:11.840]   heat warnings and search?
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:13.520]   I don't think you need to know that.
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:14.520]   No.
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.760]   We don't need to know, but it is a change.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:16.920]   It's nice to know.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:19.200]   I did put something in here for JeverB.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.200]   I see that.
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.200]   It's very far.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.200]   It's very far.
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:25.600]   But you put-- you know, OK, I've got to tell you something.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:26.600]   What?
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:29.000]   Jeff's not going to like this because it comes from the new--
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000]   Oh, I know.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]   That's exactly why I put it in here.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000]   You tried to--
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000]   Let me tell you something, man.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.320]   So you're trying to send me to the hospital.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.640]   I'm going to tell you something right now.
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:41.400]   Most of the show, I've been an 8-year-old for a relation.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:42.400]   What?
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.400]   I have been using my cardiad.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.400]   Oh, no.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.400]   Constantly.
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:46.400]   Get the hell out of here.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.960]   I think-- no, I think I'm knocking wood.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.960]   I think I'm--
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:50.960]   All right.
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:53.800]   Jeff, if you kill over during a show, I'm not going to forgive you.
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.040]   Well, we've discussed that.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.040]   Oh, what happened if I did?
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.280]   We have discussed that in the past.
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:00.440]   So, and you don't want to get Jeff upset tonight.
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.440]   Oh, man.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:02.440]   You don't want to do that.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.600]   So it's more about that snippet tax.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:08.400]   We all know it's a terrible idea.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.080]   Let me change the subject real quickly.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.040]   Since we're talking Rupert Murdoch, you know, he's getting married.
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:15.040]   Yeah, and to someone from Petaluma.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.040]   And she's a local.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:17.040]   Oh, no.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.280]   She went to Petaluma High.
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:20.280]   She's from Petaluma.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.280]   Graduated in 1975 from Petaluma High.
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.280]   1975.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.240]   She's that old.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.240]   I love this.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:28.240]   So Rupert Murdoch's--
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.560]   '92, '93, right?
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.560]   She's, I think, her sevenness.
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:34.800]   I thought she was a sister of mine.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.800]   Oh, yo, she's my age.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:36.800]   She is.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:37.800]   She's '60s.
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:38.800]   She's in her '60s, right?
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.480]   A good-looking woman.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:41.480]   I love this, though.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.240]   The optimism Rupert Murdoch showed by saying, I'm looking forward to spending the second
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:49.280]   half of our lives together.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:53.280]   Bad news for her.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.280]   He's supposed to go 184.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.280]   He's supposed to go 184.
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:57.280]   What the hell?
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.280]   The judge said about this, right?
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:05.240]   That was Rupert Murdoch supposed to be testifying in the case of one of the Dominion lawsuits
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:07.160]   where he's supposed to do its deposition.
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:12.160]   And the judge, Judge Eric Davis, said he received a letter previously that said Murdoch
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.920]   couldn't travel to the trial in Delaware.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.920]   And he's like, hey, so what's all this about him getting married and traveling between
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:19.560]   three houses and having no problems?
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:22.280]   And Fox's lawyers are like, oh, we never said he couldn't.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.320]   He was too feeble to travel.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:27.320]   We just meant to get married.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.800]   It's a honeymoon.
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:31.720]   Many different judges were very dubious.
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.280]   There was many different ways to say dubious about the Fox lawyers.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:37.280]   Yeah.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:38.280]   Wow.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:39.280]   '66.
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.040]   She, by the way, is wealthy because her previous husband died at three years after she married
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.800]   him and he left her a winery of vineyards.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.800]   Clear.
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:49.800]   Clear.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:50.800]   Coincidence.
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:51.800]   It was nothing.
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:53.240]   I'm not applying anything.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:54.580]   Nothing at all.
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:55.580]   Thank you.
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:56.580]   Thank you.
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:57.580]   He's my attorney.
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:00.680]   You know, there's the, there's the pedal.
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.680]   The article.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:02.680]   Here we go.
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:10.440]   Rupert Murdoch's newest wife, fifth times the charm and Leslie Smith of Petaluma.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.160]   And by the way, courtesy of Ann Leslie Smith, her high school photo.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.880]   Oh, oh, 1975.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:20.880]   She's my age.
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:28.960]   And, and Fox is 92, but they're going to spend the second half of their life together.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:35.920]   Her first, her first husband was the son of the Huntington railroad family, John P.
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:36.920]   Huntington.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:42.760]   Then she married country singer Chester Smith, 27 years her senior who passed away three
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:43.760]   years later.
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:49.560]   That's just, you're saying Rupert, you got no shot?
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.560]   She likes an older man.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.080]   I'm saying, what's the point is like silver Fox gray Fox is like a platinum Fox, a rhodium
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:59.480]   Fox, a uranium Fox.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:04.760]   You have to go up the metals.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:08.640]   There's a Californian Fox.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:11.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, Jeopardy champion, Glenn Fleischman, everybody.
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:12.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:13.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:16.120]   There's certain things you have to know if you're going to do Jeopardy, you got to know
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.080]   River, you got to know lakes and you got another periodic table in the area.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:27.880]   The table, the Rutherford, Rutherfordium Fox.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.680]   Before we get to our picks of the week and wrap this thing up and before I get to leave
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:37.560]   for the next three weeks, let me, let me, let me flog the club club to it.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:40.520]   Now some people are going to say, I can hear you now.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:45.280]   You know, I don't want to pay seven bucks a month to finance your fancy Dan vacations.
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:52.800]   Well, I will assure you that this vacation was paid for in 2019 one ago.
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.600]   Not one penny came from club Twitter.
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:01.480]   It didn't even, it wasn't even a twinkle in Lisa LePort's eye and every penny that
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:04.280]   we get from club to it goes into production.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:09.040]   It doesn't go into our pockets, but it is, I think a very important and very valuable
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:12.200]   thing because we want to keep doing what we do.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:13.200]   We love doing these shows.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.200]   We love adding new shows.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:20.680]   We have thanks to the club members added a bunch of new shows this week in space was
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.920]   a club exclusive that is now public.
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.920]   We brought back Scott Wilkinson's amazing home theater geeks thanks to the club.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.680]   Hands on windows with Micah Sergeant, hands on, I'm sorry, hands on windows with Paul
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:36.200]   Thorett, Micah does hands on Mac, of course.
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:38.600]   We have the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:44.160]   We have the Giz Fizz with Dick D. Bartolo, Stacy's book club, events that Ant Prudar
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:50.200]   community manager puts together, lots of great events and ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:51.720]   All that's just seven bucks a month.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.600]   We want to make it a real value for your dollar because we really appreciate it.
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:57.280]   I know seven bucks a month.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.720]   For some of you, that's just a couple of cups of coffee and I certainly don't want
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:02.640]   you to do it if you can't afford it.
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:05.520]   But if you like what we do and you want to support it, you want to keep it going and
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.000]   want to see new shows launched, this is the best way for you to do it.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.480]   Because you're given a seven bucks a month, you don't have to hear any ads.
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:15.800]   We don't have to monetize you any other way.
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.400]   If you want to be the customer, not the product, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:22.400]   We really appreciate it.
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.560]   I promise you not.
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:27.400]   One penny will go to my fancy Dan vacation.
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.400]   Not one penny.
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.320]   The one that they tried to cancel long year, gazillion times because you didn't cancel
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.320]   it.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:35.320]   Yeah.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.320]   Three times.
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.920]   I remember we were thinking, "God, we've got this cruise in four months.
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:44.040]   We've just shut the world down for COVID.
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:47.320]   Do you think we should cancel the cruise?"
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:49.040]   And we said, "Well, let's see.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.040]   Let's see.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:51.040]   Maybe COVID will be over in a few weeks."
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:53.040]   I think they're saying that, right?
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:55.080]   And fortunately, they canceled it for us.
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:57.400]   And then again, we may have booked it for a year later.
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.240]   It'll be over by 2021.
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.640]   Surely, it'll be over by 2020.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.200]   No.
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.200]   So I said...
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:05.200]   How long till you're my greatest?
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.640]   Well, I just said 2023.
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.040]   That's got to be safe, right?
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:09.280]   Well, we'll see.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:14.480]   If I come back sick as a dog.
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:16.800]   I'm actually kind of nervous, to be honest with you.
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.320]   What were you guys saying?
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:23.600]   Oh, my greatest achievement is we had a family trip planned for June or July of 2020.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.400]   And I booked it in January.
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:29.800]   We hit the button like right before COVID broke out right near us in Washington Steaks.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:32.920]   We were sort of ground zero just north of us.
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.560]   And I'll tell you, I got every penny back.
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:36.720]   I got the travel insurance refunded.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:39.080]   Oh, and that is an accomplishment.
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.480]   That's a huge accomplishment.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:43.480]   Yeah, I think we are out.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:45.880]   Where were you going to go, Glenn?
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:50.280]   Paris and London, we're aiming for that in July of this year, finally again.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:51.960]   I'm going to see if that goes.
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.480]   You two are hoping that 2023 is the right move.
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:01.120]   Well, I traveled last year and I got COVID maybe in Vienna in November, but I was very,
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.120]   very mild.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:03.520]   Didn't know to look up at that.
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.320]   Oh, this was a trip with your son?
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.320]   Oh, that trip you got to know that.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.320]   Oh, we didn't know you got COVID.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.920]   Got a very mild case, but I didn't test positive.
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:12.560]   Those of you get it?
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:17.520]   No, somehow he'd gotten to last May, a mild case and he didn't get it.
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:21.760]   And I also tested when I got home was positive, isolated from my family and they didn't get
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.760]   it.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.760]   Oh, that's good.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:24.760]   I was the only one.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.760]   I was a lucky chump, but it was OK.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.480]   Yeah, we got it on the last time we wanted a cruise last summer.
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:31.480]   In Seattle, right?
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:33.480]   You came up here and...
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.480]   Yeah, it was fairly mild.
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.480]   It was like a bad cold.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.920]   Lisa had longer term symptoms, unfortunately, but it was...
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.920]   What's she doing now?
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:40.920]   She's gone.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:41.920]   She's all better now.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:42.920]   Just in time for this trip.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.920]   Oh, good.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.920]   Good.
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:45.920]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:46.920]   But I think because we're...
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:49.080]   I mean, I've had five shots now as she...
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.080]   Plus...
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:53.720]   I just saw Leanna Wen, who I disagree with often these days.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:58.520]   She's in the Washington Post, but she's saying that us old folks should get another booster
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.520]   this spring.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520]   Well, give me my shot.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:05.160]   She says it, but the CDC and WHO don't, so I'm going to defer to them.
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:11.120]   Instead of some writer watching them post, thanks for the input.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:15.440]   I think all the evidence is we're still well protected from serious illness.
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.360]   Not from getting it, but from serious illness.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.960]   That's really the most important thing.
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:23.160]   I think I'll wear a mask on the plane.
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:24.160]   I think I will.
[02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:25.160]   Certainly...
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:26.160]   Oh, I want the Toronto...
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:29.320]   I was the only person in the United Lounge wearing a mask.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.880]   I think in those public areas...
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:35.120]   I'm still wearing the mask because RSV and flu are rampant and absolutely another...
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:37.120]   I'm happy to not get RSV.
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:38.120]   Why not?
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.120]   I'm not...
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.240]   I don't mind a mask.
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:44.280]   Will I wear it in the Vatican?
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.240]   I think I'll be protected, won't I?
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.800]   Actually, we should mention after talking about his big jacket, the Pope is in the hospital
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:54.560]   with a respiratory infection, so I hope he's okay.
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.680]   Will you get to see Padre and Rome?
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:57.680]   Yes.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:59.080]   That would be so cool.
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:00.080]   Very much looking forward to that.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.080]   I know somebody who works here.
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.080]   Are you going to get to see the observatory?
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:06.160]   I heard the Vatican Observatory is quite rare.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:07.560]   I will ask Father Robert.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.560]   I don't know.
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.560]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:10.560]   It's supposed to be great.
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:12.280]   He says he can get us in some places.
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:13.440]   He can do that.
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.440]   So that's good.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.680]   Let me make a note of that.
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:16.680]   Put that on my...
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:17.680]   The same case.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:22.000]   The article in New York Times, but the Vatican Observatory has done some...
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.560]   They've done some great exploration.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:24.560]   They're well regarded.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:25.560]   It's a...
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:26.560]   Is that hysterical?
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:27.560]   Is that hysterical?
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:32.200]   It's not what you'd expect, is it?
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:34.880]   The Jesuits are very...
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.680]   The Jesuits believe in evolution.
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:40.520]   I mean, it's an interesting thing, you know, going on there.
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:45.200]   Anyway, pick of the week time, Mr. Glenn Fleischman.
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.200]   Do you have anything worse?
[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:50.840]   Well, I think of the week as Trader Joe's, everything but the bagel potato chips.
[02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:52.760]   God bless them.
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:55.160]   That's a good pick.
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.120]   That is the best thing I'm afraid they're going to have to...
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:06.120]   I want them to put a picture up of me at the store that says, "Do not sell to this pig."
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:07.120]   Where is she?
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.120]   Well, B, what the Dean...
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:11.600]   It all started with the everything but the bagel seasoning.
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:12.600]   Which is...
[02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:15.280]   It's a huge hit for them.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:16.280]   It's really good.
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.280]   Yeah.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.280]   And then this...
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.080]   Oh, I wish you hadn't told me that.
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:21.080]   It's a drug.
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:22.080]   I'm really sorry.
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:25.440]   I had somebody on a shock, if you know, a shock on a mastodon.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.440]   I was posting about it.
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:27.680]   And he said, "I'm about to go..."
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:29.400]   It's about 15 minutes from about to drive it.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.800]   So remember to get a bag for the way home too.
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:32.800]   He's an old.
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:33.800]   Thank you.
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:34.800]   Oh, God!
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:35.800]   Oh, man, I wouldn't have forgotten that.
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:37.960]   It's a bad sign.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:39.120]   Holy moly!
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.120]   It's delicious.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.120]   Okay.
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:42.120]   I'm not paid representative.
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:43.120]   I'm a sufferer.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:44.120]   I'm a victim.
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:48.120]   A victim of everything but the bagel.
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:49.120]   So good.
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:50.120]   What is it?
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.920]   Is it everything but the bagel if it has chips?
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:54.920]   I guess it is still everything but the bagel plus chips.
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:58.600]   Yeah, it's good stuff.
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.200]   Mr. Jarvis, do you have a snack pick?
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:05.200]   No, I think we should do snack picks of the week now that I'm...
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:07.360]   No, we've gone down that road.
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.360]   Snack every week?
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:09.360]   No, no, no.
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:10.360]   I'm not...
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.360]   Snack of the week.
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:12.360]   No, I have one.
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.360]   It's a spare rib.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:15.360]   Ooh.
[02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:18.360]   That's like a snack of the week.
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:21.000]   I should make the cardio mobile.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.880]   Yeah, so seriously, are you telling me what's going on?
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:24.880]   Are you feeling symptoms?
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:25.880]   I'm not fine.
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:26.880]   No, fine.
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:27.880]   But, yeah, I was.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:30.200]   Before the show or during the show?
[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:32.800]   Just to the show began, I said, "Oh, oh."
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:34.440]   And then I ran off for a minute.
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:39.920]   I had to get a battery for this and take my pills early and got it working.
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:40.920]   This thing is...
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:41.920]   That's amazing.
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:42.920]   That's from cardiac.
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:43.920]   ARDIA.
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.080]   And of course, they're in the middle of a lawsuit with Apple who says you stole our
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:51.840]   idea and it's going back and forth.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:52.840]   It works.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:53.840]   Did you send the...
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:56.640]   Of course, it's not a full AKG but it's something.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.840]   Did you send it to your cardiologist for review?
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:03.160]   No, because he's working at seven o'clock in the clock.
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:04.160]   No, it's not.
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:07.760]   Well, I mean, the cardiologist is it.
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:08.760]   Yeah.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:10.160]   He endorses it and thinks it's working.
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:12.360]   So anyway, that's not it.
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:20.440]   I do want to mention that I've been waiting for Kevin to review the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook.
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:21.960]   Those are beautiful.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.360]   They're beautiful, but then there was one report that the battery life was like two
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:26.360]   and a half hours.
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:27.360]   I don't know if you can do that.
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:28.360]   No, Kevin.
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:29.360]   Kevin.
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:30.360]   Same, same.
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:33.000]   Kevin Tople came in and explained, no, no, no, no.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.280]   If you did this and this and this and the screen is so bright, you're never going to
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.280]   want it on a house.
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:39.280]   Yeah, okay.
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:41.480]   If you did that, yeah, but otherwise you're going to get eight hours.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:42.480]   It's okay.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.480]   So it's very tempting.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.040]   It's a thousand dollars.
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:46.040]   Yeah.
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.720]   Well, it's cheaper than the HP Dragonfly version, which was $1,200.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:51.720]   Yeah.
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:52.720]   So that's better.
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:57.960]   I don't know if you need a 12th gen i5 in a Chromebook, but...
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:00.200]   Oh, I want the best.
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:01.960]   We all have to reserve the best.
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:02.960]   Yeah, 16 gigs of random.
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:03.960]   I am the best.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.160]   I need to stir this good stuff.
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:07.160]   The best.
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:08.160]   Yeah.
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.800]   So much horsepower to be in a browser.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:10.800]   Come on.
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:12.360]   Well, remember the browser.
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:13.560]   A lot of tabs, sir.
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.960]   A lot of tabs.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:15.960]   It's the chrome.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.960]   Okay.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.760]   So he says the battery life is pretty.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:21.720]   He was, he got 10 hours and 21 minutes, which is pretty good.
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:22.720]   Yeah.
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:27.720]   So it's not a big battery, though.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:29.360]   No, it's not.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:30.640]   So then I just want to plug.
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:37.920]   I was in a, and a Kitchener Waterloo on Saturday doing the bait.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:38.920]   Guess what?
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.880]   Is social media ruining democracy?
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.800]   You can guess what side I was on.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.480]   So there's a little clip there in my...
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:46.800]   Should we play it?
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:51.560]   There were very nice people on TVO, the kind of PBS of Ontario.
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.360]   Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.800]   It's only 58 minutes long, so enjoy.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:56.800]   No, no, it should be.
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:57.800]   No, it should be.
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:58.800]   It should be the one I entered.
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:25:59.800]   That was short.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:00.960]   The one on Twitter is short.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:01.960]   Oh, okay.
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:02.960]   I clicked the...
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:05.320]   What I put in Twitter is just a little sound bite.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:07.760]   God, I clicked the wrong.
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:11.960]   No, if for some reason it's going to that YouTube, all right?
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:12.960]   It is?
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:13.960]   Yeah, that's all right.
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:14.960]   Let me copy the...
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.960]   It's a little...
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:16.960]   It's a thing.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:17.960]   Twitter's going to hell.
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:18.960]   We keep telling you.
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:19.960]   Yeah.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:20.960]   Here we go.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:22.560]   It's not because you're animated.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.400]   Well, yes, I bang the furniture, too.
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.800]   We have met the enemy and it is us.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:28.800]   It is not technology.
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:30.280]   It is not machines.
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.960]   It is the bill in our own society that we carry into this medium from our past.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:41.320]   It is the inequity and the hatred and the racism that we bring with us that matters.
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:47.520]   So to blame the technology is to stop us from dealing with these core issues in society.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.520]   Yeah!
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:49.520]   Right on, JJ!
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:50.520]   Tell it!
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:56.720]   If I were a Twitter user, I'd retweet that.
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.560]   So let me put it on Mastodon.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:00.560]   I was next to...
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:01.560]   I already have it on Mastodon.
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.560]   You can retoot you.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.560]   You can boost me there.
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:08.240]   So that's Robbie Swave, a reason magazine was my co-...
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:10.520]   Oh, I actually like reason.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:13.680]   I know it's a libertarian a little bit, but I really like reason.
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:14.680]   Yeah.
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:15.680]   I like Robbie a lot.
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.680]   I liked him.
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:17.680]   He wrote a book called...
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:19.480]   His book out called "Text Flash."
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:20.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:21.480]   "Text Panic."
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:25.920]   You know, I'm an like this guy when he writes a book called "Text Panic!"
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:26.920]   "Text Panic!"
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:34.000]   So the deal of these debates is whoever changes enough minds in the audience wins.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.840]   So when we started off, it was 76 to 24 against us.
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:43.040]   But at the end, it was only 60/40 against us, so we won the new.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:44.040]   Oh, good.
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:45.040]   Even though you lost.
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:46.040]   Nice Canadians.
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.040]   But you moved more...
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.040]   We won.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.040]   We moved to the needle.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:52.400]   We lost but won.
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.400]   I hope you get a recount.
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:58.520]   That is a great little clip and I am retooting it right now.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:27:59.520]   That's a really excellent...
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:00.520]   Exactly.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:02.400]   The really, really nice folks at TVO.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.320]   And what is your snack of the week?
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.240]   I don't have one.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:09.240]   I've got one.
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:10.240]   You can fly.
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:11.240]   You can fly.
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.040]   In honor of the missing Stacy.
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.040]   Raisins?
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:16.760]   Daleman's Stroop Waffles.
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.760]   Oh, man.
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:20.560]   Those are so damn good.
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:25.200]   You put it on your coffee cup to warm it up and melt the caramel.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:26.200]   And it is.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:27.200]   It is good.
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.200]   Eat those all United Airlines.
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:31.280]   Do you have some more of those at the studio, sir?
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.280]   Those are so good.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:35.320]   Okay, so the thing you've got to watch out for with the Dutch though is they'll allow
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.320]   you to eat licorice and that's a problem.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.760]   You can't eat licorice if you've got high blood pressure.
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:40.760]   Don't do that.
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:41.760]   It's so salty.
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:42.760]   It'll kill you.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:43.760]   Yeah.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]   Dutch.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.760]   I like the Australian licorice.
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.720]   That's a little less salty.
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:50.120]   Finish licorice is the worst though.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:52.280]   Finish is like eating a pickle.
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.280]   It's not a fish.
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:55.280]   A licorice flavored pickle.
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:56.280]   It's not good.
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:57.280]   Stroop waffles.
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:00.080]   Yeah, we used to have these in the studio, didn't we?
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.080]   Yes.
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.480]   I think we stopped because we were afraid it was going to kill people.
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:05.480]   No, it won't.
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:06.480]   All right.
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:11.880]   Sebastian, we need a Stroop Waffles recipe.
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:12.880]   Careful.
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.440]   Very careful.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:15.760]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:17.760]   And now it's time for Aunt Pruitt's.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.680]   Think of the week.
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:23.640]   My pick, first one is very, very simple.
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:27.440]   And I just want you to go ahead and put one of these at your desk.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.920]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.920]   Yes.
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:31.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:32.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:33.920]   A very, very simple dumbbell.
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:35.720]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:37.080]   You call me a dumbbell.
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:38.080]   Chippish.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:39.080]   That is two pounds.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:40.080]   That's five pounds.
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.080]   Half a pound.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:42.080]   Half a pound.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:43.080]   10 pounds.
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:44.080]   Five pounds.
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:45.080]   10 pounds.
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:46.080]   Just put one of those in.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.080]   And then what do I do?
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:48.920]   I just leave it there to hold down papers and things.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:50.600]   You can leave it there to hold down papers.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.600]   All right, Aunt.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:52.960]   Do you have one next to your desk now?
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:56.480]   I have one next to me on the couch when I'm watching television, sir.
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.120]   So I'm using them.
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:00.360]   So yeah, just pick one up.
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:02.160]   Whiskey and one hand barbell of the other.
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:03.160]   Is that how it works?
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:04.160]   That's it.
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:06.840]   And knock out 10 to 15 at a time.
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:07.840]   What do you recommend?
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:09.880]   Are we doing skull crushers?
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.960]   Are we doing arnolds?
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:13.720]   Start with some simple bicep curls.
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:14.720]   Some bicep curls.
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:15.720]   Single arm bicep curls.
[02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:16.720]   Okay.
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:17.720]   Just do ten of those.
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:18.720]   Okay.
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:20.720]   You know, when you're waiting on something to render on the screen.
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:24.440]   I used to do that when I was sitting on my exercise ball, my yoga ball at doing Windows
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:25.440]   Weekly.
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.440]   I would do those.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:28.880]   Lisa gave you hers.
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.480]   She didn't want them.
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:31.480]   We have them at home.
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.080]   We have a whole set at home.
[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:34.080]   I'll keep it by.
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.080]   I will.
[02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:36.160]   What do you suggest for me?
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:37.480]   I'm a pretty strong fellow.
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:38.480]   Maybe a...
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.280]   Do they have a one pound version?
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:41.280]   No.
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:43.680]   You better not go lower than five pounds, sir.
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:44.680]   Okay.
[02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:45.680]   You better not go lower than five pounds.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:46.680]   Now you like these?
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:47.680]   They have a good grip.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:48.680]   Is that why?
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:49.680]   Nice.
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:50.680]   Yeah, preen.
[02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:51.920]   Well, actually just any of them.
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.560]   I don't care which one you get.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:59.680]   My point is just folks don't necessarily have to go and spend $30 plus a month on a gym membership
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:07.000]   when they can do something simple like that at the leisure at their desk or on the couch.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.680]   I tried to tell people to do pushups and they whine and say, "I can't do pushups."
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:15.400]   Well, you can get a 10 pound dumbbell or a 5 pound dumbbell and just press it for shoulder
[02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:20.360]   presses or do some curls throughout the day and get yourself a nice little burn and
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:21.360]   keep your heart rate going.
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:27.080]   When I'm watching the succession, I like to do the 35-put kettlebell into the...
[02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:28.080]   Little bell.
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:29.080]   The goblet squat.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:30.080]   Oh, wow.
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.080]   Yes.
[02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:33.320]   It'll put some head on your hold...
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:34.320]   Holders.
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:35.320]   Stop.
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:40.320]   I don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:46.720]   Swing that between your legs and see how you feel.
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.360]   No, I think that's good advice.
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:52.480]   Just what the thing is, and Lisa's realized this recently, you don't have to do an hour
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:54.560]   that you can do 15 minutes, four times a day.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:55.560]   You can spread it out.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:56.560]   You can do it when it's going to be.
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:01.720]   Do a couple of sit-ups while you're watching Furby and Fanny as Infirm and just keep it
[02:32:01.720 --> 02:32:02.720]   moving.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:03.720]   Keep it moving.
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.720]   Flexbell.
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:07.800]   I know a lot of folks here aren't watching March Madness and end of sports and stuff like
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:08.800]   that.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:11.680]   I'm watching whatever television show that you're watching.
[02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:12.680]   Succession.
[02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:16.760]   When the ad break comes up, do some type of movement.
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.720]   We don't have ads on my TV.
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:24.040]   Whether it's the standing squats where this push-ups, just do something during that break
[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:25.040]   time.
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:26.040]   I will.
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:27.040]   I'm going to have a Stroop Waffle.
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:28.040]   That's what I'm going to do.
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.960]   Yeah, or you have that as a reward.
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:36.400]   At the end of the show, have a bag of everything but the bagel chips and a Stroop Waffle.
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:39.880]   And then get the Cardia because you will be in a gym.
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:40.880]   Yeah.
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:42.440]   No, that's good advice.
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:43.440]   I think you're right.
[02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:44.640]   I think they just keep moving.
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.880]   Is this just keep moving.
[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:46.880]   Yeah, not hard.
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:47.880]   Yeah.
[02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:52.160]   Lastly, I want to give a shout out to Miss Bonica Brown.
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:54.160]   She is a powerlifting.
[02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:55.160]   Holy cow.
[02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:56.160]   I saw this video.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:00.360]   She's got the best dad gun Instagram ever.
[02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:05.880]   But she set the record in squats for 617.
[02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:06.880]   No, come on.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:08.680]   And she crushed it.
[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:10.960]   Absolutely crushed that record.
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:12.200]   But follow her on Instagram.
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:13.200]   She's a fun follow.
[02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:18.160]   It does a lot of little crazy stuff, but just she's also getting into showing her workouts
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:19.520]   and things like that.
[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:26.600]   If you click to the left on that, she has her bench press from that as well as her deadlift.
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:29.360]   Her deadlift is just ridiculous too.
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:31.360]   If you click left, I don't understand.
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:32.840]   You're saying a little bit of a arrow.
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.360]   There's no arrow on this.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:35.360]   It's just one.
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:36.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:37.360]   There's no left.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.360]   What is that?
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:40.760]   You're just messing with me, aren't you?
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.280]   Just come on.
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.160]   Leo, you know, just click left.
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:46.360]   Is it on my screen?
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.040]   I don't know what you did.
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:50.840]   I don't know either.
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:54.080]   Well, anyway, shout out to her.
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:58.440]   She absolutely crushed the powerlifting record there.
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:33:59.440]   That's awesome.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:00.440]   Just last week.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.440]   So give her a follow.
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:04.160]   She's good people too.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:07.960]   I could do that with a one pound dumbbell.
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:08.960]   Do that.
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:11.320]   Do that about a thousand times, sir.
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:16.400]   You may get to her warm up say, yeah, really.
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:17.400]   Unbelievable.
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:20.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us for this edition of this week in
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:21.120]   Google Glen Fleischman.
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:23.320]   Always great to see you.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:29.000]   When dot fun, you implied that there might be pirated versions of your jeopardy appearance
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000]   somewhere.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000]   Possible.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000]   It's possible.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.480]   Wouldn't be on YouTube, though, probably, right?
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:34.480]   It would be.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:37.560]   I don't think the secrets, there used to be a daily motion.
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.880]   Used to have a lot of old jeopardy stuff too.
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:42.160]   I would love to watch you on Jeopardy.
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:43.880]   Maybe they do old shows.
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.160]   Maybe they'll just bring it back by chance.
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:50.840]   I'll be sitting there, lifting my one pound weight, and there'll be my friend Glenn.
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:51.840]   I like to actually.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:53.320]   I do it when I'm rowing.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:54.320]   I do it when I'm rowing.
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:35:03.720]   I do two Jeopardies in a row while I'm rowing because then I'm working my brain and my glutes.
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.960]   Some people say the same thing.
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.600]   Can I do a round of the slide?
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:09.640]   There's a joke in there, but I'm not going to.
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:10.640]   Plug it.
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:11.640]   Plug away.
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.880]   So on April to the system, very Glenn thing, on April 22, if you're near Columbus, Ohio,
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:22.680]   I'll be doing a part of an afternoon workshop at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library Museum
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:28.680]   at the Ohio State University talking about how comics were printed with actual materials
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:33.920]   from the Billy Ireland collection and my own collection showing all the pieces that it
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:39.440]   requires to go from an artist board from originals through all the print production methods
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:41.400]   to going into a newspaper.
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:43.400]   So they're doing a whole afternoon.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:48.400]   This is part of the exhibition, Man Saves Comics, about the great Bill Blackbeard now,
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:53.320]   deceased who collected millions of comics, pages and strips that were being discarded
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:56.760]   by libraries and other institutions.
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:01.000]   Sometimes the only copies, often the only copies of those comics across 100 plus years
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.440]   of cartoons that survived because he was a pack rat.
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:08.280]   And they're all at the Billy Ireland now.
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:15.560]   Six trailer truck, old 75 tons of comics were transferred to the library 25 years ago and
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:19.000]   they were celebrating that with an exhibition and I've got a video in there showing stuff
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.640]   and I'll be there in person.
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:22.040]   So what are you bringing?
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:23.840]   They bring us some flongs and stuff.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.240]   They've got some flongs.
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:26.240]   I've got some flongs.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:27.600]   It's going to be a good time.
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:31.640]   They've got original art too, so they can show the whole, we'll show the whole stage, the
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:32.640]   whole process.
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:33.640]   Oh neat.
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.800]   Because it says it'll be a drop in show and tell with printed storing and flychements.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:40.920]   So you're going to bring some stuff from your collection and some stuff from there.
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:43.400]   So I'll bring some flongs.
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.960]   If you're in Columbus, actually this would be worth a trip if you ask me.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.240]   The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum part of the Ohio State.
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:52.720]   And we're driving through Columbus.
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:53.720]   You should stop through.
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:54.720]   They do exhibitions.
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:55.720]   They have constantly of exhibitions.
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:57.000]   They last for months through time.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.480]   And just an incredible, it's incredible that we have an institution like that that is actually
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:05.680]   publicly supported in the sense that the Ohio State University is a public institution
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:10.700]   in that state to support comic arts, an incredible, very American thing.
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:13.440]   Other countries, the national governments think it's important enough.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:15.760]   Like in France, there's Anguilim.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:19.480]   Has an amazing center that I haven't been to, but everyone talks about.
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:22.040]   And we've got the Billy Ireland.
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:24.120]   Very, very cool.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:28.000]   Cartoons.osu.edu.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.160]   Thank you, Glenn.
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:30.160]   Always love having you on the show.
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:31.160]   I appreciate it.
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:32.920]   I think we'll see more of you while I'm gone.
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:34.960]   And I'm sorry I won't be here for that.
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:36.960]   But everybody else will be, I hope.
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:38.120]   I'll be back.
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:42.960]   Jeff Jarvis, you know I'm better as the director of the Townite Center of Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:50.680]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:52.520]   I hope you try.
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:53.520]   I hope you're feeling better.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:54.520]   Come back.
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:55.520]   Come back.
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:56.520]   Oh, I will come back.
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.080]   Are you kidding?
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:59.840]   Wouldn't miss that for the world.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:04.720]   And I'm putting in here right now, the Vatican.
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:05.720]   What was it?
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:06.720]   Planetarium?
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:07.720]   Observatory.
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:11.000]   I don't know how open it is to the public, but if you've got a positive sign.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000]   Well, maybe.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.160]   Podrick, get me in there.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:18.880]   And knock on the door three times and say Galileo was right in the lecture.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:19.880]   Just speak easy.
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:22.080]   Don't say Galileo is right.
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.080]   They'll burn you the steak.
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.080]   What are you talking about?
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.720]   So it's a pair of C. Moore of A, a move that does move.
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:30.720]   It does move.
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.720]   That's what he said.
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:32.720]   It does move.
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:36.920]   I think is the Italian.
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.720]   What do you got coming up on hands-off photography?
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.720]   Mr. Antprote?
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:45.720]   Well, actually I am doing a demo of this camera right here.
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:47.880]   Is that the new Sony?
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.880]   Oh, it looks.
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:52.520]   This is the Lumix S5 Mark II.
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.880]   And I'm going to share my thoughts on that.
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:54.880]   And you are right.
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:02.680]   Sony did announce a new camera today to ZV1, ZV-V-V-V-1 with the C. Moore of A, a new
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.280]   camera, which is a four-frame version of the previous ZV line.
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.120]   And I haven't taken too much of a thorough look at it just yet, but that was announced
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:12.120]   today.
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:14.040]   And maybe I get my hands on one and play with it.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.000]   But that's what's coming up this week on the show is the Lumix S5 Mark II.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:24.000]   And also, since you're going to be gone, I'm going to be sitting in your chair on this
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000]   past the test.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.640]   Guys with Mr. Microsoft.
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.080]   So all of you Twig folks listening right now, feel free to send your video questions
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:33.080]   to us.
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:36.960]   Just shoot an email to askdetectguys@twit.tv.
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:41.600]   And maybe we'll give you a holler on Sunday.
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.600]   That's awesome.
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:44.440]   Yeah, you're filling in for me and all over the place.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:45.960]   And I appreciate you're doing that.
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:46.960]   Thank you.
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:47.960]   Thank you.
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:48.960]   My pleasure, sir.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:54.320]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, around about 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:55.320]   2100 UTC.
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.280]   You can watch us live at live.twit.tv.
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:39:59.280]   There's also an audio feed.
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:05.040]   If you want to listen live, if you're watching or listening live, chat live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:08.400]   Club members can of course chat in the discord.
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:10.880]   If you're not a club member, Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:12.400]   Thank you club members.
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:17.440]   After the fact on demand, ad supported versions are at the website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:21.400]   You can also, there's a YouTube channel you can find and watch.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.360]   And it's a good way to share little clips if you want to do that.
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:29.200]   Best way to find all of our YouTube channels is go to the main channel, youtube.com/twit.
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:32.120]   You'll see links to all the other shows, channels there.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:35.760]   And of course, the easiest thing to do, the thing I would do right now before you forget
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.000]   is find your favorite podcast player, pocket casts over casts, Google or Apple casts, and
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.400]   subscribe to this week in Google.
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:44.880]   That way you don't have to think about it.
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:46.040]   Just downloads automatically.
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.960]   You can listen to it whenever you're in the mood for silliness.
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:54.400]   Is, let's see, is next week is Stacy, no, Stacy's not going to be back.
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:55.400]   Or is she?
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:56.400]   She is.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.400]   Nope.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:01.440]   Next week is just like today, sans, sans me, still a port.
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:02.440]   Okay.
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:06.000]   And Mike is going to have Mr. Michael Sargent as the host.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.360]   And then the following week, Jason, Jeff, Stacy and aunt, so Jason, how we'll take over
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:12.360]   in fact for two weeks.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:15.320]   And then I'll be back on the 26th.
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:23.720]   If you do want to follow my perigrenations, I am posting on a site called Polar Steps.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:30.480]   If you go to polarsteps.com/loports, plural, Lisa and I have used polar steps in the past
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:37.520]   to kind of, it uses your phones GPS to figure out where you are and takes pictures and puts
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:41.760]   it all together into a triptych or a travel map.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.960]   It's open to the public.
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:43.960]   I know it's crazy.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.240]   I probably shouldn't do it, but I will be posting.
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:48.760]   I don't want to post on Instagram.
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:52.120]   I want to, and Lisa probably will post on Instagram, so follow her on Instagram.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.120]   I'm not posting on Twitter.
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:56.080]   I probably won't even post on Massadon or PixelFed.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.440]   They'll just go here and if you want to follow along, you can see where we are at any given
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.840]   moment and try not to jump us as we leave the hotel, though.
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:06.480]   I would appreciate that.
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:07.480]   And what was that link again?
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:10.000]   So I'll make sure we have it in the shows notes here.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.440]   Polarsteps.com/loports.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.200]   You know what I will put it in there?
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:21.240]   As my pick, not Stroup Waffles, I will replace this Stroup Waffles with Pora Steps.
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:25.240]   Yeah, it's kind of a cool sight, and then you can make a book afterwards and stuff.
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:27.480]   I'd be actually curious what you think of it.
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:30.720]   I'll make some books so you can see what the quality is.
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:34.120]   Follow Lisa and Leo as they travel.
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:36.400]   Have a wonderful couple of weeks, folks.
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.800]   I'll be back in a little less than a month.
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:43.480]   I will miss you all, but I will be rested and ready to go.
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:46.680]   In my brain, I'm hoping we'll be a little more functional when I'm back.
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.680]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:49.880]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:50.380]   Bye-bye.
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:54.620]   [MUSIC]
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:58.020]   If you love all things, Android, well, I'm going to show for you to check out.
[02:42:58.020 --> 02:43:01.540]   It's called All About Android, and I'll give you three guesses what we talk about.
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:05.340]   We talk about Android, the latest news, hardware, apps.
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.340]   We answer feedback.
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:12.500]   It's me, Jason, how'll Ron Richards, WinTwitDow, and a whole cast of awesome characters talking
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:14.940]   about the operating system that we love.
[02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:18.580]   You can find all about Android at twit.tv/aa.
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:28.580]   [MUSIC]
[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:30.660]   you
