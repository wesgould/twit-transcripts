[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Coming up next on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo. I'm here with Stacey Higginbotham and Kevin Tofol.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We talk about the price of your face, improving voice detection for toddlers.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   We take a look. Kevin takes a look at the Firewalla. There's a whole bunch of chrome news.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And also the Justice Department anti-trust review. We talk a little bit about that.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   There's so much more up next on Twig.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is Twig.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's time for This Week in Google. I'm Jason Halifilian for Leo Laporte, who is vacationing somewhere in this country,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   this fine, fine country right now. Definitely not on the show today.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   But joining me on the show, of course, the return Stacey Higginbotham, creator of the IOT podcast and IOT podcast.com
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and the Internet of Things newsletter at Stacey on IOT.com. How are you Stacey?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Man, I'm great. You did that all-in-one breath. You get a prize.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You know, my lung capacity. I've been working on it.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Working on it just so that I can introduce you once again. It's good to see you again.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Like what I did.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And the new setup. I don't know if that I've seen the new setup.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, yes. This is my I've moved to Washington State, living on Bainbridge Island setup.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I like it. Looks good. It's good to see you. Also joining us, Jeff is out this week.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So filling in Jeff's shoes. I don't know if they were the same shoe size, but Kevin Tofel about Chromebooks.com
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and also IOT podcast.com. How are you doing Kevin?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yes. I'm good. I can guarantee you that I do not fit into Jeff's shoes literally or figuratively.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I look like crap today. I'm working on my Wi-Fi after a device review today.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So hopefully that will clear up over time.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's all right. You don't look like crap. You look great.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You do. You look, you're in soft focus. Yes. Boba, Boba, Wawa Focus.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's a new security thing to fuzz out my face so that way nobody can, you know, use it for machine learning and such.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yes. Just a little Vaseline on the lens.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   This is intentional. Well, it's good to have you.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You also got a new pair of glasses, but we may hopefully later in the show get a clearer view of the glasses.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But in blurry form, they look great.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Hey, I can see fine, you know. So I'm good.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah. Right on. Well, it's good to have you both here.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And I'm happy to hop on with y'all on this week in Google.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Where do we even begin?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I'm scanning through trying to find the obvious thing.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, actually, okay. So when you've got a blurry video feed like you do, Kevin Tofill,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   then it prevents people from scanning your face.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And so that'll be my segue into this, the top story that I chose on the fly.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Did you hear this story about someone who apparently was propositioned $5 for a face scan by a Google employee?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So apparently your face is only worth $5.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I guess that kind of seems- That's actually quite a bit.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Is it? I feel like it seems low, but-
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You know, they did a study probably in 2020, either 2012 or 2014,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   where they bought people's social security number for a cookie.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So- Okay. I feel like- By comparison- Wait, what flavor?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It was a chocolate chip cookie. Okay, that's a problem.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   That is plenty. All right.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So, I mean- It's a good trade.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's more of a barter as opposed to a dollar figure, but I feel that $5 for a face is fair.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   What did strike me is the fact that this guy was like-
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And it's not $5 cash. It's $5 Starbucks or Amazon, I believe.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Was it Amazon? Gift card. Yes, Amazon or Starbucks, right?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah. Which I thought was hilarious because, you know,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Amazon probably could use some faces themselves.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That's true.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Someone notable that they're not giving out their own Play Store gift cards,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   but also that makes a whole lot of sense that they wouldn't do that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Can I buy $5 on the Play Store?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I mean, $5 aside, if this person or anybody offers $5 for Google to do that,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   does Google still have the right to scan their face in other photos and such?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Like, are they getting other than the $5?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Are they getting any extra privacy over their data?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That's a really good question. Like, I have to imagine-
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   What happened, at least in the ZDNet story, and I think there was one on 95 Google,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   another person that, you know, they had a report of this happening,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   but they were sitting in the park. Man walks up to them and offers $5 to scan their face.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They say, "I work for Google. We're collecting data to improve the next generation of facial recognition phone unlocking."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So, pretty- I mean, reasonably specific as far as what they're saying that they're using it for.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Who knows if they have more and more uses for this face scan than just that,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   but that's what they're telling people. And then they were given a phone in a case that made it difficult
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   to discern what the phone was. Many people are positing that it might be the Pixel 4,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   because there might be a sensor on the Pixel 4 that would facilitate face scanning in order to unlock.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Then you use the phone to take a selfie at different angles, to get the different kind of direction shots on your face,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and then you're handed this $5 Amazon and Starbucks card.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I have to imagine if you're agreeing to this, you must either sign something or maybe there's something in the app that you're taking the selfie with.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They did give him a contract. He just didn't read it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Which is unfortunate, because I'm trying to-
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's too bad.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   For $5, I would like to see what you're giving over.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yes.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He's writing about his friend who's an engineer.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Right.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Who's probably like, "Yeah, I'll give him my face."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Yeah, probably one of those. They've already got everything. So, what's my face?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah, his exact quote was, "Yeah, well, I wanted to see what they'd ask me to do."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I don't care what they're going to do with it. I just want to know what they want me to do.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Sure, yes.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Sure.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I mean, without seeing the contract, we don't know much more.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I'm actually wondering if this wasn't a face scan, but a face scam.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Oh.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   In that maybe this wasn't Google at all.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Aha, because that's a really good question.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, why would Google have to go out and do this when they have between contractors and regular employees, you know, 80, 90,000 faces to scan already?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Well, I don't really see the point of them going out in the public and doing this.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   What they don't have is someone playing with their phone trying to unlock it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   That's what this was for. This was, I'm with Jason. I think this was testing the Pixel 4's unlock feature.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And so, they needed someone to be able to kind of look at it from various angles.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Huh.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah, that could well be. But, I mean, when I was at Google, most of the people I worked with actually carried iPhones.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So if you wanted like a new user group, you got it there.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Trust me, if they have it.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Yeah, and I don't know that I read anything about them actually, like in this report, there was nothing in there that said that he was actually unlocking the phone with his face.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They were just scanning it for multiple directions.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I just wasn't sure if, you know, they were actually using the Pixel 4.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   No, I'm not sure that we've heard Google say anything.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   If it was a scam, they probably would have by now.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   This is an assumption.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I naturally ask Google what it would be doing, but the company didn't immediately respond.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Okay.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Okay.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   All right.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Let's call Google. Let's see what they have to say right now.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Right now.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I wish, you know, that would be so awesome if we had a hotline, like a bat phone to the Google PR team.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It'd probably be the PR team.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But we had an actual Google person who would talk to us.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'd be even better.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   We would do it like three, maybe four times before we realized they always give us the same hands.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I think that's more effective actually.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Just, you know, okay.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   We have nothing to announce at this time.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   We have nothing to announce at this time.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Okay.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Well, that bit is done.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I guess we're done with that one.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   But I am curious to know what this leads to.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Kevin, I had the same question.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It's kind of like Google is already cataloging all this information in the cloud, like insane amounts of data and on faces with Google photos and all that.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And all this kind of stuff.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's not like they don't have plenty of data to work with.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But, you know, maybe it's just the fact that that data hasn't been cleared for this particular application.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And in this way, it's a little more explicit, maybe kind of above board in doing it in such an explicit sort of way.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Or maybe like this guy doesn't say if his friend, I mean, is this friend white?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Is this friend black?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Is this friend, you know, because there is.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   There is a variety angle that could be important here in terms of.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Two heads.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Does he have two heads that is.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah, there's probably not a lot of data about that.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   What if he has no face like no face at all, you know, a blank face possible.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Not very possible.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I feel like we're moving down a rabbit hole.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   We shouldn't go down.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   All right.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Yes.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I think you're right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   We're talking about faceless face scans.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   We're done.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.

[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.

[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I was going to say I am excited about the Pixel 4 because I just cracked my Pixel 2.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It's not a huge crack, so I can handle it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But I'm like, "It's almost time to upgrade my phone."
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Did you exactly?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Will I get the display or the back?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I cracked the display.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   You could get pretty much the same phone with the headphone jack right now.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   That's the honor?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   The 3A.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The 3A is just as fast as the 2.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's got a headphone jack and I love it.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I did get more people to buy it.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You are.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   You're like everybody else.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I see.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Get on the bandwagon.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Come on.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   3A forever.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   How much is the 3A?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Carsten?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   $400.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   $400.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   $400.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   $4.79.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   If you get the expanded storage version, if I remember correctly,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   which you probably want to do if you're getting the phone.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The base is 64, which I think is not that bad.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Yeah, it's got 9.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Expanded is 128, which is nice.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It does have the same camera.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It has the same.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It has the same.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It has better camera than yours than yours currently.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So, no, no, no.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   So, no, no, no.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It really does have a -- so it has a headphone jack and USB-C.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Yeah, it has a headphone jack and USB-C and the same camera as the 3.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I sold.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And it's -- oh, it's so nice.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It is a really great phone.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I'm sure I told you about this phone much ago.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I know.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But I didn't need it and I don't remember it.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I wasn't in the market then.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Okay.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   My best.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Bad timing.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   It really is a fantastic phone, especially for the price.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I don't want the XL.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   $3.99.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   $3.99.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   All right.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Thank you, Carsten.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Or you can wait three months and find out what the 4 is all about.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   But who knows?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Maybe less than three months.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.320]   I have a hard time believing that Google would confirm the leaked images so early on and
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.120]   then wait practically six months until the phone gets announced.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   That seems like a long time for them to reveal something very solid as solid as they did
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.000]   when they confirmed those promo images a few months ago.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Well, we're within three months now.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   But not so we're --
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Two months and a week.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.240]   This feels about the time when we start getting hyped up for our full device cycle.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.640]   That hype is happening.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   The Note 10 and the Note 10 Plus, apparently there's going to be two different sizes of
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.800]   the Note 10.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.680]   And so there's going to be your super large Note 10 as we're used to.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.640]   And then an even larger Note 10 Plus, at least larger display.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.000]   Apparently they're going to fit it in the same design but just grow the display even
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.920]   further.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.320]   So you know, what does that mean from a cost perspective?
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.360]   Because the Note 9 already costs more than $1,000.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.960]   And if there's a larger Note 10 than the base Note 10, what are we talking about?
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   $1,300?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Really expensive.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.920]   You actually had the -- on the screen just now you have the rumored prices in euros of
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.360]   $9.99 and $11.99 or $11.49.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.080]   $11.49 in euros, whatever that is.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.880]   $11.49 for the $10 plus.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   There it is, okay.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   Right.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:58.800]   But chances are it's going to converge with switch to $999.49 in dollars is my guess.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   Okay.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   Still.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Still very expensive.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.760]   Still a lot of money no matter how you slice it.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.640]   That's three pixel three A's.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   That's true.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   I just got it.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   I'm like sold.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.600]   You can outfit your family.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.920]   Everyone with pixel three A's.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   I mean --
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   Well, it's a really great thing.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.560]   I've given this one to my daughter because the crack is at the very bottom of the screen.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.560]   Okay.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.880]   Put a screen protector on it in a case and you're fine.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   There's already a case.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   Although it's a live case and I'm sad because it's --
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   No more.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.040]   No more live cases.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.200]   That's right.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.800]   Poor one out for live case homies.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   Let's see here.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   What else do we have?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.280]   We've got a lot of things.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.720]   I think I'm overwhelmed with options.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   We have so many things.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.960]   We just don't have great segues.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   Yes.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   I'm like --
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Right.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.360]   I'm here looking like -- I apologize in advance.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.280]   I got a really bad night of sleep last night and I was doing Windows Weekly earlier today
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.200]   and I was just realizing while I was doing the show, it's been a long time since I've
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.960]   had this bad of a night of sleep that it's affecting me today.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.160]   I feel like normally I can just fly with it on these shows and I'm having a hard time
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160]   with my segues.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:17.320]   I'm just saying you could get your pixel too fixed but I don't know where you're going
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.880]   to be able to find an ad for -- Oh.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   --to find a business to fix it.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   You won't be able to do that.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   That was good.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   Oh, are we 20 minutes in?
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   Excellent.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   That was good.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   That was good.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.440]   So I think what you're talking about is not an in-house ad but an article by Kevin Purdy
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.160]   and I fix it.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.760]   So basically -- yeah, so this is interesting.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.960]   So Google had some rules that they implemented not too long ago.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:56.000]   I think this was last October that banned tech support by third party providers for
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.720]   consumer tech products and online services from actually appearing in search results.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.160]   And the idea here was to target what ends up being a lot of bait and switch operations.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.360]   Like, hey, clean your PC.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.480]   You do -- somebody hops online because their computer's really slow.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.600]   Like, repair my computer and you get a website for a place that is really just more of a
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   fraud offer than it is some sort of actual reputable repair company.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.280]   And so Google took action on this and actually has made it difficult next to impossible for
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.600]   companies like that to have display ads that appear in search results.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.280]   So if I'm in the Bay Area and I do a search for a local repair shop, I'm not going to
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   get ads for my local repair shop because they also fall into the same category or are being
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.800]   lumped into the same category as these fraud outfits.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.480]   And that's kind of the point of Kevin Purdy's article is, hey, that's not right.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.160]   There are a lot of legitimate repair outfits out there, repair businesses.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:09.120]   And they aren't getting the views that they need in Google search results in order for
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.240]   their businesses to thrive in the way other businesses can enjoy.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:20.280]   And it's just kind of interesting that this very legitimate segment of the electronics
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.200]   market is basically left out on the cold because Google has implemented something to clamp
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.720]   down on fraud outfits.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.040]   And this started actually almost a year ago, if I recall correctly.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.560]   It was October.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.560]   And last October.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   Okay.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.240]   So Google said they were going to have like a verification process to kind of weed out
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.880]   the good guys and the bad guys here.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.120]   But maybe they are still working on that process, but it doesn't sound like it shouldn't take
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   a year for that.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   I wouldn't think, especially if it's like consistently affecting these businesses like
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.720]   a year is a long time.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   And yeah, there could be.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.880]   How does the future of a business right there?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.680]   If you run in a business and you relied on that and then suddenly it's gone, a year
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.200]   could mean you're out of business.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   You're no longer a business.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.720]   So yeah, they had promised some sort of verification program.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.240]   It still does not exist.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.040]   And I don't think there's any indication whether Google is actually still working on
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.080]   it or they've just decided they want to make a decision.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.440]   Another messaging app.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   So it's also.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:29.080]   It gets to the issues that I mean, basically it's very easy to figure out how to game an
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080]   algorithm, right?
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.760]   It's easy for humans to figure out ways to game computers.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.640]   It's very hard for people to then come in and fix that in a way that doesn't affect
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.040]   everyone.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:46.000]   So I mean, yeah, we'll see this again and again.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.080]   It shows the power that Google has on the whole internet, even though they're just a subset
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   of it.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   I mean, sure.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.920]   Yeah, that's kind of scary.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:02.400]   It's actually led I fix it itself, which Kevin Purdy is writing for, to remove a referral
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   service that they had integrated into their site because they were being swept in it too.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.200]   They were putting users in touch with local certified text to help them out.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.880]   And because they were making that connection, Google kind of lumped them into this category.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.080]   So certain search terms, they wouldn't allow for them.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.520]   And so they had to remove it in order to appear for those search terms because I fix
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.200]   it, of course, is all about fixing your computers and your technology and all this kind of stuff.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.800]   So they are a part of it as well.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.960]   I'm actually talking with Kevin Purdy tomorrow on Tech News Weekly.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.000]   He's booked for the show.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.760]   So talk to him about this.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:48.000]   Yeah, it's an interesting byproduct of I think the goal here was good by Google, but the
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.200]   follow through apparently not so much.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.920]   We need a hotline to Danny Sullivan.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.080]   Yes, that's what the phone would connect to.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.360]   Our Google phone would connect to Danny Sullivan.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.320]   Yep, that's what we need.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Al Fuddsman.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   That's how we get them on the show again.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   There you go.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.720]   There are a bunch of, so all of the FTC approvals and the court case approvals for Google.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.200]   Do we want to talk about some of those?
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   Yeah, two.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.480]   One of them I'm super into and one of them I completely forgot about.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.640]   And I'm like, oh, which kind of shows how slow these things can be.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   No kidding.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   This is the court system.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.840]   Yeah, so you're talking about the number of lawsuits that seem to have all reached some
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.120]   sort of a settlement in the last week, right?
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   Yeah, all these things.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   Boom.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.880]   Hey, Google can feel like the weight of the world isn't resting so heavily on its shoulders.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.400]   Well, they're just about to get part of a swept up in another entity investigation.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.360]   But these are all...
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.200]   But you know, exactly.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.440]   Just clearing the path for something bigger.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.200]   Yeah, busy week for Google in the reaching settlements side of things.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.520]   Why spy, which dated back to 2010?
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.400]   I forgot totally about that.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.080]   That's where the Google Street View cars went through and took your pictures of everything
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.280]   for Street View, but they also sucked up your Wi-Fi access point data.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.800]   And apparently the settlement only goes to a couple of people who filed the case, which
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.240]   honestly makes sense because I'm not living, even if they sucked up my Wi-Fi data.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.720]   It's totally different, like, nine years later.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.840]   I'm too housed as removed from that situation.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   That's true.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   But what data did they suck up at that point?
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.320]   And for some people, they would not be okay with any data, I suppose.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.920]   This of course only happened from unencrypted Wi-Fi access points.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   So if you were encrypted...
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   That's encrypted.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   If you were encrypted, you're okay.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:58.800]   Unencrypted, you are one of many who received a total of $13 million of a payout.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.760]   Hey, if you have a Nest product, they already have your Wi-Fi bits anyway.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.040]   They have my Wi-Fi bits all over the place.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   So many products.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   The other one was age discrimination.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.440]   And I was surprised.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.760]   I don't know if I didn't remember this, but it's job applicants over the age of 40.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.880]   I thought it was like 50.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.280]   So I'm now of an age where I can be discriminated against, and that makes me sad.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280]   Stop.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   Damn you.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   Damn you too.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   Me too.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   Me too.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   It's hard.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   We're all over the hill.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.040]   I sit where you sit.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.600]   Nations.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.160]   Class actions to represent 200 people.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.120]   And let's see here.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   Google still denies and disputes that discrimination occurred.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:57.200]   However, they agreed to an $11 million settlement, which comes out to about $35,000 each.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.800]   I mean, I guess that's a good settlement for those people.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   Although--
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   No, it's--
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Although it's--
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.200]   Implementing some practices to rectify that would have been better.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   Would have been better.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.800]   Yeah, actually fixing the problem.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   Yes.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.400]   I'm not saying it absolves.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   Cool.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   And $35,000 is--
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   Actually, not that much.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.520]   That's what, like, it's like a month's day.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.520]   There are school teachers.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.920]   And it's a good payout for a teacher.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   That's really--
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.840]   There are teachers in Alabama who get paid more than that.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.240]   So that's how kind of lame it is.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:39.680]   I guess I just can't help but put it into the context of a class action suit where you
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.040]   get in on it and then you get your check in the mail and you open it up.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.120]   It's like $0.13.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.320]   So I was like, all right, $35,000.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.160]   It's better than the $0.13 check I've received for class action.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   OK, yeah.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   That's at least worth the--
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.880]   That's worth the postage, at least.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   And then--
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:06.800]   And then the last one involves minors using YouTube and violations of the Children's Online
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.360]   Privacy Protection Act.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.840]   I'm less aware about the specifics of this one.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.920]   There isn't actually a public disclosure of the figure, of the settlement.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   But yeah.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.960]   So yes, the reason you're unclear is because the FTC hasn't made it public and the committee
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   hasn't made it public.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.440]   So it's not your fault.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.440]   It's not your sleepless night.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.440]   Thank you.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:34.560]   So just the department's going to come in and either approve or tweak the settlement.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.560]   OK.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:42.480]   So I think that's the issue.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.400]   I'm interested in this mostly because I have a kid who's about to turn $0.13, although
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.480]   I'm interested also in the sense that I'm like, ah, my child who's about to turn $0.13,
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.200]   but still-- she's still a kid.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.400]   So that's just me.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.800]   Google runs into this quite a bit.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.320]   I see it in the education space with Chromebooks.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:11.120]   And it's typically, in my opinion, not Google's fault when you have kids under the age of 13
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.920]   with Chromebooks that were given by the school.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.120]   But then those Chromebooks are not properly managed by the school's IT department.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.040]   And the kids have carte blanche to surf and go wherever.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.360]   But yet it often comes back to Google, like, hey, what's going on here?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.080]   And they make the tools and they make everything available.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.600]   But you have to actively manage these things.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.800]   And I think this is one of the trickiest bits of legislation or laws that any of these
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.840]   tech companies have to deal with because the technology is so accessible.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   You can have a five-year-old kid who can walk up to an iPad or a fire tablet and just
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   start using it.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.160]   And well, wait a second.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.120]   Did they agree to all the proper terms of service and so on?
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.520]   There's just so much that is a challenge with copper.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   It's a great thing.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.200]   Trust me, I believe that.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.960]   But the technology is just so accessible for the kids.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:11.120]   Well, back a couple of months ago, there was a group that sued on behalf of kids with
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.200]   Amazon and Google and smart speakers collecting information and keeping them.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:24.840]   But the challenge there is that back in 2017, the FTC actually tried to explain how COPA
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.760]   would affect digital speakers.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.560]   And they were like, yeah, it's OK.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.120]   They said it will not take an enforcement action against an operator for not getting
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.280]   parental consent before collecting the audio file with a children's voice when it's fulfilling
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.320]   a search request as long as it's only held for a small amount of time.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.520]   But then they came back, this lawsuit rests on the idea that they keep it.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.120]   So I think there's also, it's not just difficult, like, is there a 13-year-old or younger trying
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.160]   to use my services, but it's also, what are they using it for?
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.680]   How can we separate their data so we can treat it differently?
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.800]   And it's a mess.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.600]   And then tracking all that's a nightmare.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.560]   Absolutely.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.760]   And what do you think about this Google patent titled, "Gameifying Voice Search Experience
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   for Children."
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.720]   So this is kind of related.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.480]   It involves turning search into a gamified experience for toddlers.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:34.040]   So they're working on ways to improve voice search for kids because when they are using,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400]   when kids, and toddlers might be a little young, but when kids, and I know I've seen
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:44.440]   it with my youngest, when she's using the Google Home, a lot of times her search query,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   maybe she stutters or gets nervous or maybe slows down her speech and stops talking for
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.040]   a second, trying to figure out how she wants to query it or whatever, the Google Home will
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.440]   react incorrectly to that.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:05.160]   And so Google is thinking, "Hey, we've got to come up with ways to make this more facilitating
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.880]   for younger children."
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.800]   So screening out inappropriate content when it knows that there is a younger child using
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.720]   the device, that sort of stuff.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   What do you think?
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:24.760]   I think less the gamification, but the ability to identify a child using the system and then
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.960]   reacting appropriately, such as screening, is something that Google is probably incredibly
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.240]   interested in doing.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   Totally.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.160]   Just because it's a vision for the smart home that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   I think we may talk about it in a little bit, but one of the examples that Rishi Chandra
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.360]   gave when he was talking about the smart home was, and I could be wrong, it could have been
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:52.560]   the writer of the piece who gave this example, but when you're listening to inappropriate
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.440]   music and your kid walks into the room, it turns off.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.240]   Which anybody, like my sister-in-law loves her gangster rap, and I could totally see
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.840]   her really appreciating a feature like that.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.880]   Or maybe your kid's listening to inappropriate music and when you walk into the room.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.360]   Oh boy, yes, they'll turn it in the other direction.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.520]   But it'd be useful for me when I was a kid.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:27.440]   Yeah, so the writer may have hit on the gamification angle as part of the patent, but it may be
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.720]   something else in there that's more interesting to Google, if that makes sense.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.920]   Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.720]   Kevin doesn't agree.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.400]   No, no, I agree with everything you said.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:47.600]   I just kind of wish that the local on-device natural language processing that Google showed
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.360]   off at Google I/O where they'll basically push down or push up what it's learned from
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.160]   the model up to the cloud and therefore make everybody's NLP experience better if they
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.640]   can do that with the kids as well.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.560]   Because that's not sending the actual data at that point of the speeches with the kids
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.960]   are saying it would actually just say, "Hey, this didn't seem accurate, we need to make
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   this better in the model."
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.800]   And that information, the metadata goes up, not the kid's actual conversation.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.240]   So I would rather see that than some kind of gamified Google voice search for kids.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.320]   I wouldn't mind you, this is just a patent.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.800]   So this isn't like...
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.480]   Although if anyone's seen the little YouTube video of the little toddler trying to get,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:40.720]   I think it's Madam A to play Baby Shark and tries so hard, it is really heartbreaking.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.920]   It is so frustrating.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.760]   Anytime you see a little kid try to use these things, you're just like, "Oh, little kid."
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.080]   Yeah, especially if it's... I've had many moments where I'm watching my kids.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   They love using our Google Home to play music.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.120]   They love putting on dance shows and everything.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.280]   And I'd say it works for them about 75% of the time.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.640]   The other 25% of the time, it totally should work.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.760]   I listen to their query, they've learned it by now, they know how to control Google Home,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.120]   but for whatever reason, time and time again, they repeat the command and then I come over
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.440]   and do it and it works for me.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.160]   So it's frustrating.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.600]   It's frustrating watching your kids do this.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.680]   Now at the same time, another thing that this article pointed out is this idea that as Google
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:34.720]   works on creating voice control for younger children, some people are worried that this
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:39.880]   in turn hooks kids too young on the technology, which I think is kind of ridiculous, but I'm
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.280]   curious to know what you think.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.840]   Because I feel like it's part of the world we live in at this point.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.680]   Well, voice is natural.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.280]   I don't know what the right engine is.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:57.960]   This is actually developmentally a lot better than if they're talking to Google rather than
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.480]   interacting with Google on a screen.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:09.960]   This is working out the kids voice is actually a beneficial thing for them.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.920]   Google, it was Amazon, Google may have this too, but a polite mode, they listen to parents
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   who are like, look, my kid is being a total jerk to these things and I would like that
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.080]   not to happen.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.240]   So they're even making efforts.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.000]   And if we don't call it gamification and we just call it like teacher or kids how to
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   talk to something like a respectful entity, maybe the ability to turn something like that
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   on helps.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.080]   I mean, because even as adults, not all adults, but some adults, when you're talking to a
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.880]   kid, you generally give them more slack, maybe wait a little longer when they're trying to
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.360]   come up with words and you speak differently to toddlers.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.000]   So yeah, I think this is way better.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.160]   If they started implementing like dark patterns to keep my kid hooked, I've got issues.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.240]   Yeah, I think the ship has sailed on this anyway.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.280]   I mean, there are kids that their first words are actually the wake words for these devices.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.600]   I don't want to say them because I don't say everybody's off, but you know, and I agree
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.880]   with what Karsten said.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   I mean, it is.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.720]   It's more intuitive, natural.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.880]   It's far better than interacting with a screen.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.280]   So yeah, yeah, I agree.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.360]   All right.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   So today we're doing something a little different.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.920]   It is time to take a break, but I'm not going to give you that break.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.880]   Leo is going to come back from his vacation really quick.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.560]   Sit in this chair and give you that break right now.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.560]   Thanks guys.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.240]   Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to mention our sponsor.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.000]   Maybe you noticed how white my teeth have been lately.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.040]   It's because I'm using these incredible crest 3D white strips.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.200]   You know, I love my coffee.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.440]   I love wine.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.640]   All that food and drink over the years takes a toll on you, how your teeth look.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.560]   If your teeth are looking a little yellow, that makes you look a little bit older.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.800]   That's why I love the crest 3D whitening kit.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.600]   It removes over 10 years of tough set-in stains from coffee, wine, and smoking to give you
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   noticeably whiter teeth, 100% guaranteed.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.320]   People will look at you and say, "What are you doing?
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   Did you lose weight?
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.600]   You looked younger.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.000]   What's going on?"
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.240]   You can tell them or you don't have to.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.400]   It's the crest 3D white strips.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.840]   By the way, this is the same treatment you can get at the dentist's office, but it's
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.200]   a lot less expensive, hundreds of dollars less than those expensive dental treatments.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.240]   For the same results, in fact, they're using the same active ingredient dentists use to
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.280]   whiten your teeth, hydrogen peroxide.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.920]   These soft, sticky little strips go right on your teeth.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.680]   You sit there, I watch a TV show.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.040]   By the time it's done, the strips are done, but then this is the extra part.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.040]   It uses this LED blue light to help target stains, and that makes the ingredients work
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.160]   faster and better than just white strips alone.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.240]   This is exactly the same LED light technology dentists use.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.040]   Crest white strips are amazing.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.160]   No gels, no trays.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.200]   You put them on in your own house.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.880]   No slip grips, so you can talk.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.520]   You can drink water during the treatment.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.680]   That's fine, but you'll love how you look when you take those strips off.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.280]   You won't believe it.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.600]   It's guaranteed to deliver 100% noticeably whiter teeth.

[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.560]   Maybe you weren't in this exact chair, but you were in another chair in this room.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   Back to your vacation.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.280]   We'll talk to you later.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:23.320]   What do you say we talk a little bit about IoT here?
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.600]   Google Nest Max.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   I don't know.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   Kevin and I don't know anything about IoT.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   I know.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   I realize I'm just like, I'm taking a big risk, but I thought we should just like change
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   things up a little bit.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   All right.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   Shake it up.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   Google Nest Max.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   Are you guys excited for this?
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.480]   Apparently it's going to be out September 9th, $229.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.880]   It's the device that has the 10-inch display on the camera for video chat.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.680]   Finally has a date and a price.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   What do you think?
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.880]   We were so not excited about this that we didn't even talk about it.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   Cool.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.320]   I'm happy I led with it in the IoT block.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.840]   But hey, we can share with us now.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.880]   We have larger screen devices already.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.280]   I have a 10-inch Lenovo Smart Display.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.440]   I do too.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.640]   We never use it to talk to each other.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   Oh.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.440]   Well, the smart display does have a camera.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   It does, right?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   It does.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   Does it have a manual shutter?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   I think it does.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   Yes, it does.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   Okay.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.480]   So yes, I love this device.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.800]   It sits on my desk.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   It's right in front of me.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.360]   It mostly shows me pictures and the weather.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:39.160]   It actually still shows it to me in Austin time because Google, I thought I'd reset it,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.600]   but apparently I haven't reset that one yet.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   Okay.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   Well, then how about this?
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:51.240]   Xi Chandra, the VP of product and GM at Google Nest, actually chatted with Forbes.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.600]   He says some interesting things about the smart home.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.720]   He actually says, "No one asked for smartness for the smart home."
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:05.480]   He loses the fact that Google is deviating away from smart home, moving more toward helpful
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   home.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.600]   Is this a difference with what is the saying?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.560]   It changed with no difference or whatever.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   What do you think?
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   Semantics.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   Semantics, yes.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.560]   Partially, partially.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.080]   At I/O, Google said the new assistant will be more helpful.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.200]   They touted helpful, helpful, helpful all throughout.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.520]   So I think it's a trying to rebrand a little bit and also to get people to stop talking
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.560]   about, "Well, smart devices collect my data," and so on and so forth.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:43.040]   Helpful means to me, "Well, if you give us some of your data, it will be more helpful."
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.240]   So hopefully it's trying to tamper down that is my thought.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   Instead of it being an all-knowing device, it's a device that can assist you, can actually
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.920]   provide value and help in your life.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.400]   And this is...
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   Semantics.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.960]   Total semantics.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.240]   This isn't actually different from...
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.640]   When Google bought Nest and Tony Fadel was in charge of this, he actually went in very early
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:17.880]   on... I remember a Wall Street Journal op-ed in late 2014 or early 2015, where he was like,
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.340]   "Look, the smart home concept is dumb.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.360]   We want the intuitively home.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.160]   We want a home that anticipates your needs and gets there."
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.760]   And you know what?
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   Bless their hearts.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.480]   They have been trying this forever.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.640]   We are not there yet.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.360]   The reason we're not there yet, or one of the big reasons is there are no standards.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   So until we see...
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:47.160]   In Google, actually, Rishi addresses that later in the interview, but they basically talk
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.760]   about it like they're streamlining what they're doing, which they are.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.080]   By getting rid of the Nest APIs, Google's bringing everything under one controllable
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   place, and they will still do integrations.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.880]   I do believe that.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.640]   But this is not news.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.080]   This is frustrating because we've known this is the problem.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.440]   We know why it's happening, and it's still happening because no one wants to have real
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   standards in interoperability.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.360]   I mean, Rishi points that out in the interview.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.960]   He says that he's hopeful that standardization will occur and actually compares it to web browsers
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.200]   back in the new web browsers.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.640]   So instead of being hopeful, Rishi, why don't you do something about it?
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   You're Google.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   No, that's true.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   Turns out...
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   That's like me.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   You have the potential the last way.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.800]   In my household saying to my daughter, "Man, I hope you get food on the table tonight.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.280]   That would be awesome."
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.120]   Yeah, it would.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.280]   Maybe I should do something about it.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   All right.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   It's a good idea.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   Sorry.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   That would be helpful.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   That would be a helpful home.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   Exactly.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   Even the spark.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Who knows?
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.440]   Both could exist that both are true.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   Kevin, you wrote about on this site called StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.080]   You wrote about the firewall.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.720]   Tell us about it.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.040]   So this is a really small but powerful device.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.360]   I mean, it's literally the size of a USB phone charger.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.680]   It's very small.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:24.120]   You connect it to your router at home and it just kind of hangs off there.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.840]   What it does is it's like a network monitoring tool on steroids.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.880]   And I say that because there are some good networking monitoring tools out there.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   Like Stacey has ERO in its subscription to kind of track what's going on with her network
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.240]   and her data.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.920]   But this actually takes it a whole step further.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:49.000]   It literally tracks for all of your devices all the way through to the final endpoint servers.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.800]   So you can see, for example, like my WISE cam.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.360]   I wanted to be sure I wasn't sending my videos to a server in China.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.120]   It tells you exactly where these videos are going when they get uploaded.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.400]   And I find out there on Amazon Web Services.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.760]   And I got the IP address and it tells me that it's actually using the June API.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.560]   So it's all legit.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:14.840]   So the idea here is that all of your devices, not just your phones, TVs, tablets, computers,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.160]   but everything is monitored and you can see exactly where the data is going.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:25.040]   So from an IoT standpoint, this is just spectacular in my opinion.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.720]   It has a ton of other features, it has a built-in VPN server, which is fantastic because there's
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.280]   no subscription fee.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.560]   The server is actually in your house and it's there if you want it.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:41.760]   And I tested that out and I wanted to make sure that I could stream video content from
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   away from home.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   And sometimes that's a challenge.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.520]   When you go outside of your home network area or you're in a country that maybe doesn't
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.160]   support Netflix, you're kind of at a luck.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.040]   But because the VPN servers in your house, Netflix doesn't know that I'm connecting through
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.840]   my home VPN.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.560]   So it serves up the content wherever I'm at, which is fantastic.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.600]   And again, no subscription fees.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.000]   Other features it has, it detects malware on your network and on your devices.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.040]   You can block porn sites, you can block social media, you can block gaming, and you can even
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.320]   do that for like a set amount of time for the entire family with the touch of a button.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.640]   Just block all social networking for an hour, boom, and done.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.360]   It's got a built-in ad blocker, again, whole home, not device by device.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.400]   Everything gets blocked on all devices when it comes to ads with this thing.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.200]   And shoot, there was one other feature that I thought was fantastic and now I'm drawing
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.000]   a blank.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.640]   But Stacey read my post, so she's going to remind me, right?
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.960]   I'm not because I was reading about the FTC or FTC Facebook settlement because I already
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   knew about firewall.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   Oh, no.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:58.680]   Yeah, so regardless, the device, I think the normal price for the lower version, lower
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.440]   version, by that I mean, it's really meant to, for home networks, like they can handle
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.800]   up to 100 megabits per second.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.520]   That device is 129.99 on sale for 109.99 right now.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:16.760]   I tested the blue firewall which goes up to, or supports up to one gigabit per second
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.960]   connections and that is only 199 now on sale for 179.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.680]   So really, I was very impressed.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.360]   I did have a problem and in fact, that's why I'm fuzzy right now.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.480]   With Google Wi-Fi network routers, the only way I can get it work and it's a known issue
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   with the firewall of folks, I had to basically disable the mesh network and just use a single
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.880]   access point with the firewall and obviously that's not great.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.920]   But the feature set was so outstanding that I tell you, I almost could live with one access
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   point.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.960]   So it's, I'm very impressed, very impressed.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.000]   If you want to know where your connected device data is going, this is fantastic.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.120]   Oh, it's really interesting.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.520]   So my question for Kevin after hearing this was, this is not the first time Kevin has
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.640]   had Google Wi-Fi problems.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:14.320]   Google Wi-Fi behaves badly with, I think it was, was it your ring doorbell or was something?
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.800]   The ring was an issue for a while.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.960]   Yes, that's correct.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.640]   And then something else that you had.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.440]   And I was like, Kevin, I think it might be time to get rid of the Google Wi-Fi and Kevin
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.440]   is...
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.440]   I mean, I could, absolutely I could.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.760]   I think the ring issue that I had to do with the 2.4 gigahertz requirement and mesh networking
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.080]   in general kind of bonds together, your 2.4 and your 5 gigahertz networks.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.400]   So that may or may not be specific to Google Wi-Fi.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.200]   I have had a couple problems.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.360]   In general, it's been pretty good.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:50.400]   I could swap it out, but it's like another router mesh network setup is going to cost
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.000]   me $200 or $300.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.840]   And this pretty much works fine.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.160]   And frankly, I don't pay you enough.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.560]   I didn't say that.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.040]   No, it's fine.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.720]   You know, I mean, ever since having not really worked full time for two years, I'm watching
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   my budget.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.400]   So it's a tough sell.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.400]   It's a tough sell.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   Wait, you guys are getting paid?
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   Secrets out.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.400]   Ta-da.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   Ta-da.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:23.480]   Yeah, the mesh factor can definitely mess things up.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:28.320]   The euro at home and just full disclosure, euro is a sponsor of the Twin Network.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:37.560]   But I have a particular smart plug for outside and it requires 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:43.160]   And because it's a mesh network on the inside, there was no way for me to get the smart plug
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.480]   to recognize the network the way it needed to.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:53.040]   It's like because of that mesh network kind of split between 2.4 and 5, there was no way
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   for me to lock it in.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.920]   So I had to do some really interesting things, you know, like pulling the device far enough
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.880]   a way that it would trick it into only connecting to one and not the other in order to get it
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.400]   to connect and just set it up.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.080]   And no one's it was set up, it was fine.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.600]   But it was just like getting that initial connection sometimes.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.160]   That whole 2.4 gigahertz and just about all these connected devices of weight, as annoyed
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.760]   the crap out of me, as Stacey knows, at CES, we always talk to all these vendors.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760]   Why are you doing that?
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   You're missing out with mesh networking and causing problems.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.000]   And I think it really comes down to cost, you know, the cost of the chips.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   You could, Jason or anyone else, if you have a 2.4 gigahertz specific device for your house,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.960]   some guest networks on routers will let you set the band or the channel.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.720]   So that's an option.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:49.080]   Even though it's like a distributed like mesh network throughout your home, the guest network,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.720]   you can lock that into a particular band on some of these devices.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.280]   I don't think the guest network, I don't think is truly a mesh network at that point,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   is it?
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:07.400]   Mine, my mesh network on Euro is a get or my guest network is a mesh network on Euro.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.880]   Others may do it differently, but it is still a mesh.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.520]   There are things like such a mesh.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.600]   And, you know, everyone's going to behave a little bit differently.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.720]   So your mileage may vary depending on who you have, because again, the mesh isn't, well,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   it is standardized, but no one's using the Wi-Fi lines as standard for it.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   So, right, right.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   Easy mesh.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   Easy mesh.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   Easy mesh.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   Easy mesh.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.440]   So the answer here is, well, try.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.200]   The answer basically is try a different mesh router, which is a terrible answer to
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   anyone.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   Absolutely.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   Absolutely.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:55.120]   Why don't we stay with things that you guys are writing?
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.720]   Chrome, we can kind of hop into a little Chrome news here.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.960]   Chrome OS76 Stables coming to Chromebooks next month.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.440]   Kevin, you wrote about this at aboutchromebooks.com.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.400]   What are some of the features that you're excited about?
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:18.640]   Well, the biggest feature is that I like anyway, is the virtual desktops.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.760]   And I don't know if other people use these on their Windows, Mac or Linux machines now,
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:31.240]   but Chrome OS is finally getting virtual desktops where you can have up to four desk places,
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.840]   workspaces, whatever, and a call them.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:38.720]   And that way you can group your different apps and tabs into separate sections.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.160]   You want one for social media, you want one for work, one for content consumption.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.440]   So again, it's been standard on a lot of desktop platforms in the past.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.160]   It's finally, I think it was coming in '73 and they get push, push, push.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.960]   It's coming in '76.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   It works pretty well.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.120]   I've been testing it.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:00.240]   They just figured out how to make a four finger swipe to swipe through your desktops, kind
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.160]   of like you use three fingers to swipe through open tabs.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.360]   So I'm like super psyched over that one right there.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:11.160]   So I don't know if you guys use or will you use virtual desks?
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.600]   Like Stacy's got a Mac, for example.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.800]   Yeah, I was like, no.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.440]   Hey, no.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.320]   I don't have a Chrome, well, so I don't have a Chromebook, but this is just Chrome.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.040]   I've tried to stop using Chrome as much.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.320]   Welcome, I'm curious.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.120]   Just because I like playing with other browsers.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.360]   So that's just me.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.960]   I've been using this a lot.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:46.160]   It works really well on mobile and it's got a few bugs on desktop, but it's, I don't
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.640]   know, I like it.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.840]   I have used Brave.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.680]   What else have I been doing?
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.880]   Brave browser is based on, is it Brave is Chromium?
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:04.800]   It's got one key combination that doesn't work.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:14.680]   It's got a bug on paste without paste as normal formatting, which is a very specific
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.440]   deal killer for me, but no one else.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.880]   But other than that, it's just like Chrome except much less ads and tracking cookies.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.960]   So it's very nice.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.960]   That's nice.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   I'm a true publisher.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.760]   Quantum, which is the Firefox one.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:41.440]   I was trying to remember what that was like Firefox, something.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:48.600]   So I will definitely use the virtual desktop because I use that all the time on my Mac computer
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.520]   in the other room.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.400]   I like having kind of the multiple spaces to be able to swipe between and stuff.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.680]   It's like having external monitors only there not external at that point, which is really,
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   really handy.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.240]   You just have to remember what's where and everything, but if you get it set up the
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.880]   right way for you, then that becomes pretty easy.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:12.160]   Android has a feature that I guess Chrome is kind of replicating back in Chrome 76 or
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.840]   Chrome OS 76.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.760]   Send to self so you can push web pages to your other devices.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.120]   So instead of from a phone to a computer, now it's you push a web page or something
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.760]   from Chromebook to any other device that has Chrome.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.240]   So it's kind of handy.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   Is it like Chromecast?
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.800]   Like I could push it to a TV if I've got a Chromecast in it or?
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.880]   I think it's more like a web page sending from one browser to another from one device
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   to another.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.320]   Chromecasting is pretty much built into Chrome OS.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.320]   Right.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   You know, yeah.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   Right.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.320]   So.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:53.280]   Well, there is another feature that if you're a publisher, you probably don't like coming to
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   Chrome 76 and that is that Google is making some changes to how incognito mode works.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.760]   Now if you have gone to publishing, you know, publisher sites, pay walled sites, let's
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:12.440]   say that offer a free kind of number of free articles every month.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.560]   And you know, suddenly you go to the article and says, well, you can't read anymore.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.400]   You've reached your five free article limit or whatever.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.720]   For a while, people had realized that by using incognito, they could continue to get
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.720]   those free articles.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.160]   It would always keep that number, that tabulated number set at zero viewed articles and you
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.320]   could continue going back.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.480]   Well, at some point, some of the new sites began to realize that they, though they could
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.600]   not identify, you know, they couldn't place cookies or anything to track how many free
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:46.760]   articles you've read in incognito, they could identify that there was a change in the file
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.320]   system API that was used to detect incognito mode.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:58.120]   Because Chrome was disabling the file system or Chrome is going to disable the file system
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.120]   API.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.080]   But prior to this, there was just some sort of recognition that the file system API was
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.240]   being used and the sites could see that.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:11.200]   And so they were then changing their behavior to say, well, if you're using Chrome and you're
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.160]   using incognito, then we aren't going to let you, you know, have any of these free articles.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:22.520]   So there's going to be a change that Google is going to roll into Chrome 76 that will
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.360]   prevent that trace from happening.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.080]   So I guess if you want to use incognito to read more articles, you can.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.720]   I do not imagine publishers will be very happy about that, but Google is doing that for you.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:40.360]   Yeah, this is kind of a security issue.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.280]   And actually, Steve talks about it on security now this week.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:51.160]   But people were kind of misusing this and it's not a good thing to leave open.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.120]   I think people believe incognito mode is like super safe, secure and private.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.600]   And it depends.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.800]   It's really the best answer.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:06.000]   I mean, if you never close the tab, you know, it's, I guess they call it a Fermil or Fermil
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   mode at Google.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   A femoral.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   A femoral.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   There we go.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.560]   That's why I didn't work with that team.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.320]   So, you know, once you close it, everything kind of disappears.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.080]   But it's not as private as people might think.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   It's not carte blanche.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.240]   Just do what you want and think you're not being tracked.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   Right.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   Yes.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.200]   There is definitely a limit wall that you run up to.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.800]   Private in some ways, not private in others.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.000]   I'm curious about this one.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.120]   You wrote about the Pixel Slate that's on sale right now.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.280]   If you go to Play Store, you get a hundred bucks off and you get a keyboard along with
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   it.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   You do.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.960]   You get your choice of keyboard and this deal started on the 21st of July and ends, I believe,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   the 27th.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.440]   So end of this week.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:59.200]   There'll be a couple of days after this show, you know, goes out across to everybody that
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   you can do this.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:05.800]   So you get a hundred bucks off any model, even the $1600 model, which I wouldn't recommend
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   to anybody.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   It's just overkill.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   Totally.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   I mean, honestly.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:19.320]   It's, I mean, I want a Core i7 Chromebook, but I don't want one with the mobile type processor
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   because it just doesn't really buy you that much.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:25.520]   But yeah, so you can get the Core M3 model or the Core i5 model.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.440]   That's the one I bought instead of $999.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.640]   Mine would cost $899 and then I would get a free either Google Pixel Slate keyboard or
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.920]   the Bridge Type G keyboard, which is actually quite good.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.240]   You know, see of your choice.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.160]   You know, I see a lot of people kind of scoffing at this.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.720]   Like there's a conversation on Reddit and like, yeah, make it $200 and I'll take it or the
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.280]   companies already said they're getting out of tablets.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.320]   So why would you bother?
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.400]   I think that's kind of harsh because it doesn't mean they're not going to support these things.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.000]   It's clearly, as we've already said, they're continuing to improve the tablet experience
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.840]   in Chrome OS for all Chrome OS devices, including the Pixel Slate.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.720]   So you know, if the device is not for everybody, I'm not saying everybody should jump on this
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.720]   deal.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.680]   But you know, if you're split between say 50% media consumption or tablet mode versus
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:24.320]   50% laptop mode, it's possibly worth considering if you are a pure Chromebook user.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.320]   No, this is probably not the best deal in the world for you.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.040]   I think that's the right advice right there.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   But I am now using my Pixelbook from the year prior.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:42.240]   I had been using the Slate up until the news actually that you were just talking about
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:48.400]   where Google kind of, I can't remember if they officially announced or what the wording
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.880]   was around that, but basically them getting out of the tablet business.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:57.520]   But at that point, it was kind of my indication that, okay, I can go back to the thing that
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.800]   actually works better for me, which is the laptop environment.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.200]   I had, I really ended up in my, however long I was using this late since it launched up
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.880]   until like maybe a month ago, I had never taken it out in tablet mode and had any sort
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.760]   of use for it in that particular mode.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.320]   So I think you're absolutely right.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.880]   If you, if you envision wanting to use it in a tablet sort of way, maybe media consumption
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.960]   or something along those lines, it makes a whole lot more sense.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   But if you just want a Chromebook, just because it's the latest one that Google put out doesn't
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.000]   mean you have to get that one, the Pixelbook is fantastic.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.600]   And I have to imagine they're going to update the Pixelbook this year at some point.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.760]   I believe they are.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.960]   And something hit the FCC about three hours ago from Quanta.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.400]   I know it's not on the list, but I literally just wrote it up before the show.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:57.920]   9 to 5 Google actually found this in the FCC filings.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.760]   Quanta has gotten the okay to, I guess it's a change in, I forget what they call it, it's
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.240]   a change in certification or something.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.880]   Basically they're going to use a new Wi-Fi chip from Intel.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:15.160]   The Intel wireless 9265 in some device, that device happens to have a device ID that sounds
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.040]   very much like the Pixelbook and Pixel Slate.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.800]   So it chances are it is the likely Pixelbook successor and we're pretty much set on Believen
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.760]   as to be the Atlas Chromebook, which has been in the works for a year and a half throughout
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.840]   all the code commits in Chromium.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:39.560]   So I think October is looking good for whatever Atlas is called, Pixelbook 2, Pixelbook 2019.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.960]   Jason's Pixelbook, I don't know what they're going to call it.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   Yeah, totally.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960]   I think he nailed it.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.360]   I think that's what it should be.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.160]   Awesome, well I will look forward to that because I love my Pixelbook.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.000]   It really is a great laptop, great computer.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.760]   I feel just as productive with this as any machine that I have.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.800]   The slate was fine, like operationally the slate was the same.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.880]   I mean Chrome OS is Chrome OS, right?
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.160]   So it was the same.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.200]   The keyboard was maybe a little less, you know, I liked it less than I liked the Pixelbook
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.840]   keyboard, but definitely kind of the extension.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.600]   I ended up with the Pixel slate keyboard, the kind of like flexible one as opposed to
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   the bridge one.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.560]   And I liked it for some reason.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.600]   Yeah, it has a big footprint because of the way it's designed.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.040]   I mean, mine is sitting right here next to me and it's still my daily driver.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.000]   I do use it in just like pure tablet mode to watch content when I'm lounging around the
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   house.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.800]   I've actually found it useful.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:48.400]   I take it to campus, you know, two, three times a week and do my CS coding on it in Java.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.680]   And then when we have study groups, it's so much easier to just like take it out and
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.120]   just pass it around.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.640]   People look at code as we're going over things because it's just a tablet at that point.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.080]   But that's a really specialized use case.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.600]   And again, most people don't need that.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.160]   They'd be better off with a pure, a pure Chromebook.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160]   Yeah, agreed.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160]   Cool.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.360]   We got some late breaking news in there as well.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.160]   Also Google has announced in, well, they announced last May that be looking closely
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.120]   at Chrome extensions to be sure that they're playing nice with personal data.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.400]   Well, this week Google announced two new Chrome Web Store policies to be enforced sometime
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.480]   later this year.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:38.560]   They switched from developers being encouraged to abide, to required by policy that requests
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.360]   access to the least amount of data.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.440]   I don't know how you justify what the least is, but there you go.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.720]   They are now required to do that.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.160]   Also extensions dealing with personal communications and user provided content must post privacy
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.720]   policies.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.560]   So this is a good thing.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:03.680]   I think it was just last week where some browser extensions gathered data from like four million
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.480]   users.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   Right.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   You know, it's, it's, that's not good.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.720]   So, yep.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.040]   That's not good.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.680]   That's not good.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.200]   Bad, bad extension.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.720]   We don't like that.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.640]   We like good.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.280]   We like rewards of up to $150,000.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.640]   If you happen to be a Chrome OS bounty hunter, you can make up to $150,000 if you demonstrate
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.080]   an attack that compromises Chromebook or Chrome box in the restricted guest mode.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.280]   So if you're looking for a big payday and you got some time on your hands, you know,
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   no big deal.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.680]   Evan, this is how you could fund your new mesh network purchase.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:48.080]   I was just thinking, I mean, heck yeah, I, I could remove all the ads from my site.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.280]   I could get new mesh network in gear.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   Yep.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.520]   It's one of those all it takes.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.080]   It's like, it's like winning the lottery.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.240]   Who solved your problem?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   You can't play.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.880]   You can't wait if you don't play.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   That's right.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880]   That's how it goes.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.120]   And then finally, I love that we have this Chromebook.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.720]   This is a nice solid Chromebook here.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:14.200]   Kevin, you wrote about the Dell, Dell's upcoming Chromebook with integrated LTE.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   What's that all about?
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.080]   So we don't see too many Chromebooks with integrated LTE anymore.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:26.840]   The last one, I think, was the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 that came out about a year ago.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.960]   Obviously, the second Pixelbook had LTE.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   Was it the first one?
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   I forget which.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   It's not Pixelbook.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   It's the Chromebook Pixel.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.400]   Yeah, the first one had it, right?
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.800]   Jeff, really, this is a feature Jeff is like, been hankering after.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.440]   I haven't seen, based on the Wi-Fi chip on the Atlas, I don't think we're going to see
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.920]   LTE in there.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.200]   But it sure looks like, well, I'm pretty much 100% feeling positive about this.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.440]   Dell has got two Chromebooks in the work.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.720]   One is called code name, Sarian.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.880]   The other is called Arcata.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   And there's been some testing being done on the Verizon wireless network for integrated
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.920]   LTE on Sarian.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.080]   So I captured this right on the Google Chromium bug reports.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.280]   So it's legit.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:21.800]   It sure looks to me like at least one of the two from Dell will indeed have LTE.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.960]   Dell hasn't announced these, of course.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.320]   One of these may be detachable based on Chrome commits.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.040]   One appears to be a traditional two-in-one.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.960]   The reason I say Dell is the likely brand is because some people with Dell email addresses
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.120]   have actually responded in the code commits to approve the code changes.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.320]   So it's, again, pretty likely that that's the case.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.320]   So don't know when.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.000]   Hopefully by the end of the year, we'll see two new options and at least one of them with
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.880]   LTE, which you're right, Stacey.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.760]   Jeff and many other people want LTE in their Chromebooks.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.760]   That's a bummer.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.760]   We don't see more of them.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.080]   That was a really cool feature.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:04.920]   And I mean, you know, these companies should know that if they make one, Jeff will buy
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920]   it.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920]   So yeah.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   Yes.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   Yes.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   Maybe no one else will.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   Yes, Jeff.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   Just trust.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   Exactly.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   I hear that's a highly lucrative market.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Yes.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.320]   So we'll just got to take the reins.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.840]   A lot of people don't see the benefit.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.080]   At least I've gotten comments from my readers on the LTE integration.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.240]   And they're like, I don't see the benefit.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.520]   I've got a phone that can be at a hotspot and I've got them.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   Sure.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520]   So what do I need this for?
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.520]   And I get that.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   I understand that.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:36.080]   But using your phone as a hotspot eats through battery very fast.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.480]   And it's like, what do you need at the end of the day?
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.520]   You need your phone to have a charge, you know, maybe not your Chromebook.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.440]   So I tend to not use my phone as a hotspot.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.000]   Integrated LTE would be nice.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Agreed.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Agreed.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   All right.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.320]   And when we come back, we'll talk about a few other things going on.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.760]   Maybe a little of the antitrust stuff, the Department of Justice, Facebook has some interesting
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.360]   stuff going on, the change law.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.520]   We've got a few things to still wrap up.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.840]   But before we get there, I want to welcome our old friend Leo LaPorte back to the show.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   Leo, pull up a chair over in the corner over there and tell me something.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.720]   If you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt real quick just to mention a new advertiser
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.360]   that I think has a great product.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.960]   And I know a lot of you will want, they're called H-refs.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.760]   Now it's a little confusing because the A is silent in H-refs.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.640]   It's spelled and anybody knows HTML will recognize the pun here.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.640]   A-H-R-E-F-S.com.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.160]   You know, it's a problem.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.240]   Anybody who's got a website, whether you're a big business, a small business, maybe you're
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.920]   a freelancer getting traffic to your website is always tough.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.640]   It's not always clear what you need to do.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.440]   And if you ask Google this, it would just make better content.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.880]   No, no, no.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.320]   There's also a lot of SEO snake oil.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.800]   People who are selling you expensive services that really frankly don't do anything.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.640]   I love H-refs.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.920]   It's an all-in-one set of tools for search engine optimization.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.320]   Use you the tools you need to help you rank on Google and it really works.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.440]   For instance, H-refs has competitive analysis.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.760]   Are there sites that are showing up better than your site when they search for your category?
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.680]   Those competitors are beating you out.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.480]   How are they doing it?
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.840]   H-refs will show you how your competitors are getting traffic from Google, what they're
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   doing.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.480]   You'll see the pages and the content that sends your competitors the most traffic.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.360]   You also find out the exact keywords your competitors rank for and which backlinks are
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   helping them rank.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.120]   And from there, you can replicate their strategies or better yet improve on their strategies
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.240]   and improve on your ranking.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.960]   If you're not getting significant search traffic, H-refs tools will help you find topics worth
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.320]   creating pages on or content on.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.520]   Topics will drive traffic for you.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.920]   You can easily see in fact what kind of search volume you're going to get from that particular
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.520]   new page or content.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.240]   You can gauge the traffic potential.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.920]   They have this keywords explorer tool that'll let you try ideas and see what kind of results
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.080]   you're going to get.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.880]   It really helps you direct your efforts into the most effective way to build traffic to
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880]   your website.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.840]   And after all, building traffic, your website means building business for you.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.680]   If you're getting search traffic already, you might want to know things like the top
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.880]   pages report that helps you break down which of your pages are bringing in the most traffic
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.040]   which aren't.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:29.280]   It really is helpful to know all this information is power.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.400]   And I think this is so good and it's so affordable.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.280]   In fact, they offer a lot of free information.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.120]   If you check out the H-refs blog or go to their YouTube channel, you get step by step
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.160]   tutorials and I love the tools.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.120]   Seven dollars for seven days.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.440]   That is a great trial.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.120]   Seven day trial, just seven dollars.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   Here's how you get it.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.560]   Go to at hrefs.com.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.720]   A-H-R-E-F-S.com.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   The A is silence.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.040]   Play on H-refs.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.680]   A-H-R-E-F-S.com.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.640]   The A is silence.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.320]   Seven dollars for seven days.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.120]   I think you're going to find these tools incredibly valuable.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.760]   We thank H-refs so much for supporting this week in Google.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.800]   I thank you for supporting us by going to H-refs.com.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.680]   Now back to the show.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.240]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240]   I catch the ball.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.800]   You go back to your vacation.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.240]   I've got this.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.640]   Settle down.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.560]   So, a few interesting things of note.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.880]   Tony Rome at the Washington Post had a scoop earlier this week that the FTC was going to
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.840]   issue a $5 billion fine to Facebook for privacy violations that were related to the Cambridge
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.800]   Adelitica kerfuffle.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.880]   It's two times today that I've been able to say that word from last year.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.240]   And the FTC molds stronger penalties, ultimately deciding to go with $5 billion as the fine
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240]   officially today.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.040]   The FTC announced this.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.440]   The largest fine in US history for privacy violations.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.760]   Although many people are thinking it didn't go far enough.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.080]   How much did their stock go up that day?
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.200]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.200]   So this was a couple of...
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200]   Six.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200]   A couple of...
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.240]   Six, in fact, six billion their stock went up.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.640]   A couple of days ago when it was rumored to be happening.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   Who was rumored to be happening?
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   Yes.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   And then what is the change today now that the FTC...
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   That's a good question.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.880]   Now that the FTC has officially announced it.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   Let's see here.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   What's there?
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880]   What's there?
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.320]   It's still going up.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:33.320]   I mean, yeah, it's up 1.4% today.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.200]   So I mean, Facebook's doing it.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.040]   Not too shabby.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.840]   I mean, there's other components of this.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.120]   It grants federal regulators 20 years of access to Facebook's business decisions.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.720]   Facebook basically has to create some sort of an independent committee in its board of
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.200]   directors to monitor and oversee privacy and then report quarterly to FTC on compliance
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.600]   for the next 20 years.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.480]   Facebook was not required to admit guilt.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.960]   Facebook is absolved of anything prior to like 2018.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:19.120]   So I mean, many people just kind of arguing that $5 billion is a bargain for the fact
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.480]   that Facebook got away with so much and doesn't have to change any of their ad practices going
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480]   forward.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   What do you guys think?
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.480]   This is...
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.160]   The orders that came through with this are pretty lame.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:40.040]   I mean, they're like, "Hey, Facebook, encrypt user passwords and scan to detect if any of
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.840]   those user passwords are in plain text.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:48.920]   Like everyone should be doing this and don't use or don't grab email passwords from other
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   services."
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920]   That's not the issue.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.280]   The issue is things like tracking pixels and back...
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.200]   Not backhanded.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:03.320]   Agreements between companies to share data that consumers may not be aware of.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.200]   Facebook is prohibited from using telephone numbers obtained to enable a security feature
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.920]   for advertising, which is like the bare minimum.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.360]   I don't know if you guys all remember, but they had done this thing where they were like,
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.800]   "Hey, give us your phone number for two factor."
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.440]   And then suddenly people were like, "Hey, they seem to be using my phone number for other
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.520]   stuff."
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.240]   They also said that they were going to take action against Cambridge Analytica, take legal
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.000]   action against the FTC announced.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.400]   They were going to take legal action against Cambridge Analytica.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.920]   But overall, this is pretty lame.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:45.400]   Oh, and there's a thing about facial recognition saying that Facebook must provide clear and
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:51.000]   conspicuous notice of all its use of facial recognition technology and obtain affirmative
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.960]   express user consent prior to any use that materially exceeds its prior disclosures.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.440]   So basically if it wants to do new stuff with your old photos, it has to get more consent
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.360]   from you on that.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.480]   And going forward, it has to ask.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:14.040]   Again, these are basic.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.600]   This is not new ground.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.400]   But the FTC feels uncomfortable going too far because there's no actual legal, there's
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.960]   no congressional rules.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.640]   And this is an area where we do actually need Congress to step up and come up with some
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.920]   sort of privacy regulations because the FTC is right.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.840]   It cannot go forward and make new laws.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.640]   It can only regulate the existing laws on the books.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.000]   And Facebook could come back.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.840]   It didn't in this case.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.080]   But it could have come back and said, hey, you know what, we don't agree with the FTC.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.120]   And then this could have went into court.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.080]   Even the basic recommendations that Facebook had agreed to might have been lost.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.480]   Yeah, I kind of an agreement.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:05.160]   I mean, everybody, you can debate if $5 billion is enough or not enough, et cetera.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.120]   To me, that's not the issue.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.080]   It's what does the company have to do going forward?
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   Not too much different.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.760]   I mean, you have to be a little more oversight and so on.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:19.480]   But I think it's a missed opportunity.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   And I wonder--
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:25.720]   Well, but again, I would say it's a wake-up call to say, hey, we don't have our regulatory
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.920]   agencies, don't have the tools they need to actually go after these problems that we're
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.080]   seeing with the world that we have in front of us with technology.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   Yeah, no, I don't disagree.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   It's a shame.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.000]   I mean, it's not like Facebook is a new company or any of these social networks are brand
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   new.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.800]   I mean, heck, not that they're involved with this, but I think I joined Twitter in 2006
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.800]   a little 13 years ago.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.240]   That's when you started having all this social networking really taking off.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.480]   And if you didn't see this coming, it's like, come on, guys, what are you doing?
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.640]   But one question I have.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.040]   Where's the $5 billion go?
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:11.280]   Because it was individual citizens whose privacy was abused basically, and yet we're
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   not getting the money, are we?
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   No.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.080]   No, absolutely not.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.840]   Yeah, that's a really good question.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:25.400]   And it'll be interesting to see what you're talking about at congressional oversight,
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.880]   like also in the news today, Attorney General, William Barr announced, I don't know if this
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.960]   was today or yesterday, but the Justice Department is opening a big antitrust review of all the
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.320]   big tech companies Facebook included as yesterday.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:46.440]   Facebook included, of course, but also Google, Amazon, Apple, to really take a look and examine
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.920]   the online platforms, their practices and search social media retail.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.960]   So that feels way more.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:02.360]   So that feels way more political than it does a legit effort to implement real privacy
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.600]   regulations.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.000]   That feels like a Trump said to call it Barnes, like, I'm pissed at these companies, fix it,
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.440]   make their lives miserable, add a tariff.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.880]   Well, yeah, in fact, didn't even tweet about this.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:20.480]   Many people are talking about these companies getting too big, may ask Barr to look into
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.480]   it.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.720]   What do you know, Barr's looking into it?
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720]   How about that?
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.600]   But the Justice Department will be working alongside the FTC.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.720]   The FTC had already created a task force to monitor tech competition last February.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.800]   Now they're going to be working together to explore these issues.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:44.440]   I think they already have to some degree, but yeah, so I don't know if that will influence
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.200]   what we're talking about as well with Facebook somewhere down the line.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:54.120]   The FTC issued a really excellent report all the way back in 2015 about the dangers to
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.520]   people's privacy.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.240]   It had the same things that we've talked about in terms of social networking, in terms of
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.040]   like metadata collection, in terms of location data collection.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.520]   It had all of this.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.400]   And the FTC's ultimate conclusion was this report.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.520]   It's like, this is a big problem.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.600]   As an agency, we don't have the legal grounding to protect consumers.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.520]   Congress, please write a law.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.680]   Four years later, we are still waiting for that law.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.240]   This was a report that was started in 2013.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.160]   It took them a year and a half to make this report.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:38.120]   It drives me absolutely bonkers because we look at this like this is something, like
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:44.080]   this is something they can actually solve and they can't and we keep ignoring the fact
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.720]   that we actually need to do something from a legislative perspective.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:53.240]   And given how slow we are here and the fact that we have nothing credible on the table,
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.520]   we're still three or four years out.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.000]   This fine, if anything, shows, you're like, "Oh, it's a billion dollars."
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.080]   But basically it shows this is like the literal limit of what the FTC can do.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   And it's pretty lame.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.240]   It's a good way to put it.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.040]   I think you're spot on.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.600]   I'm going to agree.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.720]   Bar also, by the way, yesterday said that encryption should include back doors for law
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.600]   enforcement to protect us.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.120]   So yeah, we've heard that one before too.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:28.480]   So who knows where that's going to lead.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.800]   And he's considered legislation to force tech companies to do this.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.280]   I'm not surprised.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.680]   Not surprised at all.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.720]   Am I missing anything before we jump into the changelog?
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.400]   Anything that we've skipped over that you guys definitely wanted to talk about?
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.760]   So figure we can do the changelog, do some tips and picks and stuff.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   I thought that the German courts deciding that Deutsche Telkom for the owner, well,
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.840]   it's not the owner team help anymore.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:04.520]   But saying that they couldn't use stream on in zero rating was kind of a useful thing.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:11.800]   It's not in the US, but I was like, go Germany for enforcing net neutrality, even if it's
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.200]   benefiting consumers because it's the principle that we need to implement.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.200]   Okay, that's it.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   I missed that one.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:27.320]   Actually related to that, I think I just read today, and I'll see if I can take up a
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:34.520]   link real quick, but in India, is it Netflix that is coming out with a $2 service or $3?
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   Exactly.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.680]   It's a mobile only service.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.120]   So yeah, that I would like that.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   You're not an Indian.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.120]   Although I already have Netflix for everything.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.200]   So DVD quality.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.440]   It's 48, yeah, it's 480p.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   Yep.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.680]   Okay, but still 288 a month when you did it.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.280]   But it's 199 rupees.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.440]   It's ridiculous, right?
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   You don't need like 1080p on your phone.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   No, totally.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.240]   Well, I mean, I guess it depends on your phone.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240]   You will with that Pixel 3a.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.960]   Yeah, you'll be missing it on the Pixel 3a.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.920]   But even then, if you're only paying $3 a month, who cares?
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:26.360]   Telephone providers will only give you 480.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.200]   780 or 480.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.080]   720, that's it.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080]   So yeah.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   480, 490.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   That's okay.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.680]   Somewhere around there.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.800]   That's pretty, that's a bargain right there.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.800]   As far as I'm concerned.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.200]   Honey, when that bug bounty, I'm going to move to India.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.200]   There you go.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.200]   Money's going to go far.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.200]   Oh, we'll never record again, Kevin.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.760]   It'll be way too early or too late.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.040]   That is true.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.200]   And it's time.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.920]   Why don't we jump into the Google change log.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.920]   The Google change log.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:10.400]   And we've got a few bits and pieces in here.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.080]   Google Photos updated for Android or is updating rather.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.400]   I don't know that I've seen the update yet.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.480]   To bring live video preview into the main photos tab.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.560]   So if you're scrolling through, there happens to be a video in there.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.040]   Instead of just showing you a video with a little indicator that it, or like a thumbnail
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:32.160]   with a little indicator that it is a video, that video is going to start playing.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   No audio.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:36.480]   So the little thumbnails will start playing one at a time.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.240]   So if you've got a page filled with a bunch of videos, it's not going to like have all
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   of them playing.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.640]   That would be kind of chaotic.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.520]   It'll play the oldest one and then move to the next one.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.120]   It'll play in full if you hover there long enough and don't want to hear the audio.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.080]   There you go.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.560]   I find myself like when I'm scrolling through social media and there's a video there, I
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.800]   do it all the time now.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   I don't even think about it.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.280]   I end up watching and reading the subtitles instead of actually listening.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.560]   It's a feature I never thought I would be happy to use and yet I do it all the time.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560]   Me too.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.600]   It's very useful.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.080]   People announced a ban to root certificates that are owned by dark matter.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.720]   This after Mozilla actually banned them two weeks ago, dark matter is reported to be
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.440]   involved with surveillance operations affecting human rights activists, journalists and foreign
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.720]   governments.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.480]   So Google is cracking down on the dark matter.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.080]   That's a good thing.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   Also I like this.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.440]   I think this will be really cool.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:42.360]   Google's updating fast pair functionality in Android later this year to allow for better
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.040]   battery life information, better battery life data for wireless earphones.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:54.720]   They're basically going to rope this into Android Q, the UI and on the settings or whatever.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:03.160]   So it's going to allow you to see if you're using a fast pair enabled earphone brand or
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   model.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:09.240]   It's going to allow you to see the remaining battery on each independent earphone, the remaining
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:15.360]   battery inside of the charger, whether the charger is open or closed, be able to unpair,
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.400]   which I think you can still do that.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.960]   Also to ring them and track them and find in what does it find my device.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.280]   And it may not just be for Android because there are bits and pieces of code and some
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.480]   screenshots on Reddit showing it on Chromebooks as well.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   Oh, nice.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.000]   That would make a lot of sense.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.640]   That would be really cool.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.640]   I like that.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.240]   I think that's an awesome feature.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.120]   This is neat and very useful.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.600]   Google research team built something called Smiley.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:53.000]   It's a tool that acts as reverse image search for aiding in cancer diagnosis.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.680]   Smiley stands for similar medical images like yours.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.880]   And essentially what it's designed to do, it's a tool that the user would drop in a sample
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.760]   image from a patient.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.800]   And Google's machine learning algorithms would then compare it to the cancer genome
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.640]   atlas to compare regions.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:17.520]   And it gives doctors of whoever happens to be using this tools for closer specification,
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.600]   for determining what results the system should return.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.200]   It's basically all about identifying what exactly they're looking at compared to other
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.520]   samples in the cancer genome atlas.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.240]   It's an experiment for now.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.240]   Doctors who used it said they preferred it over their traditional interfaces.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:43.160]   That sounds like a really useful technology for something like this.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.720]   And I just have to imagine we're going to see more and more of this sort of thing in
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.720]   medicine.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.720]   That is really cool.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.360]   And then finally, Google will mark apps in the Play Store with a new label when an app
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.040]   is not meant to target younger age groups.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.080]   It will be not designed for children, will be the call out.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:08.240]   It'll appear just under the install button and show like a little yellow triangle to
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240]   get your attention.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.200]   It will always be present there.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.400]   Developers are required to specify target age range for their apps.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.160]   They have a deadline of September 1st to make that happen.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.440]   But that'll make it easier when you're in the Play Store to know whether this is something
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.720]   that might not be appropriate for younger children.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.720]   Scooter X and Chat says it's already there.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.440]   So it won't be fun or interesting or helpful.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:39.320]   It's to actually, I guess they can't do this without creating keeping data, but giving
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.600]   parents the ability to create an account for their kids.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.520]   And I know there's family is a family link, family.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   Family link.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.760]   So and then being able to put that over an entire device that you could actually lock
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.800]   to even just Google services would be interesting.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:04.640]   So like then the YouTube like it's tied to the hardware, not necessarily to the hardware,
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.360]   but to the whole OS for the phone.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.400]   So like it's like an Android for under 13 set, right?
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.200]   And that way the pair, it would make it easier for parents trying to manage stuff, but things
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.880]   like safe search could be by default, figuring out the app store would only show these, you
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   know, appropriate apps.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   It's your man.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.560]   So then you would be kids.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.800]   Yeah, they would be so pissed.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.120]   But so I don't know.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.560]   I mean, like you could even, I mean, when do you do this right now?
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.920]   When you upload a YouTube video, can you specify age range or explicit content?
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:43.920]   I can't remember.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.400]   It's been forever since I've paid attention.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.160]   I haven't uploaded a video to YouTube in a long time.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:54.800]   I mean, yes, people will still game the system, but you could verify.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.800]   Things.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.800]   And maybe that makes it like maybe by adding just a few extra constructs when you upload
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:07.280]   content, you could still make it relatively easy for stuff to be vetted.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280]   I don't know.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.840]   Maybe I'm hopelessly naive.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.880]   No, it's a good idea.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.400]   And I don't know if you can do that on Android.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.560]   I know on the Chromebook side, you can kind of do that and like limit access to the Play
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   Store or a subset of apps or et cetera.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.120]   But I don't know about Chrome OS.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.120]   I'm sorry about Android.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:36.520]   ScooterX coming to the rescue again says age restricted videos are not visible to users
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.640]   who are logged out are under 18 years of age or have restricted mode enabled.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.640]   Nice.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.200]   All those things and gives a link in the chat room.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.160]   But how do you know if something's age restricted?
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   Thank you, ScooterX.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.160]   Right.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160]   Well, that you have multiple human beings.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.360]   I have to imagine, yeah, that the person uploading the video adds the flag.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.480]   But of course, not everybody's going to add that flag if they, especially if they have
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.280]   ill intentions.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:08.520]   So how is that tracked and enforced?
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.520]   I don't know.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.760]   Yeah, this isn't going to, yeah.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:19.720]   Anyway, because I just think of things like on the Apple with iTunes or with podcasts, for
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.880]   example, we keep our podcast clean because we don't want to get flagged.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.720]   I think you guys probably do the same thing as explicit because then that won't show off
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.600]   into this another world.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   I would just.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   Oh, no.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   Maybe you won't.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.600]   Oh, you will.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   Okay.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:44.120]   It's just the worst when you have that build up and then you don't end up sneezing.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.520]   I feel cheated when that happens.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   Bless you.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   Bless you again.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.520]   One time you guys.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   Bless you, Stacy.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:57.160]   The point is Google is not as active as Apple.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.840]   You're allergic to the story.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.840]   I get it.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.840]   I understand.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:04.280]   Well, then, why don't we move into pics and Stacy?
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.840]   I won't, I won't, I won't like to first.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.600]   We'll give you time to recover.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.600]   Kevin.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   Yes.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.400]   Kevin, what's your stuff?
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   So it's rather timely and historical, I think.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.800]   There's a YouTube channel of a guy.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.320]   I think the channel is curious.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.480]   My, I forget it.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   I forget.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.840]   But I've got a link in the show notes.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.600]   And what this guy does is he repairs.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:39.480]   He buys, finds and repairs computer hardware from the 70s and all kinds of old, old stuff.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:45.280]   And he stumbled onto a guy who bought the actual Apollo guidance computer for the moon
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   landing.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   No way.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.280]   Yes, he did.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.880]   He restored it.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.120]   And this is a lengthy video and he can be boring it sometimes.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:32:00.880]   But what he's done is he has literally replicated the lunar landing or an attempt at it.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:06.840]   And you can see how difficult it is to program this thing because it's all done by numbers.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:11.760]   Like he would say, okay, program 65, we're going to run that for 45 seconds.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:17.520]   And he would literally type 65, enter, 45, enter and then wait and the program would
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.720]   kick in.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:24.920]   What amazes me not that he restored it and can replicate the landing.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.960]   It's just amazing to me that this is what was used to land on the moon 50 years ago.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:30.960]   Like he's entering.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.600]   Yeah, that's seven key is stuck.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:40.640]   He's entering whatever the ignition now and then he has to put something else in and that
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.520]   kicks off the sequence for something else to happen.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.520]   That's the interface.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.640]   It's all numbers.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.520]   And you know, 50 years ago, this was like crazy high tech right here.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.880]   And it, you know, it's it's a level technology.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880]   Yes.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:56.880]   And it's only crazy now.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:01.480]   I think about it because science people things have changed so much since then.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.920]   And this is this was the future.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.840]   Yeah, it's the whole series.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:12.720]   I think this is like at this is like part 21 of restoring the Apollo computers, but he
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:18.400]   debuted this on the day that the people landed on the moon and 50 years later.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.680]   And it was just amazing to see and how challenging it was to use.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.200]   I mean, these guys were able to quote unquote land on the moon with this.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.640]   But even so, their horizontal speed was like 21 feet per second.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.760]   So they would have tipped the lunar lander over.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.760]   So just amazing that we could do that with this.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.760]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.320]   That was really something that's really cool.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.440]   With the watch, worth the watch.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.520]   Worth more views than it has.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.080]   It's something like 34,000 views.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.400]   Kind of crazy.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:52.040]   People don't seem to care about computers from the 60s and 70s like I do.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.800]   I mean, I'm going to watch the hell out of this.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.440]   Carson's going to have it on repeat in our office.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.920]   I'm going to come in.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.040]   Is this a thing for you, Carson?
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.680]   I am fascinated with the computer technology of Apollo 11.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:13.560]   I have a little Lego figure of Margaret Hamilton on my desk.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.040]   Very nice.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.040]   So yeah.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.800]   Well, this one's for you.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.840]   That would be Carson's stuff as well.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.280]   All right, Stacy, you feeling better?
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.280]   Yes.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.280]   Recovered.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   I think so.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   What you got?
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.280]   What you got?
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.320]   What do I know what I have?
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.160]   Okay.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.920]   This is something I bought at the beta store because I don't know.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.760]   I was at the beta store.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.880]   And this is for bras.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:46.600]   So this is probably 90% of your audience is going to be like, nope, done.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.080]   But I was fascinated by the idea that this is a where to go.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.920]   It's called the Soma.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920]   Let's see.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.920]   Innofit.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.880]   Made to you put this guy over you.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.680]   It's like a little sports bra looking thing.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.720]   And you try it on and it measures your boobs and your chest basically to give you the bright
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720]   bra size.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.480]   Oh, and here I am showing mine, but you've got that up on there.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.560]   So great.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.240]   And it's it is accurate.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.760]   It works with your phone.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.720]   And then the downside though for me is I paid $25 for this because it's connected and I
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.320]   had to try it.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.240]   But it locks me into buying only bras from a certain brand.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.280]   And I haven't gotten my bras yet, but the wire cutter says that they may not fit as well.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.440]   And that's disappointing because I love the idea that the company that does this is called
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.360]   like a glove.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.240]   And their goal or one of their goals is to make products like to allow you to buy clothes
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.320]   virtually that will fit you.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.160]   And that you'll have like, but it's only as good as like how the data is applied.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.800]   And this doesn't look like it's being applied very individually.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:08.600]   So that's like being able to tie my measurements to a given manufacturer is really useful.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:15.160]   And for the guys there who may not realize this, bras are sized very individually.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.600]   So a 34C in one brand is not the same as a 34C in another brand.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.320]   And it's very frustrating when you're trying to actually buy a bra.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:39.840]   So if I could make a recommendation, my wife's newest favorite subreddit is r/abrautfitz.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.920]   And they go way deep into this.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:51.520]   If we have listeners who are having trouble getting bras that fit, go to Reddit.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:56.360]   Reddit.com/r/abrautfitz.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.480]   And they will help you out.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.040]   They might even have a review of the inner fit.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.640]   The sole benefit.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640]   In a fit.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.540]   Which, you know, I'm also curious about like, hey, sensor technology and clothing is always
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.240]   like one of my favorite things.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:23.040]   So yeah, I was a little disappointed in the experience so far.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.040]   But we'll see if the bras I get are like a revelation.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.040]   Right.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]   Oh my goodness.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.040]   Never better.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.440]   Because if not, then true and co, which just has you to a questionnaire and basically
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.280]   algorithmically comes up with different across many brands.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.080]   Like the ones that would work for you, which is a way better idea than this.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.080]   Right.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.080]   Right.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.920]   Having to buy like a piece of technology to figure it out versus just going on a site
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.560]   that's really good at understanding the numbers between all the different brands.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.720]   It's kind of like which future is going to be our future.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   Right.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.800]   Which is the better future here?
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.320]   I know which one I want.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.000]   But this is more accurate.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.560]   I'd rather have that.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560]   Awesome.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.240]   That's the so much, you know, fit.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.800]   And we've included a link in the show notes to a wire cutter review of that as well to
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.680]   check out.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.280]   My pick is a new app that Google actually just announced today.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.640]   It's called Gallery Go.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.960]   And you know, Google has a lot has released a lot of its main apps in Go versions, which
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:34.000]   are basically meant to be low footprint apps, very lightweight apps that replicate much
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.760]   of the functionality of their full size app counterparts.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.440]   But in many cases, you know, it's very much intended for locations around the world that
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:52.400]   are maybe, you know, less access to data or people don't, you know, have a data plan
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.520]   in some cases or whatever their devices might be lower specked.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.320]   All of these so they don't it doesn't have enough storage to hold the larger apps.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.360]   And so this falls into that category.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   Gallery Go.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:08.400]   And I actually I don't know if you have the all about Android over the shoulder camera.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   I forgot to.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   Well, that works.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   I mean, kind of it's okay.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.400]   They're my pictures anyway.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.120]   So you don't need to see them full screen.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.080]   But it's it's all on device.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.200]   It's 10 megs for the app entirely.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.720]   It's all offline.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.800]   So none of this is synced to the web like your normal Google apps would be.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.720]   It's just everything that's stored on your device.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:38.920]   It has an auto all an auto coloration function and I can kind of do it before and after
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:46.240]   there, but cancel that also got some basic editing controls like rotate crop and a number
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.080]   of different filters and stuff that you can hop between.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.880]   And you can save a copy once you're done with that.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.520]   And I mean that that's really it.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.640]   You've got the images of course laid out there.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.560]   It seems to denote screenshots that are saved on my phone.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.200]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.880]   I guess I have a lot of screenshots saved on here.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.120]   And then it does have a section separate section for video files as well that you can go into
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.120]   as well.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.600]   So if you're looking for a lightweight gallery that isn't the full blown Google photos experience,
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:20.760]   you can look for gallery go.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.160]   It's actually available today.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.360]   Like I said, it's designed for developing markets, but it's available to all and you
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.640]   can find it in the play store for free of course.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.280]   That is gallery go.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.520]   And that as they say is that and we've reached the end of this week's episode of this week
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.280]   in Google and Stacy and Kevin, thank you so much for hopping on today with me.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.440]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]   It always is.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.960]   It is getting the chance to chat with you guys.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.600]   Too bad we never got a chance to see Kevin's glasses.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.240]   Yeah, we know it's still kind of fuzzy feed.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:03.840]   I got the Google Wi-Fi access point working on a break and for some reason it's connected
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.760]   to this new Wi-Fi point, but the uploads fee is under crap.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.480]   So I'm going to go deal with that.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   Right.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.280]   Well, if it's any consolation, I think your glasses look great in like a 280P or whatever
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.800]   we're looking at you right now.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   Not even.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.280]   Thank you.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.320]   You bet about Chromebooks.com is your site.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.160]   And of course you also do the IoT podcast along with Stacy.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.120]   Anything else you want to plug Kevin?
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.520]   Not that I can think of.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.280]   Enjoy the Apollo landing computer.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.280]   Cool.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   We'll do.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.280]   Thank you again, Kevin.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:43.280]   Always great.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:44.280]   Thanks.
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.720]   And Stacy, thanks to you each every week for doing the show and for let me fill in for
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720]   Leo this week.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.720]   I appreciate it.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.800]   Iotpodcast.com.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.560]   Stacy on IOT.com for your newsletter.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.560]   What am I missing here?
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.560]   Anything?
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.720]   No, that's it.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.720]   That's about it.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.720]   Right on.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.680]   Well, it's a pleasure as always Stacy and Kevin.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.320]   Thank you again.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.360]   And yeah, Leo's back next week.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.760]   So he'll be sitting in the hot seat.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.960]   You'll have him back on the show.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.800]   And I imagine Jeff will be back next week as well.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.800]   We'll certainly find out.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   Yes, he will.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.800]   Awesome.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.080]   Thank you, Carson, by the way, for setting all this up and producing.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.800]   Appreciate it.
