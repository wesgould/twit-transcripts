[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720]   it's Gina Tarpani from smarterware.org.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.760]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.320]   Oh, I've had espresso.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.240]   I'm going to talk fast.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.640]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.080]   She's in trouble.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.360]   Oh, you were having a problem with you.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.760]   That's for the usual.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   Fast for the usual.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.880]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.360]   Gina--
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.320]   Gina--
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.120]   Gina, Jeff's not here this week.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.880]   It's so sad.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.000]   We miss Jeff a lot.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520]   He's in Switzerland.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   Yeah, you know.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   He's-- he's--
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.680]   I'm sure there's a chocolate fountain,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920]   and he's, you know, convincing.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.000]   Poor people.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You know, I get it.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.960]   I get it.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.560]   Chocolate.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   Next week.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920]   Chocolate and cheese fountain, probably.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.000]   And it's definitely fun to do involved, you know.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.920]   Definitely.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.240]   But we got some good replacements starting with--
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.000]   Danny Sullivan is here from--
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.920]   now, it's searchengineland.com now, right?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.120]   That's right.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720]   So we want everybody to go searchengineland.com
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.360]   and not the other one.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.200]   Excellent.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Not the other one.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.640]   Not the other place.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.560]   Danny, remember the name.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.680]   Danny spends a lot of time covering this.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.000]   We were talking about preparing for the show at a time.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.720]   And we said, Danny, you're the one person who
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.640]   doesn't really have to.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.000]   This is your life.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.720]   I'm ready to go.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   This is exciting.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.840]   I'm like, oh, I could talk about that.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   I could talk about that.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.760]   I know that story.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640]   I know what's going on there.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.120]   I hope.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.080]   We'll see.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.560]   Also joining us right now, we've been trying to get them on
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.240]   for some time, a good friend of Virginia's.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.800]   Mitch Wagner, also a San Diego.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.160]   Hello.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.280]   Hey, Mitch.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.440]   Hey, glad to make it this time.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.400]   I got the day right.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.800]   And you're with-- what is the CMO site?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.600]   Tell us about that.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.200]   The CMO site, it's an online community and group
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.480]   blog for CMOs and high-level marketing executives
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.400]   at large companies.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.360]   Were the marketing elite meat?
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yes.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.680]   They do.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   Yes.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   These--
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   We're trying to work feet into there, too.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   Which seems like--
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Meat to beat their feet.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's dead out of it.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.600]   Very Sinatra.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.760]   So there's a-- you know, in the Sinatra at the Sands, 1965,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.360]   he tries to make a joke.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.440]   And I've listened to this album 1,000 times, because one
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.600]   of the great albums of all time, one of the great Sinatra
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.240]   albums of all time.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.320]   But he says, welcome to--
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.800]   oh, somewhere.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.240]   And he says, we're the elite meat to eat.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.080]   And if I rhyme that, we're out of business.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   And I'm trying to figure out, what the heck rhyme?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.920]   Well, could put them out.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   I don't understand.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   Anyway, everybody listen to that and send me emails.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   Explain it all.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.160]   But he was talking about Twitter, like, if you tweet.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800]   He was 20 years ahead of his time.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   40-- yeah, it was.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.600]   It was 1965.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.400]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   This is not the show about Frank Sinatra.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.960]   This is the show about Google and the cloud.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.560]   And there are lots of things to talk about.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.360]   It's too bad Jeff's not here, because Jeff, in the past,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.280]   and Jay Rosen and others have spent a lot of time
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   talking about and explaining to me what demand media is.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.240]   Demand media went public today, initial public offering,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.400]   the stock market.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.680]   It valued its shares before the IPO at $17.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.280]   It went immediately to $25.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.640]   Now it's falling a little bit, about $23 a share.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.280]   Danny, what is this?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Demand media.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.760]   What is this?
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.200]   Should I buy stock?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   Hmm.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.000]   Maybe this morning.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.840]   Yeah, it's too late now.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.720]   You know, I mean, it's really hard to say.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   It's a-- in some ways, this is the first huge, biggest SEO
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.320]   driven company we've ever seen.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.160]   They have taken the idea of searching
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   as an optimization to its perhaps ultimate end,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   where they are literally creating content based on what
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200]   it is that they can see people are searching for
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   and targeting areas that they think
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.280]   are most valuable, what they can sell advertising against.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   And it's actually very smart and really
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.800]   shouldn't be controversial at all either.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   I mean, if you think of all the self-help books out there
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.560]   or all the shows that are designed
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   to give you practical advice, if somebody's got questions
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.640]   and somebody else is giving them authoritative answers,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.680]   you wouldn't have a problem with that.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.520]   Where the controversy comes in is that a lot of these answers
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.120]   sometimes don't seem to be that great.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   I'm not saying all of them aren't great.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.240]   And they do have good content.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.840]   They do answer questions.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   But sometimes you can encounter the same answer
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.400]   multiple times, sometimes in low quality,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.320]   sometimes not really an answer.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.480]   And then they also can get lumped in with other content
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.000]   farm kind of sites where you don't get answers at all.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.240]   You search for something using your search
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.920]   in the form of a question and you just end up
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.000]   with a lot of garbage and kind of getting a run around.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So I don't know if that's the future or not.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.560]   I tend to think one of the problems with a company like that
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.880]   is that anytime someone gets really big on Google's radar,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.080]   it's a danger sign.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.440]   You become very dependent on that.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.120]   And one of their biggest drivers of traffic
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.560]   is coming from Google.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   - So Google can put them out of business?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.120]   - Oh yeah.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.600]   - By changing its algorithms or somehow?
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.200]   - Google could do that overnight.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.640]   And I ironically heard itself along the way
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   because a lot of demand media's money
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.200]   comes from the AdSense units that they carry
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.440]   from Google itself.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.320]   - So maybe the stock market's figuring,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.640]   well Google's never gonna do that.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.040]   It's...
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   - Yeah, and they could do that.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   They might've seen why would Google shoot itself in the foot.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.800]   But, you know, well AdSense revenue is a big deal
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.080]   to demand media, demand media's AdSense revenue.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.800]   I don't think is anything but a drop in the bucket
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.320]   to Google overall.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.920]   More important, the teams at Google
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.840]   that are in charge of search quality
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.720]   literally do not care what AdWords has to think.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.960]   They just don't.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.880]   It's like a reporter in the New York Times newsroom.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.480]   And you can imagine that some advertisers
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320]   are coming to running and saying,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.480]   "Hey, you're doing this thing on some big company."
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.800]   And we don't like it to get a poll of their ads.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   And, you know, reporter will dig in and be like,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.280]   "Well, too bad."
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.040]   And that's the kind of, I don't wanna say rivalry
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.480]   but that's the kind of division that you really do have
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.280]   at Google and I've seen that sort of thing.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   So...
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.520]   - It's not like they're a big money maker.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920]   They went off at a higher price
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.040]   and they sold more shares than the market would expect.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   In the prospectus, they say they lost $3 million
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.760]   on a $179 million in revenue for the first nine months of 2010.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.320]   They didn't have fourth quarter numbers
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.840]   but they estimated fourth quarter revenue,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   $71 to $73 million with a net loss of $1.9 million
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.600]   and not even profitable.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.680]   And yet Wall Street rewarded them and said,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.120]   "Hey, we want more."
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.560]   Is that...
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.400]   - But it's back, baby.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.440]   - Yeah, well, there haven't been a, you know,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.280]   partly it could be actually that.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.720]   There haven't, this is the first tech stock IPO of 2011.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.200]   They were very many last year.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.160]   They were all Chinese mostly.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.960]   - Nobody could buy any of that Facebook stock
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.720]   that's not even being sold publicly anyways.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.560]   - So it could just be a thirst for any technology company.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.240]   Now Matt Cutz responded to this.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.120]   Why, first of all, why would Google not like demand media?
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.840]   We know why they might like them.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.400]   Why would they not like?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.320]   Do they pollute search results?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.560]   - I think Google doesn't like the idea of anybody
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.520]   building a business on its own back,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.880]   which can sometimes be ironic.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   - But that's what everybody does.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.320]   You can't Google me.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.960]   I don't have a business either.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.360]   - When you have a company like demand going out and saying,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.400]   "We generate all this stuff at Google,"
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.360]   there's an implication or a suggestion in there
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.840]   that they know how to manipulate Google
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.800]   and they can just make it happen.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.120]   And you can imagine that is not going to go over well
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.840]   with people at Google who feel like,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.480]   "No, you're not manipulating us.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.200]   We have our own independent algorithm
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.120]   and maybe you're successful in some regards,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.720]   but you won't be successful in others,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.160]   but nobody manipulates us."
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.640]   That would be their view.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.240]   And so I think that would be the first thing
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.000]   that would cause some people at Google
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.760]   to be uncomfortable about demand.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   - Is demand media gaming Google?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.560]   I mean, is there a case for that?
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.360]   - I've not seen anybody put forward any evidence
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.520]   that they've been violating Google's guidelines.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   - No, they're doing, they're just using the system
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.640]   as it's configured to their benefit.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   - And one of the advantages they have
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.200]   is that their domains are powerful.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.960]   E-How carries some respect.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.920]   - E-How is E-How owned by demand media?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.360]   - It's one of their, yeah, it's one of their properties.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.080]   I think it's still their main property where they have to--
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.320]   - Bouch.com, which is similar, is not.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.800]   It's owned by the New York Times.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.640]   - Right.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.400]   - In fact, this made this interesting,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.440]   but demand media more valuable,
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.800]   at least via stock price,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.280]   the higher valuation than the New York Times.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.120]   - I know.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   - And now a story is coming out,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   the New York Times in fact tried to buy demand media
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.080]   to merge it with about.com.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.320]   So even old media sees the value of demand media.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   - Which is funny 'cause a year ago,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.600]   you had New York Times and a lot of newspapers saying
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.040]   that they couldn't make money off of search engines
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.160]   and they had to put up a paywall.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.840]   And in fact, the New York Times is about literally
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.800]   about to do that, right?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.080]   - That's why they wanna buy these guys.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.360]   Hey, they figured it out.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.840]   But demand media doesn't have a paywall,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.040]   they just do it the advertising.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.200]   So they're just very, very smart.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.560]   - And one thing that I think we talked about last time,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.400]   we talked about demand,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.720]   is that any good blog or web publisher watches the ways
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.400]   in which visitors reach the site.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.200]   We did this at Life Hacker the whole time.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   It wasn't, I mean, it's pretty much exactly what demand's doing.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.800]   They're looking, what are people searching for?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.200]   What information do they need?
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   We're gonna find it.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.600]   We're gonna package it in a way that maybe is more useful
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.120]   than the list of links that you get on a topic now.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.840]   - In fact, sometimes it feels like old media judgmentalism
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.440]   that, oh, well, this is an upstart, an internet upstart.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.560]   - Right, this idea that they're gaming Google.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.640]   I mean, the same way you could put,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   well, that they're servicing their visitors,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.440]   they're serving readers.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.880]   I mean, you can look at it either way.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.240]   And certainly some of the articles from some of the demand
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.720]   properties are kinda crappy, but not all of them are.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.600]   I mean, it really depends.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.280]   - They're kinda, I find the articles there
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.040]   to be kinda mediocre at best.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.320]   We were joking before the show started that I was looking
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.280]   up how to do a hard reset on the iPhone.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.240]   And one of the things that came up on these content farm
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.960]   was 350 words on, turn it off and turn it back on again.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.560]   - All right, but I'm gonna put my hat on
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.960]   as Mr. Demand Media, I don't know who he is, but.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   So I'm Mr. Demand Media, look, I don't care,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.720]   I mean, that's old media, that's old school saying,
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.240]   who are you to judge the value of my articles?
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.200]   At least people come to them and click on them and read them.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.840]   - In the immortal words of Captain Kirk,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.040]   who do I have to be?
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.920]   (laughing)
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.840]   - I'm just a guy at 10 o'clock at night
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.360]   and you're trying to remember a new product
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.680]   that's a life woman, I'm not.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.560]   - So on that site, this happens all the time.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.080]   - So your contention, Mitch Wagner, is that it pollutes,
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.400]   the content is low grade pollution, essentially.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.280]   - I have found that if you're looking up,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.000]   I haven't done the study on this like Danny has,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.280]   but I found if you're looking up either health information
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.600]   or you're looking up Mac and Apple related information,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.160]   which is two things I do a lot.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.880]   The first page or two is garbage.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.120]   It's just all word of mouth and people asking questions
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   and a lot of these content forms.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.880]   - We've gone through this with Google before,
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.000]   where you had a lot of link farms.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   And for a while, I can't remember two or three years ago,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.640]   Google was just crap, and then they fixed it.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.480]   - Yeah.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.560]   - And now I've seen there's a kind of a growing drumbeat
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.720]   from a lot of people saying,
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.360]   Google's search results are getting less and less useful.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.320]   Are you hearing that, Danny?
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.840]   - Oh yeah, and in fact, it's even accelerated
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.720]   over the past six weeks.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.640]   We had a tech crunch piece that kicked off
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.840]   the latest round at the beginning of the year.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.800]   That was followed up by two or three different pieces
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.640]   that came off after that, where people were saying,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.840]   the results are crappy, the results aren't as useful
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.560]   as anymore, and they're being dominated by all this stuff.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440]   I don't know that that's actually true,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.240]   but I do know more and more people are talking about it.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.640]   I did an article that looked at one study of a consumer poll
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.760]   that found that it was like 90% of the people surveyed
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.480]   still said search engines overall are useful,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.240]   and I still find what I'm looking for.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.920]   But the same survey found that like 70% said,
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.720]   the biggest problem wasn't that they couldn't find
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.080]   what they were looking for, but there was a lot of noise.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.320]   So I think there's a perception
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.560]   that there's much more noise here.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.400]   - Even Google thinks so.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.160]   I'm looking at a blog post from our friend Matt Cutz,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.480]   who's been on the show a number of times,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.760]   who is a Google engineer in charge of, in fact,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.960]   killing spam on the web results.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.240]   And he wrote a couple of days ago,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.960]   January brought a spate of stories
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   about Google search quality.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.840]   - Right, and he linked Jeff Atwood's
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.920]   coding horror tech crunch and read write web
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   in that spate of stories phrase, which I loved.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.400]   - He says, Google search quality's better
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.520]   than it has ever been in terms of relevance,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.160]   freshness and comprehensiveness.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.640]   I mean, what is there an objective measure of that?
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.920]   I guess he says there is.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.840]   - Well, that's one of the things that I covered
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.720]   in the story that, hey Matt, you didn't even link to it.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.240]   - Yeah, let's see those evaluation metrics.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.440]   - I've been talking about, and I actually wrote a piece
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.240]   way back in 2002 called In Search of the Relevancy Figure.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   And what I was saying was that you want people to,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.000]   people want to be able to say this search engine is better
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.640]   than that and be able to quantify it.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.760]   But we've never had that because the relevancy
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.120]   of search results is so subjective.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.040]   So in-
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.520]   - This is the so-called authority metric.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.600]   - Well, authority, are they relevant or not?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.560]   You get these proxies, we've had people say,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.080]   "Well, Google must be better than being,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.480]   "or being better than Google because one has more pages
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.320]   "than the other."
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.680]   Well, that doesn't tell you anything.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.320]   Or that one's fresher than the other.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.520]   That doesn't mean that they're necessarily more relevant.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   We literally do not have a commonly accepted standard
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.640]   of rating the search engines to know whether or not
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.600]   they are better than each other or worse.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   And whether they've gotten better or worse over time
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.720]   in terms of the quality of their results.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.560]   Internally, they will tell you that they do their own testing.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.520]   But that's their own measure,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.200]   and it's not something that the people externally
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.360]   necessarily are going to agree with.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.520]   And surprise, usually in the years
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   I've been watching the search engines,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.200]   their internal metrics tell them that they're pretty good.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.240]   - Right.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.880]   - So what I'd hope is that Google,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.320]   being especially, would get together,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.520]   find some third party to figure out a way
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.280]   to go through and test whether or not they are more spammy,
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.920]   or they are less relevant, or if things are improving.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.680]   And I don't think Google's had the incentive to do that
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   before because everybody just accepted that they were the best.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   But now it's been a turnabout where everybody
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.120]   thinks that they were the best.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.680]   More people seem to be more inclined to say,
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.280]   "Oh yeah, I do think that they're worse,
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.120]   "even if they aren't necessarily worse,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.440]   "or worse than some of the other search engines."
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.640]   - There's at least some competition.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.680]   I mean, you can at least say,
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.360]   "Well, let's look at Bing and see how it's doing."
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.040]   But isn't it ultimately,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.120]   well, you ask you this, Mitch, isn't it ultimately,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.800]   you said you didn't like the results,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.040]   but isn't that ultimately subjective?
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.640]   Is there an objective measure of relevancy?
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   Isn't one man's garbage and other man's treasure?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.640]   - Well, I don't know if you're looking
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.240]   for specific information, like how to do something.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.080]   I don't think it's much.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.840]   - People need to know you turn it off and on.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.800]   Maybe they need to know that.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.240]   Maybe you're an elitist.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.280]   - Press the button.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.840]   It's off, press the button.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.440]   It's on, how hard is that?
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.360]   I mean, I think one site, by the way,
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.440]   I wanted to bring up that I think does a really good job
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.240]   on this kind of content farming
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.680]   and does content farming ethically is Life Hacker.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.120]   Because I don't really read Life Hacker anymore,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.640]   but when I have a question on how to do something,
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   if I type it into Google,
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.400]   when I see a Life Hacker link come by the top,
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.440]   I'm like, "Yeah, that's it.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.680]   "That's gonna be good."
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.840]   - I mean, I love to use the word content farming.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.680]   Life Hacker in the same sentence.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.960]   (laughing)
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.800]   I mean, that makes me,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   that makes my skin crawl a little bit,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.080]   I'll admit, because there's something sort of,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   you know, that there's a negative light right there.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   But the reality is that Life Hacker has some
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.640]   of the best Google SEO of all the Gawker sites,
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.840]   which is a huge network of sites.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   And a lot of that is just because our headlines
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.880]   are generally how to do X, you know?
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.680]   And it's at which people, that's what people search for.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   People search for how to use,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.320]   eHow figured that out a long time ago.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.200]   Life Hacker's headlines are very literal.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   They're often just very step-by-steps.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.960]   And so yeah, they get a lot of traffic.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.520]   And Life Hacker editors watch the comments
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.160]   and watch the keywords that bring people in
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.600]   and watch the emails that come in.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.920]   So we very much, the articles that you see on the site
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.440]   come from direct requests from readers.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.320]   So they come up and search results.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.000]   I search for phrases and I find Life Hacker articles
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.740]   that I wrote in like, '07 come up.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.300]   - I knew that, I forgot I knew that.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.760]   - Yeah, I forgot I knew that, I forget.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.560]   So yeah, so I mean, I think, you know,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.880]   this calling it a content farm or calling it, you know,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.800]   a site with good content and high SEO for good reason.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.520]   And that's, there's a continuum there.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.320]   It's really hard to say what it is.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.160]   - So good content is not like porn, or is it?
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.520]   I'll know it when I see it.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.760]   (laughs)
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.360]   - Yeah, I think it is like porn.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.520]   - So there's, we could all, I think you're right.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.240]   I think if the four of us sat down
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.280]   and I fired up four pages,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.480]   we could pretty quickly say
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.960]   which are the good ones and which aren't.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.800]   Right?
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.520]   I think so.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.920]   - Would we judge some of it by the number of ads on the page?
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.040]   - Well, if there's an ad covering the entire page
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.320]   before I look at the article,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.200]   then that's gonna, that's gonna rate on it down.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.120]   - Well, I gotta mention this,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.400]   quite a few prestigious websites that do that.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.160]   In fact, almost all the tech sites now do that.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.240]   I hate it.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.520]   - Yeah, me too, me too.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.560]   - Yeah.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.480]   - Almost the mainstream news sites now,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.520]   but the big, so this is really disingenuous.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   Page loading.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.320]   (laughing)
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.280]   - Watch this ad for 15, 14, 13.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040]   And then, and then skip this ad.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's like, well, if you're gonna put an ad up,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.880]   why put a skip this ad link?
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.720]   Make me watch it.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.520]   I don't understand.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.400]   - What I would like to see,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.480]   and I've actually seen this,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.400]   I visited a company that competes with Google,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   which I can't name,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.600]   but internally, who has been developing a search engine,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.520]   and internally, they had a simple web app
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.440]   with Google on one side and their product on the other.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.160]   They would search and then they would submit the results
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.680]   if they felt like Google got it better.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.840]   So all we need, this is a very simple web app,
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.280]   that just lines up Google against the other search engines.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.440]   You search for a term,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.320]   and then you report something to some sort of third party,
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.520]   or I don't know, the creator of the app to say,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.480]   this is a search in which Google's results were terrible,
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.120]   and this one was better, or whatever.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.200]   And that would be pretty cool,
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.520]   crowd-sourced way, and public way,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.960]   transparent way to say,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.680]   the results on Google are better in these cases,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.120]   and worse in those cases.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   Matt Cutt says, "As pure web scam has decreased over time,"
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.240]   in other words, just junk,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.480]   "Attention has shifted instead to, quote, content farms,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.880]   "which are sites with shallow or low quality content."
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.800]   Sounds like demand media, right?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.400]   "In 2010, we launched two major algorithmic changes,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.880]   "focusing on low quality sites."
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.600]   So they are, they say, doing something about it.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.040]   I don't know, I mean,
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.320]   it reminds me of when spyware started to come out,
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.960]   and the antivirus companies were very reluctant
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.640]   to battle spyware because they didn't wanna get sued,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   because spyware or adware was just an ad,
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.440]   it wasn't malware, that's changed, I think, over time.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.040]   But it does remind me of that is,
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.160]   couldn't, I mean, isn't it very judgmental
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.600]   to say that's low quality?
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.440]   No.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.720]   (laughing)
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.760]   But then, and then it's in like,
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.560]   I'll give you an example of where it comes up.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:43.680]   So I've got two boys, and they're both in elementary school,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   and they are making Vanajat and Bieber once,
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.880]   and I've used this example before, but I said to him,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.160]   "Well, you know, you might make fun of him,
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.600]   "but he seemed to be pretty successful."
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.080]   And they said, "Oh, no, no, he's not successful, you know,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.160]   "he probably not made any money at all."
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   I was like, "Well, I think he's probably done
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.600]   "a little better than you guys."
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.200]   So we went back, and we went to do a search,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.760]   and bearing in mind, like, I'm, you know,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.240]   a search expert, right?
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.360]   You know, this is what I do is find information online.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.000]   So we go off and I start doing some search
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   and just to find out, well, how much money
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.960]   has Justin Bieber made?
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.360]   And you start doing that search,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.080]   and what you do is encounter time and time again,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.160]   answer sites, YahooAnswers, answers.com.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.920]   Oh my God, cha-cha, you know,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.520]   wiki answers, answers this, blah, blah, blah.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.480]   And none of them have the answer.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.040]   None of them have the answer.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.680]   They have people guessing at an answer.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.080]   They have people pretending that they know the answer.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.440]   Sometimes they have answers that have nothing to do with it.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.000]   - Yeah, okay, that would be bad.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.280]   - To me, that is shallow or low quality content.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.520]   And they're doing well because more and more people
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.080]   seem to be comfortable and performing searches
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.840]   in the form of a question.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.640]   Relatively few other websites on the internet
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.320]   actually write content in the form of questions, right?
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.640]   They don't tend to do the SEO like what Gina was talking
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.560]   about, what you think, well, gosh,
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.880]   someone's gonna sit down, they're typing,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.320]   and how do I, this sort of thing?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.400]   So their competition space is lower,
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.280]   and they have these authoritative domains.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.600]   And I think that's what, you know,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.480]   Matt and Google are saying that they're grappling with.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.560]   Some of these things sometimes do have the answers.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.840]   They do have good quality information,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.120]   and some of them just don't.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.880]   And should we get rid of them?
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.520]   And is there, and most important,
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.800]   because they're there, are they blocking the real answers
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.240]   from actually being found?
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.440]   - Right.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.720]   I wonder to what extent people,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.200]   the general run of searching public will have to,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.720]   we'll find out.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.000]   I mean, I think it took most of us watch it more closely,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.560]   and it took us a few months to realize,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.640]   if it's anyhow, link, I just don't wanna click it.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.040]   So I'm coming here with you.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.680]   - I guess the question is should Google put it
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.480]   in the results then, or rank it so highly then?
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.920]   - Ooh, then that gets into the question of,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.040]   do they start blocking specific domains,
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.200]   which they have been extremely reluctant to do?
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.800]   - Can't you say don't ever show me eHow again?
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.040]   - If you log in, all right.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.080]   - You used to be able to do that through search wiki.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.480]   And I think they may still have that,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.760]   but it was on a page by page basis.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.160]   And in fact, after Matt's post came out,
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.720]   he did another follow up thing.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.920]   This was out on Hacker News,
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.040]   and we did a short piece on it at Search in Jelan,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.840]   where he was saying, we might come back
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.760]   and give you the option to block whole domains.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   Yahoo actually had something like that as well,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.080]   and I can't remember exactly what it was called at this point,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.920]   but you could say, I just don't wanna see anything else
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.760]   from this domain.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.440]   - Well, that would solve the problem, right?
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.040]   'Cause then I'm judging, I don't like the domain,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.160]   and I can block it.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.000]   - I mean, you can always do minus site colon eHow.com.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.080]   But you're not, it's too much trouble, yeah.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.920]   - Yeah.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.280]   - So I can't remember if Blacko has a slash tag.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.720]   Blacko says that they have certain slash tags over there.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.600]   They're designed to keep content farms out,
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.960]   and other lower quality content.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.880]   But I can't remember if they created a slash tag
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.400]   that if you use it automatically drops out
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.920]   the most common Q&A sites.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.760]   That would be interesting.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   - Who's that?
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.280]   - Blacko. - Blacko?
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.600]   - So spell it.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.920]   - B-L-E-K-K-O.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.760]   - Oh, Blacko.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.600]   - Blacko.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.160]   - Yeah, we actually, we haven't talked about Blacko
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.000]   on the show.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   - We talked about when it first came out.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.840]   That's the one where you do the slash tag.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.680]   - Yeah.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.120]   - And I mean, most of the time, I think a slash tag
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.600]   explicitly includes sites.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.560]   So this would also solve the problem if you had,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.640]   if I create a slash tag on tech news,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   I'm not gonna include a site.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.120]   I could say, I'm not gonna include a site
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.800]   that has interstitial ads.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.080]   I mean, I could do anything I want.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.160]   But that's, so, but nobody uses Blacko.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.400]   - Not yet, but I mean, what is interesting is
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.840]   here, Blacko came out and they said,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.160]   well, we're gonna, we're gonna come out
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.640]   and try to compete in this space
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.400]   that everybody else has been crushed in.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.120]   And what they've done phenomenally well in
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.360]   is convincing people,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.440]   sadly, that Google has a spam problem
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.920]   and that they do their own pushing out.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.960]   And they actually launched something called a spam clock.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.880]   I think it's at the spamclock.com.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.440]   And they said, this is the amount of spam
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.720]   that's coming along.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.680]   They have convinced some people
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.280]   that they actually have a better search algorithm,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.680]   even though they don't necessarily
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.080]   have a better search algorithm than Google.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.640]   - They're using Google, aren't they?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   - No, no, they're crawling the web
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   and they're doing their own searching as well.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.280]   But they're getting themselves counted with, you know,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.600]   the big players because there's so few big players left.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.680]   I just did a thing the other day
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   when the Academy Awards came out
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.240]   and I was kind of curious, well,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.440]   who was getting you to the right place,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.160]   you know, for the nominee list right at the very beginning.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.280]   And it was like, okay, I'm gonna compare Google
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.440]   and I'll compare Bing and, oh yeah, or Blacko.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.160]   'Cause that's what I'm left with if I'm talking about--
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.520]   - Google Bing, it drops off, it's quite a cliff.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.680]   (laughing)
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.040]   It drops off fast.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.000]   - Google Bing, Blacko.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.680]   - It's kind of fun to say, actually.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.160]   - I do like, now I'm starting to like it.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.360]   I'm gonna Blacko you.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.280]   (laughing)
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.760]   - Not on the first date, we know.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.680]   No, no Blackoing on the first date.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   Yeah, by the way, who was the best?
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.640]   'Cause I have to say immediately,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.960]   I get up in the morning and I wanna find out
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.200]   who the nominees are.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.720]   And I Google Academy Award nominees,
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.040]   but there are a lot of articles that don't have a list.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.200]   So it wasn't easy.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   - I found it was a pretty close tie
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   between Bing and Google.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.480]   Both of them, and then I looked within, say,
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.320]   15 minutes and then coming out.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.160]   Both of them had their newsboxes at the top.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.960]   So there were lots of news articles about it,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.120]   but I was thinking, I just wanna find the list.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.920]   And Google listed it at number one,
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.120]   the Oscar website, it's homepage.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.040]   You went to there and the list was right at the top.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.280]   Black, being listed the actual nominees page
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.560]   at the Oscar site.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.920]   So you kinda wanna give 'em an edge,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.240]   except that page was exactly the same as the homepage.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.520]   Blacko, which of course has gotten some praise
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.560]   in very places, was listing a page that was 404
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.480]   on the Oscar site.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   - Ooh.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.320]   - Ooh.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.240]   - So that was a failure.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.720]   And they're gonna have to step it up
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.320]   to be fighting among those other players.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720]   - Bad, Blacko.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   - Wow.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.400]   (laughing)
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.600]   - For news like that, I probably would have searched Twitter.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.160]   For like something that happened,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.400]   that got announced in the last 10, 15 minutes,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.360]   I probably would have just searched Twitter.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.320]   - Yeah, yes, there's social search jumping right up.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.240]   - Well, in fact, it was Twitter that even alerted me
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.760]   to the fact that the nominees were out.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.600]   - That's right, me too.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.280]   - That's right.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.640]   I saw that and then I said, "Oh, let me get them."
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.720]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.040]   - My mistake was going to Google at that point, apparently.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.840]   I should have just read the tweets.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.200]   - Yeah, I think the tweet that I saw actually have a link.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.560]   So I didn't actually even search Twitter.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.400]   - That's what happened to me too.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.080]   - Yeah, I mean, once in a while, I'll go to search.switter.com,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.840]   especially if there's like a reality show
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.120]   on the airing on the East Coast,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.600]   and I just wanna know the winner, that kind of thing.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.720]   - So now I can just blame the curation.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.280]   By the way, and I'll make this my tool of the week
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.680]   and a little bit, Matt, actually,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.800]   there's a Chrome extension that Matt mentions
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.400]   in his blog post so that you can report,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.600]   and I think this is probably the best solution to this,
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.080]   is let users say, "Hey, I found a site,
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.040]   "but it really sure wasn't what I was looking for,
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.880]   "sure wasn't the information I needed."
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.640]   And you can now use it, there's a Chrome extension
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.960]   you can use to tell that.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.120]   - To tell that. - Oh, the report's public.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.000]   I want the reports to be public.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.840]   - Ah, yeah.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.600]   - I doubt that they are, but I would love that.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.120]   - Yeah, I don't think they are.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.560]   That's why I would love to see a third party
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.200]   set up something like that,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   where the community can post bad search results
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.880]   and have it be public so that other people can also see.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.240]   - Is this something like the Academy of France says,
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.680]   preserving the purity of the French language by deciding?
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.560]   I mean, I sometimes feel like a little bit,
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.080]   this is a little bit like old media saying,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.040]   "Well, that's not good."
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.000]   Do they hire a $5 writer to write a silly article
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.480]   about something?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.520]   - Well, I think if you go back again to what Gina was saying
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   about what Life Hacker was doing
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.880]   or what other sites may do,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.360]   it's not I think that demand media is necessarily
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.960]   or any some of the content farms have done something wrong.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.680]   It's that most of these other publications existed
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.120]   because they're covering that area.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.400]   They didn't say, "Ah, I know, let's go figure out."
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.920]   - It started from their own interest as opposed to what--
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.600]   - Yeah, there's some reason it was an area
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.560]   that they actually had people dedicated to do.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.720]   And then you've got other players coming in saying,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.280]   "Hey, instead of figuring out what particular area
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.240]   "we got to cover on and specialize in
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.200]   "and perhaps provide exceptional coverage in,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.120]   "let's cover everything anybody's interested in
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.440]   "that is most likely to make money
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.320]   "and let's pay as little as possible to the people
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.080]   "to create that content."
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   - That's the difference.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.400]   - Which is a clever business model,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.160]   but it kind of rubs you the wrong way, right?
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.640]   It rubs me the wrong way. - That's the difference.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.400]   - Yeah, and then there's the whole separate issue
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.720]   of just driving down wages for writers,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.640]   which is a writer myself I'm not exactly in love with.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.440]   - Yeah, well that's what I mean.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.040]   - Yeah, we've been having this argument on the CMO site
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.320]   with a bunch of people defending it
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.400]   and by coming out and saying,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   "Look, you're just better off working at Starbucks."
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.960]   Write your own blog and your spare time.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.640]   - And you'll feel better about yourself
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   at the end of the day too.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   - And you'll have like health insurance and stuff.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   (laughing)
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.920]   And I finally had to come out and say,
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.040]   "Look, I'm not being metaphorical here."
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.400]   - I mean it. - Literally.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.440]   - Go to work. - It's not.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.600]   - You know, if you...
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.520]   Hey, do you get free Trenti Lates
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.880]   if you work at Starbucks?
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.280]   'Cause I might do that.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.440]   - The Trenti Latte is so big
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.040]   you have to take a Starbucks break
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.160]   in the middle of drinking it
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.520]   because you don't have enough energy.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.680]   - No, apparently.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   (laughing)
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.120]   You're not far off.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.640]   Apparently 30 ounces is actually bigger
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.800]   than the capacity of the human stomach.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.760]   So you really couldn't,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.240]   I wouldn't want to drink it all at once.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.320]   You'd herb up.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.640]   (laughing)
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.400]   - And who says you don't learn something
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.280]   on this week in Google?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.720]   Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen,
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.560]   we're gonna take a break.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.480]   I do want to talk a little bit about the,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.000]   you know, a little story that broke the day
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.600]   after we did Twig last week.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.560]   Eric Schmidt steps down.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.360]   Whoops, I guess we should have led with that.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   Talk about throwing-- - Step up.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   Step up. - Step up.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.280]   Step up. (laughing)
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.400]   - He was not elevated.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.240]   - He was elevated out of here.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.600]   - For example, he was on the escalator.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.920]   - He was elevated right out of the building.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.000]   - And out of the building.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.840]   (laughing)
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.640]   - And I do want to talk about a new Stish Elad
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.960]   actually now that you brought it up, Gina,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.920]   because TechCrunch, actually Mike Errington,
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.280]   posted very interesting article on TechCrunch
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.680]   yesterday apologizing for the ads on his site.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.880]   Hmm.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.320]   We'll dig deep into that in just a little bit
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.360]   before we go much further though,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.280]   I would like to say hello.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.520]   Hello to my good friends at Ford.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.120]   The makers of the fine Ford Focus Electric,
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.960]   my next car.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.840]   It's gonna come out in 2012.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.960]   But yes, I will be replacing my lovely Ford Mustang,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.040]   which I deeply love with the Ford Focus.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.560]   First of all, 'cause I want to be a good citizen
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.400]   and I like the electric,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.520]   but also they've upgraded the Ford Sync,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.040]   which I have to the now the new My Ford Touch.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.960]   Now understands 10,000 commands.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.320]   Of course, it's true hands-free dialing.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.800]   Call Gina Trapani on her cell and it will,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.160]   and it does it.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.760]   It's playing the music you want or the podcast you want.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.160]   Play this week in Google, episode 78, it does it.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.520]   It works with your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.800]   your, all the different devices.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.560]   In fact, if you've got an Android phone,
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.360]   some of the Android phones like the Droid X,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.240]   it will read you your text messages
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.140]   as they come in in a lovely female voice.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.000]   It's just fantastic.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Now they've got Pandora and Stitcher.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.440]   So that you can listen to the radio you want.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   With Stitcher, you can listen to us,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.680]   just queue up a bunch of twigs.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.200]   The Ford Focus Electric for 2012 has lithium ion batteries,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.440]   very high capacity.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.760]   You can charge it from your standard 120 volt outlet,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.320]   but they also will, they're going with the folks
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.120]   at Best Buy, the Geek Squad will come
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.720]   in at this tall, 240 volt outlet.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.960]   I'm not kidding in your house.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   For three hour charging.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.600]   I can't wait, it is a beautiful vehicle.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.880]   You know, you want to see the inside of it,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.560]   go to focuselectricpower.com.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.400]   Focus on the non-profit, sorry.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.960]   Focuselectricpower.com.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.320]   And you can learn more about this amazing vehicle.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.360]   It is just so beautiful.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.800]   I saw it at a blog room and then again at CES.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.080]   By the way, John C. Devorak and Paul Therat are going
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.040]   to test drive it next month in Madrid.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.760]   And we're going to get a report from them doing that,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   but you could find out more.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.520]   It's almost like, it's like a virtual test drive.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.160]   There's going to be an iPhone app, an Android app
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.120]   that lets you check your battery levels
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.080]   and tell it to charge during off peak hours,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.560]   things like that, complete control.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.520]   Just so slick and very affordable.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.160]   Focuselectricpower.com.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   Thank you for supporting this week in Google.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.640]   Now that's an interstitial ad.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   I mean, that's traditional broadcast ad.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.400]   But we're just saying how much we hate that
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.560]   when a website, and the thing is,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.240]   it's before you even get to the site,
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.080]   you have to look at an ad like this.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.320]   TechCrunch will move in just a few seconds.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.400]   And actually, this is Mike Arrington writing,
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.440]   "Real blogs don't have it, or stichel ads."
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.240]   He said, "I've fought this for years.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.280]   "Apparently AOL is putting these ads on TechCrunch."
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.640]   They got to pay for buying it some way.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.920]   Yeah, Mike.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.280]   Mike is, you know, I'm convinced Mike has a strategy
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.200]   to get out of with your AOL.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.800]   I was going to say, I would love to have been in
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.440]   on the meetings that happened after this post,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.600]   because I have been in meetings like this at Gawker,
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.960]   which is a much, much smaller company than AOL.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.280]   And they are never pretty.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.120]   So I would have loved to have seen the AOL folks,
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.280]   sales teams faces after he posted this.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.360]   Although I give Arrington a lot of credit for--
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.240]   Hey, he's manly.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   I mean, first he goes after Josh Topolsky,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.040]   the Engadget blog, and AOL,
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.120]   probably the most profitable AOL property,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.560]   and calls them all sorts of names wrongly, by the way.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.440]   But, you know, I'll defend Josh to my dying day.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.840]   I think Engadget's great, and I think they do a great job.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.480]   But now he's going after the ad department.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.160]   Now you're in trouble, Mike.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.320]   I think it's pretty entertaining.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.640]   I don't really give him a lot of credit.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.600]   He took their money, and now he doesn't want to work
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.440]   for them anymore.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.280]   Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.080]   He says, whoever did it, I'm going to try to stop it,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   was we probably involved six hours of eternal meetings
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.120]   in at least one PowerPoint deck.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.480]   So at least you know it's going to cause me
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.640]   a lot more pain than it's causing you.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.760]   (laughing)
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.120]   Yeah, I mean, I guess I've written a few of these.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.480]   Like, we really screwed up with our ads on Life Hacker myself.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.680]   And whenever it happens, it's always
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.120]   this very traumatic experience.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   Although I think Mike is a lot more,
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.560]   he just has a kind of temperament
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.960]   that's a lot better for this kind of stuff.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.760]   I'd be honest with you.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.600]   I would--
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.440]   Yeah, I was projecting.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.560]   Yeah, I wouldn't want to be in that meeting with Mike.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.960]   (laughing)
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.000]   Yeah, there's always the question of how much AOL
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.240]   is kind of aware of this, and sanctions it.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.080]   It's a way to build traffic.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.880]   Oh yeah, maybe, you know.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.960]   I've seen that happen in radio,
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.800]   it happens all the time.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.320]   I remember Don Imus used to work with a guy named Pete Franklin.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.480]   Franklin was in the morning.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.560]   Franklin was in the afternoon.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.520]   It was, I think it's on WNBC in New York.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.920]   And they had a quote feud,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.880]   it was I'm sure it was all play.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.600]   At one point, Franklin steals into Imus' studio
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.520]   and takes the microphone.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.840]   And Imus comes in the morning.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.680]   There's no microphone.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.800]   He actually did the show by phone.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.960]   Now you gotta figure WNBC.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.720]   There's another microphone.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   It's all stick, right?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.400]   It's all stick.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.120]   I think it's just,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.960]   it's probably just stick here, but I think it's fascinating.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.240]   All right, let's talk about Eric Schmidt,
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.120]   'cause really we should've led with that.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   Thursday, during the Google earnings call,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.080]   kind of a surprise.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   Larry Page, Sergey Brin,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.120]   and Eric Schmidt got on the phone,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.040]   and Eric says, you know, April 4th,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.240]   I am out of here, actually, you know,
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.880]   what is he, is the executive director?
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.720]   (laughing)
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.560]   Executive chairman.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.400]   Executive chairman.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.080]   Which is a,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.920]   - Executive something.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.040]   - That's a made up title, I think.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.880]   Well, it's hard to say.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.480]   According to the reports I've seen,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.640]   he's gonna be responsible for a lot of external relations
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.040]   and partnerships,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.240]   and dealing with government,
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.880]   which is a lot of what CEOs traditionally do.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.800]   Well, yeah, in fact,
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.120]   he was off to do that right after the announcement, right?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.000]   It's very strange to say that he's not gonna be,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.560]   to say that Larry Page is gonna be the CEO now,
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.040]   but Eric Schmidt's gonna be dealing
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.360]   with all these external relations,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.640]   is like saying that someone's gonna be a cook now,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.960]   but someone else is gonna prepare the food.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.160]   I mean, in other companies, external relations
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.200]   is a huge part of the CEO's job.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.480]   So it's a very interesting development here.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.760]   And they've got Sergey Brin to be the product guy.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.800]   This is kind of how Google used to be,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.080]   before Eric Schmidt.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.040]   Larry was the kind of the executive, right?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.640]   I mean, that's someone I seem to remember.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   - He was CEO, before.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.760]   - He was CEO, and so this is just taking back his old job.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.880]   It did seem like very friendly,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.960]   but then we're seeing all sorts of rumors like,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.120]   this is from the New York Post,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.160]   probably considered the source.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.240]   Google honcho, Eric Schmidt, who announced his plan
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.120]   to hand over control of the tech giant last week,
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.000]   is eyeballing a career in TV, page six learns.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.080]   And I'd read you the rest of the story,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.520]   but there's some sort of interstitial ad
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.360]   telling it up.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.520]   - There's a little interstitial ad that's taking over it.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.360]   It's lovely.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.200]   Listen, I'm from New York.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.520]   You don't read the post.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   Let's not read the post.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.360]   - All right.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.200]   You don't believe that?
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.040]   - I thought you'd be the post.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.480]   But there have been other reports of the TV show,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.920]   which is just weird.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.040]   I mean, I just, I think I've sat on the show before.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.880]   Schmidt always kind of put me off.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.920]   - And this is a face made for TV.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   Don't you wanna just tune right in and see what old potato
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.760]   - You're not right.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.080]   - What old potato head has to say?
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.000]   - You're not right.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.920]   You're not right.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.720]   - So I have free theories as to what's going on here.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.240]   One of them, theory one, is from the guy
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.920]   who usually sits to the right here.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.360]   I think that was where I read it,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   which is that this has been foreordained from the beginning.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.680]   - Ah.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.280]   - 10 years ago, they made a deal that this wasn't.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.880]   - Yeah, it wasn't really so much of a deal.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   It was just kind of the idea that,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.680]   I think it was Jeff who wrote this,
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.520]   that Eric was always kind of the regent
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.840]   who would rule until the true heir to the throne.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.880]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.720]   - That's interesting.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.960]   - My second theory, which is mine and by me,
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.680]   is that this is a man who's 55 years old.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.080]   He has, I mean--
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.240]   - How does he survive?
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.280]   How does he get up in the morning?
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.120]   - I don't know.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.080]   - He got $100 million just recently.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:08.920]   - Yeah.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.080]   - Who was not his first career success?
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   - He's crying out loud.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.360]   He's got his double ARP card.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.320]   Put him to bed.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.400]   Give him some sort.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.200]   - I'm just gonna keep talking seriously here.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   Well, you guys just--
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.800]   - I'm 54, that's all I'm saying.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.320]   I'm saying, this is, I'm saying,
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.760]   this is just not his first career triumph.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.320]   He probably just wants to do something else.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.520]   - Former CEO in Novel.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.000]   - And was successful there.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.640]   Former executive at Sun was successful there.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.000]   He's, if you read his Wikipedia article,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.920]   apparently he wrote it in a handy little Unix utility too
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.760]   in between.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.280]   He was integral in pushing Microsoft off its perch.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.480]   Anybody remember Microsoft?
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   They used to be a big company.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.320]   - Yeah.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.760]   - This is a guy who probably wants to go do something else.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.600]   - So--
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   - But it's interesting.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.440]   - It's interesting.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.560]   - Offered this bonus for him.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.200]   $10 million award if he sticks around
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.080]   for another six years.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.000]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   I didn't know there was a continue.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.520]   So, yeah, I thought he just got the money.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.480]   - No, he's got to stick around.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.160]   This is what, this Reuters story is saying.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.000]   - That's interesting.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.640]   - He, Schmidt said he expected to spend another
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   10 years of the company and this $100 million award,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.320]   he would have, it's an equity award
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.080]   and to get it, he'd have to stick around for six.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:21.920]   - Can I just point out,
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.520]   because it has worth more than $4 billion.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.280]   A hundred million in cigarette money.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.840]   - A hundred million isn't even.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.680]   - Yeah.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   - That's for the tip.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   - Yeah, it's like not even, what is, it's not nothing.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.520]   It's so point-seated.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   - Okay, that just means he's sad.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.840]   I'm just gonna leave now.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.680]   I can't--
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.040]   - I think he, I think all of this is disinformation.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   You know what I think is gonna happen?
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.440]   In six months, he's gonna be the CEO at Apple.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.760]   You watch, you mark my words.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.120]   (laughs)
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.960]   - Oh boy.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   (laughs)
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   That would be a trip.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.520]   (laughs)
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.360]   - Why not?
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.960]   Isn't that what he and Steve Jobs were talking about?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.520]   When they had that little coffee clatch?
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.920]   - Oh, the coffee clatch.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.640]   Interesting, interesting.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.000]   - Remember Steve was overheard saying,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.040]   well, they're all gonna find out eventually anyway?
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.680]   - Actually, what they were talking about was,
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   did you hear that they have this train day law tape?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.040]   (laughs)
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.240]   - They're the capacity of the human stomach.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.960]   - They were planning to take over the world
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   with near-field communications, right?
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.960]   - It'd be a hundred million dollar equity award
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.000]   best over four years.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.960]   - Vests. - So that's how it vests.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.320]   - It vests. - Okay, okay.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.280]   That's not unusual to have that kind of a structure.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.960]   Yeah, you don't just give somebody something,
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.240]   you expect something to return.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.360]   - So we didn't hear Mitch's third theory.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.480]   - All right, what's your third theory, Mitch?
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.240]   - Oh, the third theory is that the timing is good.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.120]   In fact, and you know, Danny has written about this at length.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.960]   Google's been kind of faltering a bit.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.480]   You know, after Google Wave and after Google Buzz
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.520]   and all these other things that they've tried
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.200]   and failed to get into the market,
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   it's a good time for changing the guard.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.520]   But I think that's kind of lower down
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.600]   than the other two things.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.640]   - I think he's a little injured by this past year
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.240]   of kind of missteps and miscues,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.720]   weird things that he's said about, you know,
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.280]   with the creep or creepy line,
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.600]   go right up to the creepy line, but not across it.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.680]   Things like that kind of helped his reputation
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.280]   with Larry and Sergey.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.560]   Of course, Larry has said a few stupid things do.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.240]   Like we wanna be your brain.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.240]   - Yes. - That's a long time ago.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.080]   - So he doesn't say that anymore?
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.240]   - Well, he hasn't spoken.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.760]   He hasn't spoken of the three of them.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.400]   He's spoken the least recently.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.640]   And that's been kind of my theory is both the timing
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.440]   and you know, Eric just kind of being sick of it.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.040]   I mean, he has had to be the public face now for 10 years.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   This past year has not been a happy time for him
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.400]   in that, you know, he says something and sometimes--
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.720]   - Misinterive. - Sometimes it has been taken
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.560]   out of context.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.400]   Sometimes it's like, you just shouldn't have said that
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.560]   because it sounds dumb no matter how you say it.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.080]   At other times-- - But maybe that's a sign
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.920]   of his fatigue.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.440]   Maybe that's a sign of he's kind of letting his guard down
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.200]   so it doesn't, it doesn't care as much anymore.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.480]   - And I thought, Ken O'Lenna had a piece, you know,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.120]   he'd spent a lot of time there to write his book on Google
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.160]   and he was in contact with someone who said
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.160]   that that seemed to be the case that Eric was feeling
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.880]   kind of down and tired and, you know,
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   thought he could get re-energized and really couldn't do it.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.600]   So it just seemed like a good time to kind of check out
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.840]   and bring somebody in fresh, even though Larry isn't necessarily
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.280]   fresh, but at least if Larry has to start stepping up
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.760]   into the CEO space now and he goes on to some show,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.560]   the first thing they're gonna ask him isn't,
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.000]   so you said this, this, this, this,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.280]   did you really mean all that?
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.080]   He kind of loses some of that baggage.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.800]   The things people are gonna start asking him is,
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.880]   so you're the new CEO, what are you gonna be doing
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.280]   or what's going forward with Google
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.720]   and it kind of changes the conversation I think a bit.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.240]   Is it a, okay, so the stock market reacted to Steve Jobs
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.480]   stepping down by killing Apple's stock price significantly.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.080]   They reacted to Eric Schmidt stepping up
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.880]   by bumping the Google stock price significantly.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.840]   Is the stock market right?
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.080]   Is this good for Google?
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.480]   (loud rumbling)
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.840]   Stock market's never wrong.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   - I find it difficult to say anything about stock markets
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.280]   'cause I usually find most investors seem to be idiots
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.920]   and don't understand anything about the companies that they buy.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.960]   And I, you know, it's hard for me to tell you
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.560]   whether this is good or bad for Google because-
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.400]   - You know what it tells you though?
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.760]   - Even though I think as much time watched,
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.040]   there's so many pieces to them.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   - Right, it tells you what the conventional wisdom is,
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.080]   which is that Steve Jobs integral to the success of Apple
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.200]   and I think that that's actually probably true
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.040]   and that Eric Schmidt is far from integral
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.520]   and perhaps even a hindrance to the success of Google.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.340]   Is that true?
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.880]   - I think that's very well said.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.040]   I mean, you know, if Eric Schmidt were to leave Google
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   tomorrow, if he had said, I'm quitting, goodbye.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.280]   I've just, you know, I wanna take that job,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.680]   New York Post is right.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.680]   (laughing)
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.320]   - I have this TV job.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.000]   I have this TV job.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.080]   Oprah's calling.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   - Google would not, I think, noticeably have a problem.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.500]   You know, maybe Larry and Sergey might decide they need
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.920]   to have another person to kind of keep them focused,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.600]   which seems to be the main thing that he's done
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.920]   based on reports is say, hey, Larry, Sergey,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.120]   look over here again.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.040]   - That was his tweet.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.880]   That was his tweet.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.360]   His adult supervision no longer necessary.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.920]   - But, you know, to where Steve Jobs really comes across
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   as this visionary genius who really puts a lot of him
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.560]   in product, like, is it, like, is that, is that,
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.800]   is that who Larry Page is?
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.000]   Is that who Sergey Brin is?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.240]   Is there somebody at Google who is an analog to that?
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.880]   I mean, I've remember, I've taught, you know,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.200]   in the early days, 10 years ago before Eric,
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.320]   I remember, you know, talking with Larry and Sergey
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.440]   when it was a smaller company,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.280]   they were much more available,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.200]   and really having great conversations with Sergey
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.600]   about the search results.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.360]   And he was, I mean, they're really into the technology.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.440]   In some ways I think they--
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.520]   - No, I heard that, but I think what Google,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.720]   it's hard to say.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.520]   I think what Google has instead of that
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.040]   is this belief in testing and analytics.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.520]   So rather than Steve Jobs perhaps having an intuition
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.720]   and thinking, I am so right that I'm going to do this
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   and I will bring people into a new space,
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.880]   I think Google tends to launch a product
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.400]   and then watch what people do and then reshape it
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.880]   based on that kind of feedback to decide
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.800]   and do a lot of testing before they do it.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.000]   So, you know, their muse is analytics, I suppose,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.840]   in some ways, but it's hard to say,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.120]   but I can't recall many stories where it's come out that,
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.440]   wow, Larry really shaped it this way,
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.040]   or Sergey really shaped it that way,
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.960]   or it was Eric's vision that made this sort of thing happen.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.760]   On a product level, occasionally you have
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.720]   individual product people who seem to have a vision.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.120]   Wave was an example of that.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.840]   You had a team that seemed to have a vision
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.240]   of what it was supposed to be,
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.320]   and it really was something different that wasn't out there.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.320]   You know, you have individual products in that way,
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.320]   but not like an Uber product controller, I would say.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.880]   - Well, let's not forget what Eric said
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.320]   was the justification for this,
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.600]   that they had three people participating in every decision
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.520]   and that made the company not nimble and agile enough,
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.240]   so therefore they had to have a division of labor.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.080]   - Right.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.000]   - That it was in fact, there were too many people.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.840]   - Yeah.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.080]   - Although they said we're still gonna have three people,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.720]   so it's like, who's the third?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.960]   Who's the third now?
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.160]   We're all still hanging out and boop buddies and you know.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.720]   - Who's the third?
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.160]   - Well, Eric.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.480]   - Oh, so yeah.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.040]   - Yeah, he was, you know, one of the things he said,
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.400]   well, we're still all working together,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.640]   we're still gonna be making these decisions and whatnot,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.760]   so I mean, that felt more like an excuse to me
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.680]   than anything, but underneath it,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.960]   I thought the thing that perhaps was more notable
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   was that previously Larry was president of technology.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.440]   I remember correctly, and Sergey was president products,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.880]   or they might have been flip-flopped.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.240]   I'll search for it in a second.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.000]   But with this change, those titles went away,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.680]   so Eric's been stepping up into this new thing
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.640]   that he's doing, which seems to be,
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.760]   I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna get a glad hand
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.640]   and be nice to all the business people
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.040]   I need to make the deals with,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.760]   but I don't necessarily have to go on CNNBC anymore.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.840]   - Oh, that's interesting, yeah.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.240]   - And Larry seemed to be like, all right,
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.680]   I'm gonna be doing that role going forward,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.240]   get it, you don't wanna be dealing with it,
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.480]   I'll pick that up, and I'm also gonna take a firm hand
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   on all of our existing products.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.920]   And Sergey, your job now is blue sky.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.440]   You are supposed to be figuring out
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.480]   where the hell our startup culture went,
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.080]   and how do we start having products internally
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.040]   that are emerging instead of all these products now
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.360]   that we're either having to build by,
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.280]   or we're seeing people who used to work for Google,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.520]   go off and build them outside of Google.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.760]   'Cause they said he's in part of strategic products
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.920]   and everything else.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   So to me, that was the main restructuring,
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.200]   I thought that was going on with Google,
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.720]   almost felt like they're saying,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.440]   we're gonna build the garage again at one point,
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.560]   and Sergey's gonna take control of that.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.920]   And Larry will make sure that the house is staying
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.800]   in order that we're already living in.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.560]   Maybe.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.160]   - Well, that sounds business as usual.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.560]   I feel like Eric's not gonna be around that long.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.920]   I mean, I think they made a lot of effort
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.240]   to imply that, to reassure people,
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.800]   I just feel like, you know, TV show or not,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.760]   I don't think he's gonna be around that much longer.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.360]   - Yeah, that $100 million bonus points to,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.680]   you give somebody, it points to the idea that he was,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.720]   he had a foot out the door
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.440]   and they wanna drag him back in.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.400]   - That he was ready to leave.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.480]   - Yeah.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.720]   - Well, the 100 million to me says,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.760]   let's just give him this thing
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.000]   and we'll put this vesting in there.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.800]   Maybe that'll make some of the investor things
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.400]   that believe that he's gonna fly around.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.600]   - That's what I feel like all this is.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.280]   - Even though it's nothing money to him, right?
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.080]   - Well, it sounds like, you know,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.480]   Google wants him to stick around, right?
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.880]   And that they're just giving him incentive to do so.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.560]   So it makes it sound like it's maybe more
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.080]   his decisions to step away.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.780]   Or maybe that he does have a foot out the door.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.360]   He has been thinking about that.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.840]   Just, it seems like a symbolic move,
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.240]   like, hey, we really want you to stick around
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.560]   and this is why the vesting is built in.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.160]   It's very common for companies to do this,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.280]   even small startups,
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.840]   vesting equity over time is a way to hold the talent.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.160]   You never give people the award all at once.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.000]   - Right.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.400]   - If you want them to stick around.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.240]   So in other words, it's not a goodbye gift,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.680]   it's a stick around gift.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.160]   - It's a, we want you to stick around gift.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.840]   Which I think is an interesting,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.900]   interesting move, public move by Google, you know, gesture.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:35.480]   - All right, let's see here, what else?
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.720]   I actually tell you what, let's take a break
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.200]   'cause there is a lot more to talk about.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   We're running short of time,
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.680]   we've got a great panel here, Gina Trapani,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.240]   from smarterware.org and lifehacker.com
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.360]   and think up.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.200]   - Think up?
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.600]   - And I'm gonna, we'll talk about it later.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.240]   - Okay, cool. - A cool new thing.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.360]   - Cool. - A cool new thing.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.440]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.560]   And also with us, Danny Sullivan of searchengineland.com.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.920]   A guy has been watching search engines
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.240]   for as long as they've been search engines.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.080]   Is that about right?
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.040]   When did you start doing that?
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.960]   - '96.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.280]   - Oh, good Lord.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.840]   Back at the end, we had to walk to Vista days.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.000]   That's pre-Google.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   We walked through the snow and mailed our queries
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.160]   to Altavista.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.200]   - Because it was Altavista, it was Yahoo.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.760]   Google wasn't there in '96.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.680]   - No, it was-- - Was there lights?
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.280]   - Northern lights.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.320]   - Nobody that's allowed alive now was alive then.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.960]   It's amazing, actually.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.800]   So yeah.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.760]   - What an interesting beat to cover something
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.680]   that is 100% changed.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.760]   - Totally upended.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.560]   - It's fun.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.400]   - Yeah.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.240]   Well, that's what I like.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.680]   - I keep being tough to work one day, say,
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.720]   "Oh, it's not gonna be anything more going on."
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.560]   It's all done.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.720]   - That's why I love it.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.520]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.400]   Also with this Mitch Wagner,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.760]   a fellow Sandy Egan from the CMO site.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.600]   - Yes.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.760]   - I'm glad to have all three of you on today
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.400]   and we'll continue on in just a moment.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.880]   And I'll tell you what, normally Jeff was not here.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.360]   Jeff's at Davos and the Germans wouldn't allow him to speak
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.240]   because they knew it was a Google show.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.080]   So they've blurred his voice.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:09.920]   - Blur me.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.760]   - Blur me.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.600]   Blur me.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.440]   Blur me.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.600]   - But he normally does a number of the week.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.560]   So I'm gonna give Mitch and Danny a chance.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.120]   You have a few minutes while I do this ad
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.080]   and then we'll get to the kick and the number and so on.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.720]   To come up with a number that you think
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.320]   is a reflects something, a trend in the news this week.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.160]   - Number.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.000]   - Number.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.280]   I'll let you search while I talk a little bit about hover.com.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   Domain registration done right.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.080]   I was so happy when I was doing it wrong.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.000]   Actually, hover is not something new.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.120]   You remember Domaine's direct?
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.320]   They've been doing this for a long time, part of two cows.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.640]   They've renamed and rebranded
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.400]   because they realized there was something missing
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.800]   in the domain registrars out there.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.400]   They all looked like a carnival site.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.760]   They all looked like dancing chickens
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.480]   and 18 clicks before you could even buy something.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.000]   And Hover said, you know, it really should be easy.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.200]   It's not a complicated thing.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.800]   So they've created, if you go to twig.cover.com,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.840]   you'll see how clean, simple and easy it is.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.560]   You couldn't get simpler than this.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.600]   Search for a domain, transfer a domain.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.160]   They don't do hosting.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.760]   So they're not gonna upsell you on their hosting.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.480]   They do just a few things.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.680]   You can either have your domain forwarded,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.560]   which is what most people think of as domain hosting.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.760]   You know, I have leoville.com.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.560]   The registrar doesn't host it.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.640]   I have professional hosting service.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.160]   They'll also do email forwarding for you.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.200]   So you can have a domain registered with them.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.480]   And this is a good idea,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.800]   even if you're not gonna put up a website,
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:45.720]   get your own domain, a family name or,
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.680]   it's such a great thing.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.640]   'Cause then with the forwarding,
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   you can use Gmail or Hotmail, whatever the heck you like,
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.960]   or your ISP's mail,
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.000]   but you can change around your email address,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.040]   never changes, it's always, you know,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.960]   leoville.com and has been for 20 years.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.400]   So that's a, if nothing else, a good reason to do this,
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.400]   you can have custom URLs as well.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.920]   And it's very affordable.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.280]   Plus, there's not the upsell.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.120]   For instance, you know, those other guys,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.400]   well, they'll sell you a privacy.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.320]   They say, well, you got the domain,
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.840]   but you don't want anybody to know where you are.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.880]   So do would you like to buy domain privacy?
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.280]   It's, oops, I went to the wrong side.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.840]   It's free on hover.com.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.880]   It's included, it's automatic domain.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.280]   Of course you don't want anybody to know your information.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.520]   Go to twig.hover.com, you'll save 10% off your new domain.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.760]   With a twig offer code, 25,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.400]   if you've got a bunch of domains to transfer,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.240]   I wish I'd done this.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.360]   I thought, oh, I'll do it by hand.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.600]   What an idiot.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.200]   If you have a bunch of domains to transfer,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.280]   just spend the $25 and they'll transfer them all,
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.840]   which is really great.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.480]   Transfers are free, they will charge you $10
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.400]   for the domain transfer, which is applied
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.200]   to your next year of registry.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.560]   So in effect, you're gonna get an extra year
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.000]   of registry for $10 when you transfer your name over.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.920]   That's a good deal.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.600]   Twig.hover.com, use the offer code.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.240]   Twig and you'll save another 10% on top of that.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.400]   We thank them for their support.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.800]   Let's start with the, well, can we do a quick,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   we'll do a quick news right now,
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.160]   'cause there's so many other stories.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.360]   I almost hate to leave any of these out,
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.680]   but we're running out of time.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.880]   Android 3 platform preview and SDK tools.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   Have you looked at this, Gina?
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.840]   Have you, I know you're a developer.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.920]   - I haven't had a chance to install the new SDK yet,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.400]   but Life Hacker just posted a screenshot tour
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.040]   of what's in the SDK now.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   So this is a preview of Android 3.0, which is Honeycomb.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.600]   No due date yet, it's a preview,
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.000]   so it's still unstable, things might change,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.920]   but it's Android built specifically for larger screens,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.680]   so tablets, essentially.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.400]   So if you hit Life Hacker right now
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.880]   and click on some of those images,
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.800]   you can see that there's a new theme,
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.920]   I think they described as a holographic theme.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.520]   It looks really pretty in it.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.440]   - It looks pretty, it looks.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.160]   - Yeah, yeah, it looks really pretty
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.560]   and optimized for big screens, tablet screens,
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.480]   but we'll also be running on the smaller handsets.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   So I'm super excited.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.520]   - So we'll get this on our Android phones?
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.600]   - Yeah, I mean, they're not forking Android
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.120]   in the sense that there would be a tablet Android
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.160]   and then a handset Android.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   Like Honeycomb will be for all screen revolutions and sizes.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.320]   - Okay.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.960]   - Yeah, so eventually when it does roll out,
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.080]   everyone will get it.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.040]   There'll just be support for larger screen resolutions.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.440]   So it's looking really, really good.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.040]   And I think there's gonna be some serious
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.600]   Honeycomb, hot Honeycomb action at Google I/O,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.520]   which will be in, I think it's in May,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.080]   but registration opens up in February.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.200]   - And we're gonna do that, you suggested
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.440]   I think we will do this, you're gonna be there, I know.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.600]   - I will be there, if I can get registered in time
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.440]   'cause registration's go fast, but yeah.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.400]   - I'm just sure I know.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.920]   - So we'll get, we wanna do the show from there.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.240]   I'm sure we can get some help from somebody at Google.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.560]   Hand, hand.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.840]   - Yeah, I bet we could probably get
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.080]   because I'd love to do the show from there.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.640]   We covered it, we covered it.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.120]   They had last year, they had two keynotes.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.640]   And the first one was good, but the second one
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.600]   was where all the juice was, and we need to cover both
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.200]   of those and then do a show from there.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.240]   So we'll do that in May.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.520]   - That'll be awesome, that'll be awesome.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.920]   But I bet there'll be a lot of Honeycomb
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.400]   going on at I/O.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.880]   - I'm looking at the Life Hacker article,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.000]   and all the attention goes to the eye candy.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.320]   But there's some things that is more than eye cameras,
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.400]   this is called the action bar.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.520]   - If you click on that image, you can enlarge it.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.680]   - Okay, we'll get more details here.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.520]   - Yeah.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.840]   - So this is in every application,
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   there's some context sensitive buttons here.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.400]   And this is a complete redesign.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.160]   Look, there's the trash, I mean.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.840]   - Yes, it's totally different.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.840]   - This is refreshed.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.400]   So this will be consistent across the board.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.680]   - It looks that way.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.920]   It looks that way.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.480]   - In every application, the top?
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.320]   - It's a Gmail app.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   - Yeah, it looks like a Gmail app.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.160]   - Yeah.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.000]   - Nice.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.680]   - Yeah, a tablet optimized Gmail.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.120]   - So there's two bars, they say,
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.960]   there's a new message button, a refresh button at the top.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.880]   When you select a message, the action bar changes
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.960]   to display a move to folder button.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.040]   So in other words, this bar here is gonna be context sensitive,
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.280]   the second row down here, depending on what you're up to.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.240]   - Which is huge, right?
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.840]   Because normally when you're developing an Android app,
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   and I've learned this firsthand in the last couple of weeks,
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.760]   you have to bury all this functionality in the menu, right?
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.720]   So you're asking users to tap the menu.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   - It's hard to find too, they don't know.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.400]   - It's hard to find, right?
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.000]   So if you have this concept context sensitive menu bar,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.200]   which a lot of apps build in,
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.640]   sees Mac builds in, a lot of the good apps actually build one in,
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.120]   but it'd be nice to have it as part of the development process.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.520]   Like, hey, you're gonna have this menu bar
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.320]   and buttons are gonna change, depending on your context.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.840]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.240]   The keyboard looks good, copy and paste looks good.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.240]   - This is cool.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.320]   - Yeah, it's good good stuff.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.600]   - Yeah, it's a much, it looks like a much larger,
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.000]   this would be great on a tablet, that big keyboard.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:50.840]   - Yep.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.240]   - And the copy and paste is already in Gingerbread,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.360]   this is that new, those new sliders.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.680]   You haven't seen that on your Nexus One,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.920]   but we have that on the Nexus S.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.240]   - Aw.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.680]   - Twist it nicely, I'll twist it.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.200]   - We had heard a rumor that you'd have to have
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.920]   a dual core processor, but now they're saying,
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.240]   no, no, no, that's just what we'd like you to have,
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.800]   but it's not required, right?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.000]   - Ooh, yes.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.520]   - 'Cause otherwise, it would leave every phone
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.440]   in the market out.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.840]   - No, right.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.440]   - That would be good.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.760]   Although the fact that they have--
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.600]   - It runs on a, a generic phones.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.960]   - The fact that they haven't updated the Nexus One
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.720]   to Gingerbread is a little concerning,
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.040]   like maybe they feel like,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.520]   hey, once it's a year old, you got what you got.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.920]   - Oh, this week I got a notification about an update
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.560]   and it was Android two, two, three.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.400]   - It's two, two, three.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.520]   - Two, two, three. - Yeah.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.800]   - And I just had that moment of like, yes, no.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.040]   (laughs)
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.240]   But I don't know, they said that next couple of weeks
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.160]   back in early December, so I'm hanging in,
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.000]   hanging in there.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.440]   - They haven't said no.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.680]   - They haven't said no, they haven't said no.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.880]   You can now port your home number or whatever
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.000]   to Google Voice, I like that, $20, I don't like that,
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.520]   but that's nice if you have a number you wanna keep
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.960]   and you wanna use Google Voice,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.400]   I think everybody should use Google Voice.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.000]   Is there any negative to Google Voice,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.480]   any of you guys feel that would make anybody
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.360]   wanna stop before they port their main line to it?
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.040]   - Well, you can't port your main line on your mobile number.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.240]   So if you have a line line that you can't move that over yet.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.680]   - Just your mobile numbers.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.800]   - And I actually ported my mobile number over,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.040]   they let me test it out for the past six months.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.600]   So I moved it over and I did a write up yesterday about it.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.480]   Probably the chief negative is a couple people feel like
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.520]   sometimes the quality of Google Voice,
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.320]   'cause you're going through their network, doesn't hold up.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.520]   I can't tell, I can't tell sometimes whether it's Google Voice
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.600]   or just AT&T or Verizon.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.120]   - So if I port, Danny, if I port my iPhone phone number
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.160]   to Google Voice, does that mean all my calls now
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.120]   have to go through Google Voice?
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.240]   - They'll be routed through that, yeah.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.280]   - Every call.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.920]   If somebody calls your number, it will go through Google Voice
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.800]   and you'll be talking to the Google Voice network
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.880]   as it gets to your iPhone.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.040]   - Oh, that is a negative.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.480]   - If you call out, you can choose to use, if you will,
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.760]   your real number on the iPhone
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   or then you just go pure AT&T or you can use Google Voice.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.640]   - So you do have on outbound calls, you have the choice.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.480]   It's only the when people call, but that's the case
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.960]   for how many calls my Google Voice number,
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.320]   they're calling me on Google Voice.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.160]   - Yeah, right.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.000]   - Right.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.600]   - For the most part, I've loved it.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.200]   I mean, it's just the freedom and it's my number plus.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   At one point, I had four different mobile phones
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.400]   I was testing, so it was great that I could just,
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.800]   I felt like I could accessorize.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.800]   I'm gonna go out rollerblading, I'm gonna take the iPhone
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.920]   'cause it has the flip case.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.360]   No, I'm going off here and I gotta walk around,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.840]   I've got the Samsung fascinating, it's very light.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.000]   So it'll go in my pocket.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.760]   You know, some days, all of us will have to go.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.160]   I'll take the broil too.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.680]   But it made it very easy to know that any phone I took,
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.640]   I would have my phone number go to it.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.160]   That was wonderful, although, you know,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.520]   all people were not carrying four different phones.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.880]   - No, but it's like what I was talking about
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.120]   with the email, having a personal email address
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.200]   and then having it forward.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.520]   It's the same idea.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   Ultimately, in the future, we should all have one phone number.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.760]   Maybe we should just have one thing.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.320]   And then if an email gets sent to it, it's email,
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.680]   if it's a phone call, it's a phone call, if it's text,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.280]   really ultimately, you shouldn't we just all have one number?
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.120]   That's it?
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.720]   - I have two items on my wish list
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.440]   for Google Voice and I'm hoping Google listens to this
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.520]   so they'll do it.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.520]   One of them is I think you actually need more than one number.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.360]   You need different numbers for your different roles in life.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.160]   I want to give one number to my friends and family
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   and another number to people I work with.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.520]   - That makes sense.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.360]   - So, you know what?
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.960]   - I mean, I do that kind of 'cause I use contact groups
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.360]   so that when my wife calls, it says,
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.800]   "Hi, honey, sorry I missed you, love you."
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.760]   And she says, "Do you tell everybody who calls you
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.280]   and leaves a message that you love them?"
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.400]   'Cause she doesn't really understand that,
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.440]   no, no, it's just for you.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.040]   And then if a business associate calls
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.840]   and there's different responses
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.920]   and then if it's a number, I don't know,
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.760]   that's a third response.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.880]   - I'm gonna call you Google Voice number.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.400]   I wanna know what my message is.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.560]   - Yeah, you know where you stand on the ranking
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.040]   depending on my message.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.080]   I don't know you, I don't wanna talk to you.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.440]   - Am I in ranks or coworkers?
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.120]   - I've always wanted Darth Vader music as my theme song.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:08.960]   - Um, um.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.800]   - Yep, I'll just--
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.640]   - I'll never go in a room.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.720]   - Um, um.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.760]   - I thought Karina Biorana would be good maybe.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.520]   - Oh, it's like you're calling Satan.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.720]   - The other thing I want from Google Voice
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.400]   is true desktop VoIP app.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.280]   'Cause right now I patch it through to Gizmo
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   or I patch it through to Sky
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.760]   and they kill it for a couple of years
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.400]   before they bring it back.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.880]   This is by the way, Gina, if you call,
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.280]   this is your ringtone.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   (audience cheering)
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:54.040]   - Just testing, just--
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.120]   - This is acceptable.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.560]   (laughing)
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.320]   - It's the dark fury online for.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.760]   The seventh rider of the apocalypse.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.520]   All right, let's, okay, that's a good story.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.440]   So no reason not to port.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.720]   Go for it, man.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.240]   - Love Google Voice.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.160]   - Love Google Voice.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.080]   Google buys a company called Say Now.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.560]   This is to bolster their voice service.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.560]   What is Say Now?
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.240]   - What is Say Now?
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.080]   - No idea.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.400]   - Don't tell it.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.480]   - Say Now, Say Now.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.320]   - It's a song.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.160]   - It's confusing.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.840]   It seems to be something where you call celebrities
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.120]   and leave messages for them and then they--
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.960]   - A pin in a fool.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.400]   - The messages back or something like that.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.720]   It sounds like some sort of stalker enablement service.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.560]   Just--
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.520]   - It may be just--
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.080]   - Hang around David Letterman's house.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.480]   - Yeah, you could call Fiddy Said or Trisha Yearwood.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.600]   Gee, decisions, decisions.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.000]   Or the Jonas Brothers, fans call and leave a message
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.400]   and the stars can then quote, "call back."
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.520]   But see, now obviously they don't intend to apply it.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.280]   I mean, I think Google would say,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.480]   well instead of stars, what if this is you?
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.360]   Right, celebrities can connect with their fans.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.840]   No, this must be, they have no use for this.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.720]   This must be Dane Cook uses it.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.400]   (laughing)
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.600]   - Oh, I'm still there.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.920]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah, I could call Dane Cook.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.000]   Wow, here's a Dane Cook.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.680]   This is a call, Dane.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.080]   No, no, that's not Dane.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.560]   (laughing)
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   - I am live right now from my desk in,
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.720]   I'm never desk in a lot of like,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.320]   I'm just saying the work I'm recommending, I guess.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.800]   - Can't get the carmin of your end up,
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.880]   but it's somehow suited.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.480]   - Put my head down on a book that I'm pretending to read
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   and drooling and, so I'm at my workplace.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.040]   No, I don't like that either.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.240]   That sounds like a person that's about to go home and fuck.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.080]   - This is the end times, actually.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.400]   (laughing)
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.040]   - So this is like, voice publishing.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.560]   This is like YouTube, but for voice.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.520]   - I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.000]   I think that Google could do something with this.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.880]   Not with Dane Cook, obviously.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.240]   - Yeah, who doesn't know?
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.280]   - What about, because they couldn't get Groupon,
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.320]   all the rumors are they're gonna do a Groupon clone
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.800]   as some sort of coupon thing.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.200]   - Oh yeah, it's coming.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.720]   - You're kind of. - They're gonna do it.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.040]   People are finding Google coupons
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.280]   and getting that confused with Google Groupons,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.000]   which aren't Google Groupons,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.480]   they'll be called Google offers.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.120]   - They're coupons from Google.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:26.960]   Isn't that a coupon?
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.800]   - That's a coupon to it, doesn't it?
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.640]   That would be Groupons.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.480]   - Groupons.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.600]   - Groupons.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.680]   - But, Groupon.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.520]   - That confused that.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.360]   - That would be a good one.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.120]   - That would be great.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.280]   But yeah, they're gonna do it.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.600]   And man, it's like, okay, if you don't want our six billion
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.880]   dollars, we'll sink it into something else.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.080]   - So it's called Google offers,
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.520]   it looks and operates like Groupon, or LivingSocial.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.040]   You get an email with a local deal of the day.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040]   You could buy it.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.840]   It's the same business.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.680]   I guess it's--
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.360]   - Who's to say Google's gonna be able to execute?
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.800]   - Last week, when at LivingSocial,
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.280]   they were selling those Amazon gift cards,
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.920]   $10 for $20 card.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.840]   - Right, right.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.680]   - That's huge.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.520]   - That's huge.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520]   - I mean, Google was gonna put six billion into Groupon,
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.240]   I suppose that that could give them a lot of money to--
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.920]   - This is the true cost of that,
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.760]   somebody wrote an article
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.080]   and I would like to give them credit, but I can't.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.560]   But the real cost of this is Salesforce on the ground.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.400]   - Yeah.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.200]   - Because both these companies have to put,
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.680]   you know, it's aggressively local.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.600]   You've gotta have a salesperson in every single market,
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.120]   at least.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.320]   So this is a huge cost.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.480]   You're talking thousands of new employees.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.920]   - Yeah, and Google has never had a strength
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.840]   as a hands-on people-to-people company.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.680]   - Oh yeah.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.960]   - Maybe they could do the,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.080]   some sort of Python Salesforce.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.760]   Did you see the open world state of the web?
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.600]   - Yes.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.440]   - I know where-- - Love it.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.040]   - But their Groupon--
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:42.880]   - Love it.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.400]   - Consume.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.480]   Where it says a Groupon got young people excited about,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.280]   about coupons again, it was just hilarious.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.880]   It was one of my favorite parts of that whole comic.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.360]   - Pulling it up right now, let me,
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.880]   this is the state of the web right now.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.720]   If you go to, oh, let's see,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.040]   oh, I gotta find the link.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.640]   - Theopemel.com/comics/state.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.440]   - Underscore web, underscore winter.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.800]   Give me the Google theopemel, stay of the web.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.640]   - No problem. - I did,
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.720]   and I unfortunately I got to--
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.160]   - I black-o-did, and it didn't find me.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.520]   - I got to man, I got to black-o-game-y demand media, yeah.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.800]   It gave me the Oscar results string to me.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.640]   - Well, I'm always thinking by the way,
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.160]   black-o has created a,
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.880]   they have created a slash type of block that out.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.720]   - Oh good.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.560]   - State of the web.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.400]   - Oh, here we are.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.560]   - Here it is, theopemel, state of the web.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.240]   Facebook is now used by one in 13 people on earth.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   Lord Zuckabees demands more.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.080]   That's good, I like that.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.080]   - He's got moves.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.560]   - He's got some, I don't know what that is.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.320]   It looks like a happy fit, it looks like a happy fit.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.720]   Every once in a while, Facebook makes all 500 million
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.960]   of these people switch to a new layout.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.320]   - Oh my God, there's new layouts in outrage,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.720]   I can't believe it 15 minutes later.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.240]   Oh hey, you're using the new Facebook layout,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.360]   how do you like it?
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.160]   - Eh, eh. - Huh?
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.920]   Verizon plus iPhone.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.760]   There goes the one reason everyone ever signed up for AT&T.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.200]   - Oh, don't say.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.720]   - This is, when I saw this one, Gina, I cried for you.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.560]   - Just give that one.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.480]   - I can't make it for you.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.320]   - Let's give that one.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.800]   - Yeah, who almost buries delicious,
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.840]   but apparently the internet is still using it.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.200]   Dear Yahoo, if you sell delicious,
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.160]   please sell it to someone who won't build a competing service
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.400]   within the same company.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.520]   Yahoo, bookmarks. - Apple bookmarks.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.440]   - Apple watches Ping, a social networking
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   and music recommendation service,
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.560]   which subsequently takes over the music industry.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.160]   - Ha, just kidding, no one's using that crap.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.000]   (laughs)
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.080]   By the way, made this tumbler goes down page for tumbler.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:34.920]   - I love that.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.360]   - The tumbler is great graphic.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.200]   - And they used it. - And they used it.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.520]   - Let's do the audio and look this up
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520]   'cause it's a really cool image.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   - They used it, it's so cool.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.360]   That's neat.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.520]   - They got a favorite though.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.440]   - Groupon manages to make young people excited
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.680]   about coupons in 1910 and 2010.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.160]   Holy hamburgers, Martha, buy one shackle ground,
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.000]   beef and get a free aircraft carrier, ship cheese log.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.160]   - Sweet cheese, Bill.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.720]   - 2010 plus.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.520]   - Holy swine juice, Chrissy.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.600]   Get $200 worth of pork chop milkshakes for only $100.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.360]   - Jesus coupon cap in Christ, the savings, so incredible.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.200]   - Damn.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.720]   (laughs)
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.560]   - Love that. - You use those things.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.320]   You shouldn't mock Groupon users.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.520]   You gotta manicure for Manny Petty for 20% off.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.240]   - I'm not a big Groupon person.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.840]   I did find myself very excited about getting double points
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.960]   at the grocery store last week,
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.120]   and that's when I realized that I am truly in my mid 30s.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.760]   Like I'm running my call up now,
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.920]   or I'm excited about my club card.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.480]   - Next thing you know, you'll be listening to talk radio.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.280]   - I love the pork chop milkshakes though,
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.160]   because that just really encapsulates.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.720]   It's like this thing that you absolutely do not want.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.200]   - All right, let me sign up for Groupon.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.240]   Let's do pork chop milkshakes.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.080]   (laughs)
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.720]   - We can get him Manny Petty together, Leo.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   - Oh, let's see what today, $25 for $50 worth of tea.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.600]   It is, it's hipster at Sammothar.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.960]   It's hipsters.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.080]   - I went through weeks worth of Groupons that came to me,
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.200]   and it was just constantly eat, eat, workout,
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.360]   workout, eat, eat.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.200]   - Yeah.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.440]   - And get your hair done.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.600]   - They're basically what they go--
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.760]   - I would have time for all those things.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.240]   - They say what would Kevin Rose want right now?
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.720]   And then they put that on there.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.000]   - Was there a lot of hot air balloon rides
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.400]   and like paragliding,
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.480]   like all those kind of things that sound really exciting,
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.400]   but you never sort of get your act together to do?
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.720]   - How about a two night villa stay in breakfast
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.160]   for two at Sonoma Coast Villainspla in Bodega,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.120]   a 710 value yours for just 315?
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.360]   The fine print expires in one year,
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.840]   and the one per person reservation requires subject
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.680]   to availability.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   14 day cancellation is for current two.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.440]   (imitates gun firing)
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.160]   - Do not tat the fun ball.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.240]   (laughs)
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   - All right, let's see, we're doing,
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.240]   this is supposedly rushing through the stories,
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.120]   not so fast.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.080]   Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook page hacked, weird.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.280]   However, good news, Facebook is now offering SSL,
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.000]   we'll soon offer SSL throughout the site.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.920]   This is in response to fire sheep.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.560]   - Finally. - Finally.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.080]   - I keep telling Mark Nutt to use I am a sexy dude
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.680]   as a password. (laughs)
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.280]   - It's a huge one, listen.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.440]   - Mark Zuckerberg and I'm a sexy dude, dude.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.120]   All right, let's get to our tip,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.880]   and I hope you guys gave you time,
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.840]   have come up with some numbers
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.640]   and I have a fabulous new tool of the week,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.720]   but first Gina, Trapani, your tip of the week, dear.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.440]   - Tip of the week, this is a really good one,
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.560]   I'm excited about this.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.640]   New Gmail Labs feature, an unread icon,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.440]   unread message icon count.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.680]   So if you go into your Gmail account,
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.600]   you go into labs, you enable this new lab on your icon,
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.280]   on the Gmail icon, it will show the number of unread messages
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.880]   in your inbox, which is awesome,
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.880]   'cause it means you can pin the tab, say in Chrome
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.400]   and only show the fav icon,
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.600]   but also know how many new messages you have.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.440]   This feature has been in the better Gmail Firefox extension,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.800]   which I maintain. - Which I love, yeah.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.120]   - Yeah, which I maintain, and it's really cool,
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.760]   and actually a Gmail engineer emailed me and said,
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.040]   "Hey, what do you think should go in labs?"
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.160]   And I said, "Look at my extension,
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.560]   I think all these things should go in labs."
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.920]   And that was a while ago, but it finally happened.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.040]   So it's really cool that you don't have to install
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.400]   any extra add-ons or extensions to get this.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.160]   And it's just super useful to,
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.800]   not that I recommend monitoring your email box constantly,
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.880]   but it's a nice way to see how much mail you have
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.800]   without having to switch tabs or get any sort of toaster pop-up.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.640]   - This is good.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.600]   You go every few days or weeks and then look at what's in labs,
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.920]   'cause there's always new stuff, isn't there?
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   - There is always new stuff.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.880]   They tend to do a post on the official Gmail blog
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   about new labs. - Just read the blog.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.120]   - Oh yeah, I just keep on top of the blog,
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.760]   'cause Gmail is literally one of the things
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.400]   I spend most of my time in during the day,
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.000]   so that's something that's--
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.280]   - So I've turned it on, so now this is gonna appear
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.480]   where in the icon?
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.720]   - In the fav icon in the tab, so--
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.640]   - Oh, that's cool, so I could just kind of go
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.840]   to another tab, but then I will see how many messages
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.920]   I have managed to ignore in the--
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.880]   - So if you-- - Uh oh, it's loading.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.960]   - Yeah, you know how many tens of thousands
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.520]   that number's gonna be counting--
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.440]   - Are you actually really gonna stretch the--
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.480]   - Counting, counting.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   (laughing)
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.640]   - Checking, counting, counting.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.880]   - It's going, eh, eh, eh, I can't lift it,
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.320]   it's too big a number.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.160]   - It's gonna be wider than the fav icon.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.880]   - We're gonna need more tabs.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.320]   (laughing)
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   - All right, thank you.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.760]   - There's multiple people who have less than 10,000 messages
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.840]   in their priority inbox, it's very, very--
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.680]   - It's still counting!
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.520]   - Counting!
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.360]   - No judgment.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.200]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.040]   Is it still counting?
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:22.880]   - It's still counting.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.720]   - It's still counting?
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.040]   - That's nuts.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.760]   It looked, the spinner even gave up.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.920]   - The spinner's like--
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.080]   - The spinner's like, I can't, I can't do this.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.120]   - And you know, I'm--
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120]   (laughing)
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:34.960]   - I need to get some--
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.160]   - It's gonna show up like, there is no number that word.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.000]   - It's just--
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   - It's gonna say Google.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.080]   - It's gonna say like, a lot.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.920]   - It's gonna say you have a Google messages
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.440]   and you're a Google inbox.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.760]   (laughing)
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.560]   - All right, well that's a good tip, I like that.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.400]   I like that.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.240]   - Thanks.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.040]   - Now, who have among you, the two of you, Danny and Mitch,
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.920]   do you, either of you have you a number,
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.000]   should I start with Danny?
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.840]   - Oh, I have one number.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.600]   - Mitch has a number, he's gonna get you off the hook, Danny.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.760]   Yes, Mitch.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.960]   - Whoo, the number is, I'll tell you how I got the number
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.800]   because I'm so cool, I Google Facebook number
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.400]   and came up with a type magazine article
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.480]   that said mobile is gonna be the number one priority
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.280]   so that I went to the original Wall Street Journal article
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.360]   which said 200 million is the number.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.200]   - Wow.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.240]   - 200 million is the number of people who access Facebook
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.360]   on mobile devices every day.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.880]   - Every day?
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.720]   - Yes.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.200]   - Wow. - That's amazing.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.680]   - And it is amazing, that's quite amazing.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.160]   - The CTO Brett Taylor said that mobile is gonna be
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.600]   the top priority for Facebook development going forward
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.080]   and one of the things they're gonna be doing
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.840]   is trying to move to HTML5
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.040]   because right now they have to run seven different versions
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.880]   of the client.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   - Ay, yay, karaamba.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.040]   - Yeah.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.520]   So I am very awesome for having come up with that.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.920]   - Do you want to number, is that the 200 million?
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.760]   That's a great number.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.400]   And my tool of the week, I was looking around,
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.640]   I saw the Android marketplace and I said,
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.200]   what is this to do.text touch?
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.160]   And it turns out for mere two dollars,
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.360]   I can have Gina Trapani's first Android application.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.920]   Yay. - 80.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.120]   - What does it do?
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:09.960]   - Tap the button.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.000]   - This button? - Well, I'm gonna drop box.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.600]   - Oh, I gotta log in and drop box.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.360]   So it saves the, it saves, this is from Todo.text,
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.160]   which I've always loved, which is a text-based to-do list.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.480]   You could store it in drop box and then it'll load it in here.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.200]   We talked about it last week, but I just wanted to say,
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.640]   it's in the marketplace, yay Gina, congratulations.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.920]   - Yay, for Gina. - Thank you.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.760]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.560]   Actually, it was an experiment.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.680]   I wanted to test this hypothesis that no one buys apps
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.120]   on Android, so I offered, so if you go to the GitHub
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.960]   repository, download area, you can download the app for free,
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.200]   but it's for $2 in the market, and if for your two bucks
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.400]   you get auto updates and that kind of thing
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.680]   through the market, not thousands,
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.320]   but hundreds of people have bought the app.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.280]   So people buy stuff on Android, even though they don't
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.680]   probably don't buy as many apps as they do on iOS.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.920]   People do buy stuff in the market.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.880]   So I'm really excited, I want to thank everyone
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   who did buy the app.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.760]   There's lots of really cool updates coming, offline use,
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.640]   home-screen widget, location-based stuff.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.480]   It's gonna be really cool.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.640]   - And it's well worth $2.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.880]   I don't care that I can get it for free.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.000]   That was very easy.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.600]   It's great, I'll log into my drop box
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.120]   and I'm gonna have my to-do list on here.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.480]   - Thank you, I'm so excited to have your name
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.800]   in my Google Checkout orders inbox layout.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.640]   - Did you see it?
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.320]   - I did see it, I did see it.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.400]   I did, I saw it for just a couple of years ago,
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.240]   so thank you.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.960]   - Yeah, I just bought it.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.000]   - Awesome, thank you.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.920]   - So there you go, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.640]   that is our, this week in Google for this week.

[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.400]   I'm off on Macmania 11, where Steve Wozniak
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.720]   and I will attempt to cross Cape Horn
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.600]   with little more than a green laser and a prayer.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.800]   Actually, we're gonna go to Antarctica.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.080]   That's gonna be a lot of fun, I can't wait.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.920]   - Oh, cool.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   - Yeah. - Very cool.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.920]   - I've all, a report back.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920]   - We are gonna miss you.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.040]   - Well, I may be able to get on.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.240]   We'll see, you know, there's some question about
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.480]   maybe I could somehow get on, but we'll see.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.920]   - Make a vacation, enjoy.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.400]   - Enjoy, enjoy.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.240]   (laughing)
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.080]   - I love to what you gotta do.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.000]   - But Jeff will be back next weekend.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.520]   Jeff will be back next weekend.
