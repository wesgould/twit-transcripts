[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   And it's great to see you.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160]   Hey there. Star of hands-on photography and hands-on wellness.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   One of our favorite guys around the place. What a hidden picture.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   Look at that camera and the light. You're so great.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   It looks great.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   No more as long. No more as long. Yes, Skype is finally behaving itself. That's good.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   Yeah, it looks good. Man, you're like a celeb.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   You can be on NBC now.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   Sorry, I'm thinking you're comfortable. Yeah. I'm just like, dang.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   Better than most. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't look so good with a picture so sharp, but boy.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   Yes, some of us would prefer.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   Hands-on photography. I have my own worries.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   A lot of time trying to set all of this stuff up in there.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   He's a trained professional. He's a trained professional.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   Will you share all of that with us?
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   Or you want to be the best looking person on the network?
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   Yes. I would gladly share as part of my pick of the week.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   How about that? Oh, okay. Okay. Coming up.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   We'll stick around for that. It's the generous Mr. Ant. Yes.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   Also from her brand new house now with bookshelves.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   Stacey Hagan-Botham. Stacey on IOT. poor Stacy.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   We see what she has on them. Oh, no, it's too fuzzy.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   I want to see what she has on them. Oh, I like that.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   Yeah, you could just guess.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   I can tell you that these back here in the back are the Sandman comics.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   Oh.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   John Updike got some Don Quixote.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   Oh, fancy.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   Yeah, this is my -- and then how to not die in the woods.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   That's a good one.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   I have a book called just how to not die.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   Oh, that's good.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   In the woods or anything.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   You know, the woods are right by me, so I felt like I needed that.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   You should probably have that. Yeah. How to stay alive in the woods.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   That would be a bad one, actually. I think what it's called.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   Stacey Hagan-Botham is from Stacey on IOT.com,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   where she covers the Internet of Things.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   She also has a great free newsletter there and does events,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   not just in the Internet of Things, but on machine learning and other things.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   Do you have one coming up?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   I do.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   I have one not this coming Thursday, but -- or Tuesday, but next Tuesday,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   the 20 -- oh, gosh, I think it's the 28th.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   It's the 28th.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   It is the 28th, yes.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   Great.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   Nice.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   Internet of Things World?
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   No.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   Oh, don't go there.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   We're fixing that.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   It's broken.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   If you go to Stacey on IOT.com/connected, it's everything is connected.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160]   It's for product managers and people who are trying to build connected devices
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   to talk about what you need to do.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   Oh, this will be fun.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   You've got participants from Google Intel and Honeywell.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Wow, that's great.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   And June, your oven maker, I've got Lindsay.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   Oh.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   Oh.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   Oh.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   Folks from Allegian.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   I can't remember.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   This is going to be big.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   It's going to be fun.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   Do you do charge for these?
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   This one is free.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   We have sponsors.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   I should thank my sponsors, but they're my usual sponsors.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   They're right there.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   Works with bicilicon labs.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   Very.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   Very.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   And ALA networks.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   Yeah, so this is -- I'm really excited about this event.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   This is a -- yeah, I'm just really excited.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   It's just kind of a new business for you.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   This is great.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   Yes, it's great.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   Yeah, I'm really impressed.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   Very nice.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   So you get two round tables.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   Yeah, those are going to be crazy because with Hoppe, you could have 10 people "on stage."
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   And so I'm going to have like five leaders and then I'm going to have people -- I'll
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.000]   invite you up if you have questions and you can share your stories and talk to people.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   So I'm hoping people actually really have good conversations.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   Nice.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   That should be really fun.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   I don't want to -- I don't want to talk about it.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   All right.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   Do your thing.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   You don't want to talk about it.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   She says after the 10-minute plug is over.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   No, I just -- I want to work it.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   But it's not about me.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   Seriously.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   I'm going to make it about me in a few minutes.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   It is about him because guess what?
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   I'm going to make it about him.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   Happy birthday to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160]   We sent Jeff a little birthday gift.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   Actually, Carson gets credit for this.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   And poor Jeff got it yesterday and has not been able to eat it.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   Pull down the lower third so he can see it.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   Oh my God.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   It's a giant taco cake.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   Taco cake.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   It's bigger than I thought.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   Oh, I thought it was a coronavirus cake.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   It's huge.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   Oh, it's not a -- please.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   I'll show them out.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   Although they do use the same mold.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   [ Laughter ]
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   Same.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   It's -- I can't believe that Carson managed to find a taco cake.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   And from the best bakery in the region.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   Swiss chalet.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   Man.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   Morristown.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   Now, what kind of cake is in there, do we know?
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   Looks like chocolate.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   We're going to slice it right now.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   I sincerely hope, buddy, it's not taco.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   Looks like a cake, but it's actually a taco.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   [ Laughter ]
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   I'm going to slice off a little bit of it here.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   So, let's have a piece of that rona virus cake.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   Oh, man.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   Happy birthday, Jeff.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   Are you doing anything to celebrate besides this?
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   No, I'm just trying to avoid it and not be older.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   I know.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   You know, when we get past -- when you get past the Big 6.0.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   It's 6 layers.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160]   5 layers with -- yeah.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   Oh, you can take it.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   You're very welcome.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   Happy birthday, Jeff.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   Let me have a little bite now.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   Happy birthday.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   Carson says that's the smallest one they have.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   Oh, damn, it's good.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   Oh, that's good.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   Nice.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   Happy birthday.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   I think I'm going to have another bite.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   I was going to have one bite.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   Pretty soon he's going to have taco cake.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   It's great.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   Cheers to you, you'll have to be nervous.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   Ooh.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160]   Okay, now I'm feeling bad.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   Now I'm jealous.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   That's how you do it.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Heck, I had pie.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   You had pie.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   That's right.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   We used to -- I mean, this was a -- you know, I think a lot of
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   businesses, it's a tradition that people probably miss now that
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   they're working from home, where you have the birthday cake
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   and everybody gets around and eats it and sings.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   And that's good.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   Carson, good work.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   By the way, Carson has provided my lunch every day now.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160]   My taco bell inspired burritos.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   It's Carson got me the beans and the sauce and everything.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   The burrito didn't work so well.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   But quesadilla.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   Oh, yeah, good for quesadilla.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Just a bean, some cheese.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   I'm a little guac, a little hot sauce taco bell.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   I'm very happy now.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   Folks, I hope you're not listening to this.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   Take it away.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   Before dinner or before lunch.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   We're just me.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   We're just like --
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   We're just like --
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   We're just me.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   We're in the middle of the night.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   Yeah, let's go.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   I guarantee you at least half our audience has gotten out of bed
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   and patting their way down to the kitchen from all of Froo Loops.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   True, Loops.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   What would you prefer us have?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   No, I'm just like Froo Loops.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   I mean, when there's honey smacks or something else out there.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   Crunch.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   Cap and crunch.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   Cap and crunch would be good.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   She's got taste is what she's saying.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   Although, Cap and Crunch always like rips up the inside of your mouth.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   That's always -- you're like, "Ah, Cap and..."
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   All right, so I got a technology problem.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   I need help with the show here.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160]   Please do.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   Right?
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   This isn't a show for that.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   Oh.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   Nice try, Ant.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Maybe Ant could be our enforcer.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   He could be.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   Go ahead.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   Go ahead.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   My GA.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   My G-Home thing has gone on to pure Disney movies and it won't stop.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   You mean it's just showing Disney movies all the time?
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   All I've been doing is showing Disney movies.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   Oh, it's a Disney take?
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.160]   Sorry, I'm going to say it.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   Okay, Google, stop.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   Sorry.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   This isn't supported.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   And then it just keeps going.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160]   Okay, pull down from the top.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   Slide your finger down from the top.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   Is there anything you can do there?
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   It says routines, media, broadcast, view, rooms.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   Oh, you're in some sort of --
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   I'm in some hell.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   Oh, my God.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   I can't go.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   Stop.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   Sorry, but from the bottom.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   Yeah, from the bottom.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   And then change it to photo frame.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   This is so funny.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   It's like an endless promo for the Disney team.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   Swipe up from the bottom.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   Swipe up from the bottom, Jeff.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   Okay, now choose something else.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   Settings.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   I got that information point.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160]   I've got a plus, it and arrow with two little ears on it.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   I don't know what that is.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   I got a minus, I got a mute, and I got a --
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   It's settings.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   It's settings.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   There are no Disney setting.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   About device photo frame.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   Photo frame.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   Do photo frame.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   No, because it's not a photo frame.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   Why do you do that?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   No, because you want it to be a photo frame.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   Remember, you don't --
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   You're going to turn it into a photo frame.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   Actually, all you --
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   We're not solving your problem.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   We're just covering it up.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   What did it use to do?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   There you go.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   Why do I not have --
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   No, I don't want to slide show my memories.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   Oh, you don't have to get it.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   Who does?
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   Okay, now maybe it'll go back --
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   Okay, now swipe from the speaker side over.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   We've tried every edge.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   Oh, there you go.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   It's done.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   No, no, it's done.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   Okay, don't hit that button again.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   You just were playing YouTube the whole time.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   Just stop.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   Now you're going to need to slide over again.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   You can turn it straight to the clock.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   There you go.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   Look at that.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   Oh, they're not sliding over the same way you did.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   One more slide will even be just the plain o'clock.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   That's what I want.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   Just the plain clump.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   That was a dip.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   Well, it was a dip.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   Jeff.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   Jeff, okay.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   I need some more cake.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:46.160]   I feel like your birthday really transformed you into a different kind of person.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   A crash to the only.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   I feel like all our shows will end up being this way.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   10, 15 years from now, the whole show will be --
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   What?
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   Did you try?
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160]   Hit the start menu.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   Unplug it.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   That's funny.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   Yeah, funny.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   It's my future flashing in my eyes.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   Never.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   That's what that means.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   Think about who will listen now.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   Leo, you can have --
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   This is twig number 2005, 100 seconds.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160]   We've been doing this for 100 years.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   Google, I should go out of this five years ago, but we're still here.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   We still caught this week in Google.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   You may remember Google.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   Good stuff.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   Well, thank you for that bit of technology help.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   Actually, I was glad you did that because I don't have anything to talk about today, really.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   I don't see --
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   I have something to talk about.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   All right, so start with Stacy and then we'll rotate through and you guys can pick the stories.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   We have a list of stories.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   None of them are inspiring.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   That's not true.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   I just didn't disagree with you.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   So Fast Company did a story -- I don't think it's on here -- about Google's ATAP and Dan
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   Kaufman, who is the --
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   I saw that, yeah.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   That's their advanced technology group, right?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   Projects, something, something.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   But inside that -- and this was an epic story, like two or 3,000 words even.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   This is our friend Harry McCracken who wrote this.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   Yes.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   Yes.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   Which he buried the lead, damn it.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   Harry.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   They're looking for -- or they're building a house mouse.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   That's what it's called.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   It's our most controlled.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   You can use to point at things to turn them on or in a kind of super fun things that uses
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   Google Lens to understand the picture on a CD, which granted no one has those.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   But you hold it down.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   It's like, oh, that's this CD.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   And then you point it to your speaker.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   The cute cat.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   Oh, but that's good.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   And then it plays.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   You say throw it over there.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   Yeah, and you can use this.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.160]   So it's basically a way to add a little bit more context to what you're trying to control
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   without you having to be like in my house right now because I haven't optimized things
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160]   yet.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   It's still like, hey, gee, turn on the blue shade chrome lamp.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   And that's just stupid.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   But I could just point at it and click or just say turn on lamp.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   And this is where I think Apple's going actually with some of the stuff they're doing with
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   Ultra Wideband and find two stuff in their phone and what Google's also trying to do with
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   Project Sully.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   I just thought this was really neat.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   One, because smart home, but two, who doesn't like reading about ATAP?
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.660]   Now with something like this, you're carrying around an extra dongle or you just carrying
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   around your phone.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.660]   It's I didn't go.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   You would have.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.000]   No, this is a dedicated device that would the ideas they wanted to create, like how the
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.240]   mouse opened up the user interface for computers for so many people thanks to the mice, the
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.920]   mouse and gooies.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.680]   They're hoping to do this with like assistance and control of all the other computers around
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   us.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.320]   Honestly, with Sully, you wouldn't need a device if you had a Sully sensor or a series
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   of sensors watching your movements.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   Why is this guy?
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   Isn't Sully using like IR?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.600]   Sully is what's in the front of it's the face recognition in the front of the pixel, but
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.320]   it's also the thing that does the gestures.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   Remember those gestures?
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   I can use it more like.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.800]   It's using radar.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   It's radar.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   Okay.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   No, it's I think it's radar.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   It's radar.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   Well, similar technologies bouncing something off of something to see where it is in space.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.920]   So that's they've got the Sully chip down pretty small, which means it's also probably
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.520]   fairly cheap to make.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.240]   So I would bet they wouldn't I mean, who needs one more thing to lose?
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.320]   I mean, my remote control table is pretty full right now.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.560]   I remember when I got back from Harry Potter world and I wanted to use my Harry Potter
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.520]   one, which by the way is behind me.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.040]   Yeah, but you can't do anything with it.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.200]   So I know.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:16.560]   So I wanted to have like the ability to point to the things and say, you know, when Guardian
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   let me.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.600]   Yeah, it's so cool at the amusement park because they have special areas so you can go, you
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.440]   know, you know, like Xia or whatever and then window shade will go up and stuff like that.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.560]   So it's kind of fun in the park, but you get home and then it doesn't do it.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   I think Stacy's home is like a park.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.240]   It is like amusement park.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.880]   Yeah, this is a great actually.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.800]   Thank you for mentioning this because I wanted to give Harry credit.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.200]   Harry's been on our shows many times and he's a really great writer and obviously got an
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.880]   invitation to write about a tap.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.400]   So and it's a great story.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.200]   All sorts of interesting technologies.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.400]   Is that mouse for your house?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.640]   That's the one you're most excited about Stacy.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.480]   I mean, you know, it's right in my wheelhouse.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.480]   So yes, by the way that that device would use Google lens as well to do the recognition.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.040]   So it's a lot of technologies Google has kind of rolled into one.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   It's interesting.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   Mrs. Stacy.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.280]   I got to do something with it.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   Well, no, that's the sad thing.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.600]   Remember that's the story of Xerox Park.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   They invented the future and then didn't know what to do with it.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.400]   That's sometimes the case with these R&D things.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800]   So go ahead, and you we had a question for Stacy.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.120]   Hey, I was on the ask would she be against using an existing device using your phone
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   or using your mini tablet in this scenario?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.640]   So I never have my phone on me.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.280]   This is I want to go.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.840]   But you'll have your house mouse on you.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   That's weird.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   Well, if I have my phone on you.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   So like ideally I would have the only thing I have on me as a Fitbit or a wearable like,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   you know.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.160]   So if they could put things in the wearable, sure.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.600]   But otherwise just having something that's why my smart house actually has buttons everywhere.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.040]   Like there's little.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   Okay.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   We know how to use buttons.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.840]   Well, it just it makes it more accessible.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.880]   Like some people don't have a phone or if people come into your house and they want to
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.560]   control things, but they.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.080]   That's why it should be your phone.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.800]   I don't want to go coming in my house controlling my things.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.080]   It should know who I am.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   But Benanna has a point.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.120]   You know, the new iPhone has the UWB Ultra Wideband chip in it, the U1 chip in it.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.480]   And I imagine all phones will some point have chips that are directional that do exactly
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.920]   that kind of thing.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   But yeah, it could also be a device.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440]   I said that, right?
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   Just like, oh, okay.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   I was like.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440]   But you're saying it's a separate device.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   The phone could also do that, right?
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   Yes.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   Yes.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   But this is also an ATAP project.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.040]   So they could integrate it into a phone one day.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   I mean, this is not like.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.800]   They're thinking of all different things.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.400]   I would hope, you know, we kind of talked about this on Sunday.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.880]   You were there this week in tech.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.200]   I would hope I asked the question and actually we got a great kind of synthesis from Phil
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   Liben about it.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.600]   I asked the question, are companies coming up with air glasses because this is what consumers
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.880]   want or because they're desperate to find the next thing and they're just throwing spaghetti
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.080]   at the wall.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.640]   And I wonder is ATAP.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.600]   What do you vote about that question?
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.200]   I think it's because they're on spaghetti at the wall.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.960]   I vote spaghetti too.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.560]   I vote spaghetti, but think about where we are with all of these smart devices right
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   now.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.960]   Think about when Amazon came out with that smart speaker and people were like, wow,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.760]   would I yell at my speaker?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.920]   You know, just it worked.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.760]   You know, I'm going to revise my opinion of echo and the other smart speakers.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.920]   At first, I thought this is the next interface.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.640]   This is the next big thing that voice interface will be very important and huge.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.800]   I really thought it would be.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.720]   I don't see that happening at this point.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   No, I agree.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   What?
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.440]   Do you see where you're spaghetti or no?
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.640]   First on the first one.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   I think it's spaghetti, but so I think it's spaghetti, but I think it's spaghetti in the
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.160]   sense like in the right, doing it in the right way, which is, hey, we have all this technology
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.400]   available to us.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   Let's play.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.480]   Let's make something fun and then let's see if it works, which I don't think is.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.160]   It feels like A-TEP is a little more like that.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.040]   But I think Apple and all these companies drive towards Google Glass is an example.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.520]   Towards AR glasses isn't really driven by consumers saying, you know what we really
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   would like?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.400]   It's a smart phone we wear around our eyes.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.760]   Well, but every Ford, you know, if I had asked people what if they wanted, they would
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.400]   have said faster horses.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.480]   So I would say there's room for spaghetti.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   Sure.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480]   You've got to innovate.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.400]   And if you're big enough company with enough resources, you can try a lot of things.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.120]   I just, there are a lot of cautionary tales like Xerox Park where, you know, they came
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.920]   up with, they invented the mouse.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.280]   That's where I, actually, Doug Engelbart invented the mouse and SRI.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.000]   Same idea though, which was these R&D think tanks often came up with great ideas that
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.880]   they never capitalized on.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.560]   I have the idea factory in a bookshelf behind great, which is all about Bell Labs.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   It's a good book.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   Great.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   Great book.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   And we wouldn't have Unix with that Bell Labs.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.440]   You know, a lot of server technology we have, a lot of the modern technology we rely on came
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.560]   out as Bell Labs.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.840]   So isn't really, they didn't come up with good stuff.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.040]   It's just that like Park invented the GUI.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   But they never did anything with it.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.640]   It took Apple coming along saying, Hey, yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.880]   Let's do that.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.720]   Bill Gross at Ideal Lab did a study of startup companies and looked at various factors of
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.440]   what made them successful or not.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.720]   And I'll cut to the chase.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   It was timing.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   Of course.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.800]   It's the guy who just the guy who created pets.com.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   Yes.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   And it was too soon and lost out on Chewy.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.160]   Right.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   And now that concept is actually that it's back.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   Right.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   It's too.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   All order was too.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.640]   He littered through the mail.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.720]   Meanwhile, Bill's the one who basically invented the Google lab model.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.680]   Yeah, it's timing.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.560]   It's more than timing, but I think it is it is.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.760]   But it is my as the major factor.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   It is an idea whose time has come, right?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.760]   There are lots of factors or everything's in place that it can work before you used to
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   it.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   They're ready for it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   But I interrupted you.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   You start on AR, I asked about spaghetti.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.920]   You were headed towards something else.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.600]   No, I think I got where I was going.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   And if I did.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   Okay.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   And it's too late now.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:25.240]   This is the old people shown how we're like, and twin Ed, what time is it?
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.320]   Did I tell you about that time I got cake?
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:36.200]   Google is now reportedly facing antitrust probes in every state, but one.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.400]   This is from Gizmodo.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.680]   Ongoing investigations by the federal government and almost every state, California's launched
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.480]   its own antitrust probe into Google.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.200]   Politico citing three people with knowledge of the new inquiry reported late last Thursday
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.400]   that the Italian, the California attorney general had opened the antitrust probe.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   This is the problem.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.720]   I think a lot of these are kind of in secret until they decide to do something with it.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:11.480]   Alabama is the only state not known to be investigating Google's practices.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.840]   And they're probably considering it.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.000]   Is that wild?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.440]   That's a tough situation for a company where you have one country, but 50 individual jurisdictions
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.840]   that are equally important.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.560]   It must be, must get complicated.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.960]   Yeah, and that's when they stop, like, for saying or stop going against.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.760]   What is the word I'm looking for?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.440]   Stonewalling on things like privacy.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.560]   It's when individual states start making their lives.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.000]   They're like, "Ah crap, now we've got to really do something."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.920]   Yeah, GDPR was a good start, but it ended up being the California Privacy Act.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   It seems to really.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.560]   Well, in Texas and Illinois, both had biometrics, security laws that kind of didn't really
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.600]   affect them, but so yeah.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.000]   So Google has paid the EU a $5 billion fine for antitrust.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.760]   That was a couple of years ago.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:14.520]   And they did, actually, this last week said that they were going to not use your Fitbit
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.600]   data for advertising in an update for the acquisition of Fitbit, which it feels like
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.800]   most people in the media feel like the deal is done because I'm constantly reading about
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   Google's acquisition of Fitbit.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   And I'm like, "It hasn't happened."
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   It hasn't still hasn't happened.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.000]   But the view is that was to get through EU, yeah.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Totally.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.920]   And I don't think Google wanted it for that data anyway.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.120]   They don't want to use your fitness data for advertising.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.160]   They want to use fitness data to become your health records repository.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.720]   And yeah, like, the EU falls to that.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.200]   And it's like, "Oh, there's a lot of people there."
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   A couple of that with geolocation.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Yes, that's a lot more valuable.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   But everything on your phone is that valuable.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.920]   You know, every app on your phone that has those permissions is that valuable.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.240]   Not if you don't carry your phone with you everywhere you go.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   All right.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.400]   That's why I'm Stacy, that just that just blows my mind.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.640]   I can't go anywhere like glasses or my phone.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.720]   Yeah, no, I feel the same way.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.840]   So this is why voice is so great to me.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.520]   And like, y'all are talking about how you're over voice.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.600]   I am so not over voice because that means I can do things without actually having my
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.400]   phone in my hand.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.760]   And since, you know, still women's clothes do not all have pockets, where am I going
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.800]   to carry my phone?
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   What is it?
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.080]   Their point to do this.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.000]   I know the crosses wallet, spectacles.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I can't keep.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I can't go to say it.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.800]   I can't fish this one.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.040]   I just realized what it is.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   Don't say it.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.640]   I go through a version of that every time I leave the house.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.520]   I pat my pants for the wallet, pat my jacket for the phone, Keeser and this one.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.280]   Oh, this is why I've never heard it.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.880]   Well, it comes from...
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   I apologize.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   I didn't know this one.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.400]   It comes from the sign of the cross, you know, the Catholics do.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:10.840]   And it's so I was a mnemonic for young Catholics schoolboys to remember the order.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.680]   That's a little dated because I don't think people carry pocket watches anymore.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.160]   Everything else they still have.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   So I don't know.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.840]   I think, yeah, we're getting more and more, you know, all the things you have to pat to
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.320]   make sure you leave the house.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.280]   And then if I, I mean, if I left the house without my phone, I would turn back.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.560]   There's some things I wouldn't turn back.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   I typically do.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   But I have to have the phone.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.400]   And quite frankly, the only reason I do turn back for my phone is because I'm listening
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.560]   to podcasts while I'm commuting to wherever I'm going.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   There you go.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.440]   If it wasn't for that, I would leave it behind and wouldn't really...
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.120]   I'm worried about missing an important text message or something.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   Oh, God.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   No.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   I miss important text messages all the time.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.920]   Nobody can actually end everyone in my life to just be like, they call Andrew if they need
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.920]   me.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.760]   They call Lisa if they need me.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.520]   Like, for instance, just got a message, Lisa's ordering Italian for dinner.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   What would I like?
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.480]   If I had checked, I would have missed that if I didn't have my phone.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.880]   But you have an app for an app for an app for an app for an app.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.840]   So you should get all of those notifications anyway on your watch, right?
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   Why didn't I?
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   Oh, you know why?
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.720]   Because I silence my watch because otherwise it goes bing dong, bing dong, vibrate buzz.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.080]   It does a lot of things.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.800]   It's a point of wearing it though.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   That's the point.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.960]   Well, are you saying if I silence the...
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.400]   No, that's a good point.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.080]   He is a podcast professional.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   So he knows this.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   Yes, when I come into the studio, I tell everything, "Shut up!"
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   I got a story I like.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   A story I like?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   Yes, please.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   I beg of you.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.920]   A huge, amazing, into my mind, upgrade to Google Engram.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.800]   This takes a few minutes to go through.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.560]   But if you go and look at all the things you can now do, what is Google Engram?
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   It can tell.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.760]   Google Engram takes the history of books from, I don't know when, like the turn of the century
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.640]   and has 1800 and has all of their words and senses in it.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.040]   And then you can look at instances of this over time.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   It's actually really good.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.480]   It used to be fascinating just for...
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.120]   We've played with it a lot on this show.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   Entities, right.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.320]   So they've added all kinds of things, which also indicates to me how smart Google is
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.640]   about the language.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   So one thing that's fascinating to me is that you can ask about words as verbs or nouns.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.360]   Give me an answer.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.480]   Do host, underscore, all caps verb.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.720]   Host, underscore, all caps noun.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.960]   I think you can see it.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:53.200]   I'm saying that I want to use the word host as a verb versus the word host as a noun.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.280]   Is that versus or both of those?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   It'll give me two graphs.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   Oh, I love that.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.520]   You see when people started ruining the language about 1960 there.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.680]   So you can just learn as a noun and partner as a verb because that is like the worst.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   Oh, good.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   That's a good one.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   Partners.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   Okay.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.240]   So when I host a show, that's really a bastardization of what should have been a noun.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.080]   I am the host.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   I am...
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   What am I doing?
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   Play host.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   I'm playing host.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   That's worse.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   Ooh, do Google as a noun or a verb.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   Oh, Google.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   You want to do the case.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Okay, it's case.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   Google.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.880]   Vibe.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.800]   So Google as a thing, as a... pretty much the same time.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.880]   The verb took Austin.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.640]   You could change the timing, I think.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.400]   Yeah, I left up there.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.640]   So I started like 2000 or 1998.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.600]   Is that what it came out?
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   Fascinating.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.000]   So for people who are listening and not watching, we're seeing a line graph.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.920]   And starting in 1998, the verb Google, as in I'm going to Google something, was second
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.240]   to the noun Google, go to the Google company, it remained second.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.480]   In fact, the Gulf widened until about 2013, when suddenly it became more common to use
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.040]   Google as a verb than as a noun.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.560]   You should make some nervous about their trademark, but that's another story.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.360]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.960]   And then did it officially go into the dictionary as a verb?
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.200]   Do you guys know what year that was?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.960]   I don't know that it is.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   Let me try Xerox Verbs.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   Seems like I've already sold Xerox.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   Yeah, let's do Xerox.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   There's only one function, folks.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.240]   There's others we're going to get to.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.120]   This is a really great research tool.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.240]   And all this data comes from books, right?
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   Yes, this books.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   Yes.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   So I wish they had newspapers too.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.120]   Or soon the web, but they will.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.720]   Xerox is a verb, not maybe--
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.120]   Well, I think you need a space there.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   I need a space.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   Maybe that's it.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.560]   Come on, syntax error.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.840]   It did not sound Xerox verb.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.480]   Maybe it's boundarized.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.760]   Maybe you're not allowed to use it.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.760]   That's interesting.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.560]   It's almost like you don't have a space there.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   What else can I do?
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.360]   There's a wild cart now.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.880]   So you can do university of asterisk.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.480]   Now, what is that going to give me a bunch of lines, right?
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   Yep.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.080]   And we could see which--
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.680]   whoa, look at that.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.040]   So the University of the New--
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.960]   no, no.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.800]   I can't believe it.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.280]   University of America is a biggie there.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.640]   Maybe you need to case sensitive.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.160]   Go back to case sensitive.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.080]   Try that.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.000]   No, it was case sensitive.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   No, it's case sensitive.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's worse.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   OK, never mind.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   All right.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   That's another one.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   It just said, "Search for university with a capital U."
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   Oh.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   That's the issue.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   Then we'll have just--
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   I'll make a case sensitive.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   --the case sensitive.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   Yes, it's case sensitive.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   All right.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   No, OK, right.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   No, it's still screwed up.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   I'm thinking.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   No, that's--
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.360]   There you go.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   That's better.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.360]   There you go.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.360]   University of California.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   University of Chicago.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   Who would think that would be right after?
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   Well, you know why?
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   The style guide maybe?
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.600]   Or, I mean, they published--
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   Oh, maybe.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   --the press, you know?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.720]   Well, I'm disappointed that you see you so far down and in Clemson, Orange.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   How dare they?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   Like, they're like, "
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   University of Chicago actually had a really reputable press, didn't they?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Right.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   Oh, they still do, yeah.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.440]   All right, here's another one.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   OK, this is--
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.640]   You do an inflection search.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   Inflection.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.320]   So, example they give is appending an underscore INF all caps to an engram.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.960]   So book underscore INF caps a hotel will give you the various verb forms of book.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   What's the hotel?
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   Yeah, it's a space hotel.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Space hotel.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   A-H-O-T-E-L?
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   Yes.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   Oh, like booking?
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   Book hotel.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   So, the most popular is the--
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   What would you call that?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   Book--
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Book me a hotel.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   Imperative.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   Imperative?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   That's it.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   You call it an inflection search.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   Inflection.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   Yeah, well, it's really the-- yeah, it's how it's inflected.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   So, book to his past tense booking is a present participle, right?
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   Books is--
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   Is it a gerund?
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   No.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   No, a gerund describes something.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   Right.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   No.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   Wow.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   We've forgotten everything we learned in English.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   This is fun.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   Working site.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   You only get 140 characters anyway, so English doesn't have--
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   Then there's a full list of tags if you go down.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   Oh, look at that.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.960]   So, I could now limit it by a time.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   Well, I'm sorry, you go back on the blog post that I--
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   You went to--
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   Oh, I wasn't on a blog post.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   I was just there.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   You weren't?
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   I was just enjoying my engram--
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   It's all the way down.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   I did not need to see that.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   Why are you going to spend the rest of the evening--
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   You've been off in there?
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   Oh, man.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   I love the part of speech.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   The part of the inflection tag can be combined with the part of speech tag,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   so you could do cook-inf-cook-verb-inf.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   We are nerds.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   Oh, we are.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   I made the week because of this.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   You're going to love this.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   You can find out whether the things that are at the beginning or the end of a sentence.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   Like, prepositions.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   Words in terms of dependencies, let's say you want to know how often tasty modifies dessert.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   So, rapacious technology company.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   You want to see how often one modifies the other.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Now, what books are in here?
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   All books?
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   All books that they've scanned, as far as I know.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   Which is a pretty wide spectrum of books, yes?
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   I mean, this is in English.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   I was about to say they're only in English.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   And didn't they get...
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   I don't remember the law.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Yeah, the authors' guild didn't like this much, but they think they lost.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   But they won.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   And this is not presenting the books here.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   They're just analyzing the books.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   Yeah, this isn't a problem, but it was the issue of the excerpts that they were publishing.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   So, you could see how presidents have been written about.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   This is what starts the sentence or ends the sentence.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   This was a start and end tag.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   Oh, very interesting.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Oh, nice.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   This is really...
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   So, do researchers...
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Now, I know you teach data at the CUNY, right?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   I mean, that's data journalism is a big thing.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   Yeah, I do.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   This is the kind...
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   This is one of the kinds of tools they might use.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   There's a tool like this that's pulling from the firehose of Twitter.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   No, but I would...
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   Determiner.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   Let's...
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   Or data miner.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   Can we talk about data miner?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   Oh, there's a story.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.960]   There's a story is right from the ripped from the headlines.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   That one is a highly useful, this particular time of year.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   Yeah, so the firehose...
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   Very few people get the firehose because it's a lot.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   If you could get all the Twitter stuff.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   And for a long time, people wanted it.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   This is the big story having to do with the firehose.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   One of its partners, partly owned by Twitter, is called Data Miner.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   And as Phil Libin said on Sunday, the name should tell you something about what they're up to.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:22.960]   They have the firehose intercept had this story that police used Data Miner, which will sell its insights to law enforcement and others, to monitor the protests that were sweeping the country after the murder of George Floyd so that they could find hotspots.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   And then Twitter said, "Well, no, they were just doing news alerts, but it's kind of a distinction without a difference."
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   There's also an important issue because Twitter has in the past, in 2016, for instance, told Congress that they would not do this.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:58.960]   They said, in a letter to the ACLU saying, "The use of Twitter data for surveillance is strictly prohibited, and that this is in 2016.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   Data Miner's product does not provide any government customers with any form of surveillance."
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   VP of Twitter Chris Moody wrote in a company blog post in 2016, "Using Twitter's public APIs or data products to track or profile protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   And prohibited. And yet, there seems to be some evidence that's exactly what Data Miner was doing in selling that information to police or monitoring protests."
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   So...
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   With that said, what's the next step then? If this is proven to be the case, what is the next step?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Good question.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   They either stop or they pull the feed, but I don't know if they would do that.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   What's wrong, though, with police looking at Twitter and saying, "Well, we just want to see where the next protests are so we can make sure we have law enforcement there to keep the protesters safe."
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   It doesn't mean...
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   Keep people safe.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   We're not going there to arrest them.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   What's wrong?
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   Why shouldn't law enforcement be able to use the Twitter fire hose and any data mined from it to help keep people safe?
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   Isn't that okay?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   We know I feel not this because we talked about it on Sunday.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   We have better police.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   Phil Libin had an excellent distinction.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   Actually, that was actually...
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   Well, and you followed up.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   Both Louise and Phil.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   Yeah, and you and Louise followed it up with this court decision about the use of FLIR technology going back to, I think it was year 2000.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   So, Libin's comments were basically that when you have all of the computing power of Twitter or AWS or whatever at your disposal, you're no longer using human surveillance capabilities and our laws and are only designed for protecting...
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   Sorry, when you go to that level, it is unreasonable.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   Superhuman capability.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   Yeah, it gives you a superhuman ability that is unfair and police should not have the ability to do that.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   And then we were saying that's a good point, but currently our laws don't really recognize that.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   And then we started talking about some of the legal frameworks that exist, which are all about Fourth Amendment search and seizure issues.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   So, this is actually a really good discussion.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   Case went back to 2001.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   They were surveilling what they thought was a marijuana grow operation using infrared cameras, thermal technology, the theory being, if you're doing...
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   If you're growing pot, you'll have hot lights in growing the grow lights.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   And in fact, they were able to observe a hotspot on this fella's roof using that FLIR technology.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   They didn't have a warrant.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   And the restee appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court where they ruled that authorities scanning a home with an infrared camera without a warrant is unreasonable search as barred by the Fourth Amendment.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   They said there's an expectation of privacy and because the imaging provided by the camera revealed details that would not previously been noble without physical intrusion.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   So, this is a big deal decision.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   That's a different...
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   But I don't see how that's a precedent here because this is not about privacy.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   It's things that have been said in public, but it's to Stacey's points is superhuman.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   It's not case that's the chance for surveillance.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   That isn't a drug-snipping dog.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   Out of bounds.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   Right.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   Well, and that's what our argument, we're like, this is an interesting case, but it doesn't.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   It's not really applicable here.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   We need new cases and we will see them.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   You see them already like with cases going for the...
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   I don't know why I can't think of words today.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   But the infinite searches for like geolocation data on people near a crime.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   So like police officers petitioning Google for that.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   Asserting expeditions.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   What is it?
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   It's not fruit of the poison tree fishing.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   Yes, fishing.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   Fishing.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   Fishing.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.960]   Fruit of the fishing pole.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.960]   So Stacey hangs out with us.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   She just gets old and forgetful.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   You didn't have a taco cake, Stacey.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   Did you?
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   I didn't.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   I asked, I put in a request for coffee though because I am definitely...
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.960]   When's your birthday?
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   You'll get some for your birthday.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   April 12th, it's so far away.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   You eat coffee sooner?
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   Okay.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   Now, Fika Friday is, you know, on Friday.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   Oh, Fika Friday.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   Yeah, Fika Friday.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.560]   Yeah, it's an interesting case because honestly, if you're posting stuff in public to organize
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.960]   a protest on Twitter, the police could certainly as individuals kind of be watching for that.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   All they got to do is look for hashtags.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   Right.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   But what this data minor does is it takes every post on Twitter.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.960]   Big fire hose and does dissend him an analysis on it.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.960]   So it could actually do more than saying, "Oh, here's a Black Lives Matter protest hashtag
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   in this part of town."
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   They could do sentiment analysis.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.960]   They could even go so far as to say, "We think it's going to be violent based on what we're
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   seeing in the tweets."
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   And I think that's a really interesting question.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   I think that if you were to assume that the police were benign and that their job was
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.400]   to protect the protesters, recognizing the first men are right, amendment right, to peaceably
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.440]   assemble the protest, that they were just going to use that information to go protect
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.960]   them, would you be against it?
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   Well, it doesn't seem like-
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:54.080]   But isn't the test instead now because police and policing are an institution that are
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.560]   troubled to say the least.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.480]   Maybe the test is not an ideal of police.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.320]   The test is, would you trust this happening in Iran or in China?
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.760]   And then if you say, "No," then you say, "Okay, well, maybe some of our police are good
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:17.360]   me, some of our police are bad," but which was your point, the two of you, was for his
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.200]   good benefit left out of this discussion.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.760]   He wasn't there this week.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:26.000]   I'm sort of on the fence with it though, because again, it could go both ways.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.560]   It's publicly-
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:32.960]   I'd like the idea of having the rights protected and the law enforcement being there to help
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.640]   protect the citizens that are wanting to peacefully protest.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.240]   But then at the same time, I've seen similar stories not necessarily related to the protest,
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.360]   but where law enforcement has access to so much data and power, and it can be abused,
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.480]   especially when they don't really know how to use that data.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.040]   Well, here's the test.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:57.000]   If you were a peaceful protest and you wanted police protection, you would call up the police
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.760]   department and say, "Hey, just by the way, we're going to be marching down this street
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   at this time."
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.280]   Right.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.600]   You get a permit, which is not required.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   Right.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.920]   Some jurisdictions try to require, but it isn't.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.000]   You're constitutionally protected to any peaceful protest.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.600]   But people don't do that.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   Why don't they do that?
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.360]   Because that's not, as we well know, that's really not the police's function in many cases.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.720]   In some cases, it is.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:26.480]   I've seen the police preserve the peace, surround a protest to protect the protesters.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.440]   I'm ready, you have Julele Pore did a history of policing in the New Yorker.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.600]   That brings policing back to America to tracking slaves.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:44.880]   Yeah, they were the slave hunting squads that went out to track escaped slaves in the North.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.320]   Apple just tweeted, "We're giving back to our community.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.280]   We support Bitcoin and we believe you should too.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.800]   All Bitcoin sent to our address below will be sent back to you doubled, only going on
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.520]   for the next 30 minutes."
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   Would you believe it?
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.240]   Yeah, they got hacked.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.880]   Soted Kanye, "I'm giving back to my fans.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.320]   All Bitcoin sent to my address below will be sent back doubled.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.680]   I'm only doing it to a maximum of $10 million.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.500]   Elon Musk, feeling grateful, doubling all payments sent to my Bitcoin address.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.320]   You send a thousand, I send 2,000.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.320]   Also only doing it.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.040]   You mean tell me Elon Musk doesn't have two FA?
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.320]   One of these guys do, it's the same Bitcoin address for all of them, and even Bill Gates.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   You see everything.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.360]   Everyone is asking me to give back and now's the time.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.600]   I'm doubling all payments sent to my Bitcoin address for the next 30 minutes.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   Apparently, Jeff Bezos was also hacked.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   Wow.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.080]   You can tell all the journalists who follow these accounts and, oh my gosh, for the first
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.000]   time in some cases, they're getting tweets.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.840]   They're like, whoa, and then they're like, oh.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   Well the real issue is it sounds like this may be a bigger problem with Twitter security,
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:04.320]   because some of those people have to be using two-factor Cameron Winklevoss says that all
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.360]   major crypto Twitter accounts have also been compromised.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:14.240]   He says, "Two-factor and a strong password was used for the @gemini account we're investigating.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:22.000]   So maybe we're seeing is a massive Twitter security flaw that was discovered by, obviously,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.200]   Spammers do not send Bitcoin to that wallet."
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.960]   Send it to me.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.440]   So don't send it to me.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   I don't know how to get in my wallet.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.680]   It's a ant.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.840]   It'll just sit there.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.400]   So I don't see, and this is a Verge story from just a few minutes ago.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:46.760]   I don't see the Jeff Bezos, but some of the chat rooms said it's Bezos as well.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.600]   So I really wonder what's going on there.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   I think you're right.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.800]   I think at least some of those people must, I mean Bill Gates is using two-factor and
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   a strong password.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   He must.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.120]   That's just crazy.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.520]   We would like to assume that Twitter is up on its game far as having these things secured
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.880]   and not necessarily using the whole plain text fields and stuff like that.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.640]   But it seems a little particular to this happen.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.360]   It's at these level of tech-minded people.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.080]   I mean Elon Musk.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.240]   Here's Jeff Bezos.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   I've decided to give back to my community.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   I like how they...
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   It's pinned.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.480]   I like how they customized these two.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   Wow.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   They really...
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.920]   They took some care.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.560]   This wasn't a big massive spam.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.000]   This is Brian Krebs watching about it.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.200]   Krebs of course is a really great speaker.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   Also, he says they're Coinbase, Beyonce, whatever.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.400]   Binance, Coinbase, Pinance.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   You know they missed a bet.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   They should have been Beyonce.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   I don't think they are Binance.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.400]   Oh, Binance.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   Okay.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   I'm...
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   You were...
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.040]   Sorry, I was reading fast.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.040]   We old people.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   We just kind of skip over things.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   So this has to be...
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   And you're over.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.720]   Has to be at something wrong at Twitter.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   It seems highly unlikely that these guys would have been not...
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.080]   At least some of these guys could see Kanye.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:20.240]   We know Kanye's password from when it was revealed in his visit to the Oval Office.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   All right.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   So...
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   888.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.800]   I have a feeling Kanye maybe isn't using two-factor.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   But these other guys must have...
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.440]   Well, Elon Musk has found now.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.600]   Well, I'm sure a lot of them are down.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   Well, maybe.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   Maybe so much.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   Maybe so much.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.520]   That was hired into Twitter.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.360]   Remember the...
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.920]   Mike Bloomberg also, but his is down now.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   So...
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   Yeah, Stacey.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   The...
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.280]   It was a Trump thing, right?
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   Somebody...
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.160]   Didn't somebody get into Trump's account?
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.600]   But we don't know what the president's security.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.760]   Apparently, the Biden account was hacked.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.160]   Somebody's saying, but I don't see the tweets.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   Uber.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   I'm wrong at Twitter.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   Check your accounts.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   You're accounts.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160]   You're a check your accounts.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   Check your accounts.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   I don't know.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   I mean, Twitter has had inside jobs in the past.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.320]   They had the people spying for Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.120]   And those were employees that were compromised.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.080]   I'm just throwing that out there as a way.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   Like if you...
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   I don't know if it's really a Bitcoin thing or maybe it's like a nation state or who knows
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.080]   anymore.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.320]   Man, did Alice Woolhill get it too?
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.320]   Really?
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   Alex?
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.600]   Checking now.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   I did not.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.680]   I'm happy to say.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.160]   But...
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.360]   Don't challenge anyone, Leo.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.040]   He says, starting to get embarrassed that I didn't get hacked.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.280]   Yeah, I didn't either.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   Oh, damn it.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   Oh, man.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   Alex and I didn't.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   Oh, man.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   I love that guy.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   Well, that's a big story.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   I'm sure...
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.600]   I think that has to be a security flaw, Twitter or possibly in such a...
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.960]   Kevin Roost says, if whomever apparently has read/write access to every verified Twitter
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.600]   account also has access to those accounts DMs, this could make the Sony hack look tiny.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.600]   Ooh, that's a good point.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.800]   It's true, but if you're not using Signal with your sources, bad.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Ooh.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   That's...
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   Yeah, you should not be using Twitter DMs for secret anything.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   But that's a really interesting...
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.840]   I mean, I used DMs to reach out to people, but...
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.920]   Yeah, that's a really interesting point.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.600]   If you were going after that, though, you wouldn't be putting up the stupid Bitcoin
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   thing.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.040]   You'd be pulling all that stuff down unless it's already pulled down.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   It may well be.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   It may be the final...
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   It may be the final...
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   Maybe it's just...
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.680]   Then it may be some stupid teenage boy.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.840]   So here's a new rule in life.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:45.560]   On Twitter, when I find myself in a face-palm discussion with somebody who starts getting
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.080]   all wacky, I never will be able to look at their profile.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   Crypto.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   Every time.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Really?
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   Crypto people.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   Yep.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   Every time.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   It does.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.800]   It's definitely a crypto fringe.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.560]   There's a magnet there.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:08.560]   Well, that was a conversation.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.360]   You know what?
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.360]   It sounds like they might have...
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.520]   All in the crypto is crazy.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.240]   Apparently Barack Obama.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.560]   I think they might, in fact, have...
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.600]   I think Kevin Rus might not be far off.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.840]   They might have access to all verified accounts.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.600]   Oh, no, that's me.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   That would be horrific.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.600]   Nobody takes over any account.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.000]   I'm verified, yay.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.800]   Or if you're going to tweet something like that, you probably would start with verified
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.880]   accounts for sure, right?
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.080]   Well, you would probably do something both verified and above a million followers, or
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.440]   pick a pretty good ratio, right?
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Right.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   Not a rich show, sorry.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   Wow, that's a really interesting story.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   That just broke.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.760]   About one o'clock Pacific.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   So that's...
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:04.200]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.920]   Does Twitter have a circuit breaker that puts everything up pause, like the NYSE?
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   Because now would be a good time.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   It would be that...
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.120]   Now would be a good time.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   Now would be a good time.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.920]   Jack, maybe Jack's meditating.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.760]   Jack, wake up.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:20.040]   More busy with his other companies.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.480]   Come back from square for a minute.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.360]   You're too in fine.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:35.360]   This is already in a paste bin of all of the sites.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.600]   This was a Brian Krebs tweet.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.280]   Risk IQ's list of domains tied to this scam.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   Already?
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.480]   How did they do that?
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   They must...
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   I don't know.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.560]   They searched Twitter for that address, baby.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.060]   I don't know.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:58.000]   These are websites, so I'm not sure what this site is I'm looking at.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.560]   You could do...
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.520]   Couldn't you send like test...
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.920]   It's like trace routes, but would you see those addresses?
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.480]   No, you would see the...
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   Nevermind.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   I don't know.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   I'm not sure exactly.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.560]   Cryptocurrency scam domains.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.280]   So wow, apparently there are cryptocurrency scammers out there.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.680]   Who would have thunk it?
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.680]   No, no, I hate.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   Everyone's a scam.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.280]   What do you think is going to...
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.680]   So Facebook, remember when we...
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.320]   I loved your hypothetical, Jeff.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.520]   If you were at dinner with Jeff, Jeff was there, but it was...
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.320]   Mark Zuckerberg was the center of attention.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.280]   If you were there and you could say to Mark one thing that he would do, guaranteed no
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.720]   matter what, I said ban political ads.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.680]   And Jeff, you raised the interesting point that there are a lot of candidates who that's
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.960]   the only way, affordable way.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:58.280]   It's the only way they can afford to campaign, especially now, but you can't go door to door.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   Right.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.600]   But now from Kurt Wagner, I think your former colleague, right?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   Stacey?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   Facebook...
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.280]   No, he wasn't at all, giggled.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.920]   Facebook, malls, political ad, blackout ahead of US election.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.200]   This is a Bloomberg story.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.240]   malls is not the same as plans or think that's merely mulling.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   Well, or...
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   I have thoughts on this.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.400]   Most probable rumination, right?
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.800]   Jeff, probably about a week ago thinking about this, and I don't remember why I thought about
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.920]   it, but let us...
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.120]   It was in the idea of political ads.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.200]   Oh, I know.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.480]   It was because I was reading about the effect of marketing and the goals of marketing, right?
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.960]   And typically advertising is to get you to buy something.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.720]   And that serves the interest of capitalism, right?
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:54.880]   You're buying a politician as a good that you think you can recognize and understand.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:00.320]   I would argue that banning political ads would actually be great because we no longer would
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.760]   think about them as a consumable kind of product.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.000]   They're not part of a capitalistic structure.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.800]   Instead, if you think about it from a democratic perspective, like as in a democracy, you would
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.640]   have the politicians sharing their views on Facebook.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   Right.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.520]   And then those being shared naturally.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.720]   So I would actually say, I've been thinking about this, Jeff, and I come down on the idea
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.720]   that a politician should not be allowed to buy ads on Facebook.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.720]   So...
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   Okay.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.240]   So, Stacy, here's the thing.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.960]   If you're either the UK or you're France or Germany and you cut out all political advertising
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.920]   across all media, I would agree with you.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:47.000]   However, if all you cut off is Facebook, then what you're doing is driving those dollars
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.800]   to the expensive media, which is media, and it's highly inefficient, highly expensive,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.720]   and that means the big money power only becomes bigger.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:01.560]   And of course, we don't ban advertising on TV because we don't do that.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   That's exactly what Alex Staimos...
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:09.360]   Facebook's former security chief said, eliminating online political ads only benefits those with
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.560]   money, incumbency, or the ability to get media coverage.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.560]   Right.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.560]   That's right.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   So, I interrupt...
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.560]   Okay, interrupt one second.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.600]   I'm doing a purposeful interruption here, Stacy.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.760]   I'm sorry, but it's on the big story.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.720]   If you go to Alex's Twitter feed, you can watch the money going into the Bitcoin account.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.200]   Oh, and then you can see that on the side.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.560]   Sorry, Stacy, but I wanted to let him break you into this kind of thing.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   I'm actually putting money.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   Oh...
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.560]   Oh, dear.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   You can watch the money...
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.360]   There's 296 transactions.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.640]   Oh, here's the Joe Biden one.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   297.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.800]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   This is...
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   Sorry, Stacy, but I thought that was too good to give up.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   Clearly.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:54.880]   I mean, if Biden isn't using security keys, you know, Titan security style security,
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.880]   I'd be shocked.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:01.320]   By the way, Brianna Wu tweeted an interesting story.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.760]   She has a long, strong, good password on her political email.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   Yes.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.840]   And it was guest or hacked or discovered.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.040]   She says, "Thank goodness for Google's Titan keys because they weren't able to get in
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.800]   because of the physical key."
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:23.360]   You have to think every politician with maybe one notable exception, every politician has
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.760]   to be using this kind of dongle-based security.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.840]   You can use it on Twitter.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.120]   I am using it on Twitter.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.840]   I really...
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   If Biden...
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.560]   This is an inside job or a Twitter hack.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.280]   It's 297 transactions.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.680]   A total of 12 Bitcoin received.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.840]   So how much is that now?
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   299 now.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.640]   12 isn't a lot.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.480]   12 Bitcoin is about $120,000.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.280]   But it's clear...
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   110.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   110.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   I was about to say that's a lot of money.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.960]   That's a lot for a no effort.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.520]   The scammer definitely is happy.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:06.600]   And by the way, for most of these transactions, a considerable lag.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:13.240]   So you won't see the bulk of the scammed contributions right away.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   It could take offs.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.240]   Oh.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.920]   You can't pull it back, right?
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.280]   There's no once you've done it, you've done it.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.840]   Oh, yeah, you've done it.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   All right.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.840]   So Stacey, I did interrupt you.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.480]   I get accused over this time.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   I actually did it.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.440]   I thought that was a good quick angle.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   So you were saying...
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.440]   Sorry.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   So rude.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   This was back to media.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.560]   Oh, I wonder how...
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.400]   And I wish there was some good research on this.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:40.880]   Demographically, how it breaks down to people who see political ads.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.400]   Because so many people don't watch network TV anymore.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.800]   People who are watching Fox News obviously are going to be seeing ads, but they're also
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   watching Fox News.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   I don't know.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.040]   So I'm very curious because I don't know how many people actually see big media in
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.680]   today's day and age.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.840]   Nonetheless, so look at the options you have as a candidate, right?
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.200]   Best is canvassing.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   Golan.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   Events.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   Golan.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   Phone calls.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.640]   You do it, but everybody's answering their phone anymore.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   Nope.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.480]   You can do online events on Facebook.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.320]   You just don't have to pay for people to ask.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.800]   Yeah, but you've got to find people that way.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.240]   They've already got to be in the tribe.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.760]   You're not going to be walking by downtown and saying, "Look at this fair going over that
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   nice candidate."
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760]   Right?
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.800]   That's what your existing network is not necessarily growing the network.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   Exactly.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   Exactly.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   Yes.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.400]   So what you're left with...
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.000]   So then your point is right, Stacey.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Does anybody...
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.960]   You know, newspaper ads?
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   Right?
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.920]   But my Congressman Tom Wollanowski here, who's great and I support him and he's wonderful,
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.720]   you know, he's not going to advertise on the New York TV stations because it's wildly
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   expensive.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.600]   He could afford one ad in the whole campaign.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.160]   Who knows if I'm watching that, right?
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.560]   Local cable, destroyed it in the mess.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]   Direct mail.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.080]   Well, that's probably your best bet, but it's expensive as hell.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.840]   A lot more expensive than Facebook.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.560]   And you can only afford to do so much.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.160]   So you're kind of...
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   Especially now...
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.240]   I mean, the pandemic makes it even worse.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   It's already this case.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.560]   It's even worse now.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.920]   If you take away Facebook advertising from people that's highly targeted to a geo and
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.160]   demo and probably interest you, I'm not going to waste my...
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   If I'm a certain candidate, I'm not going to waste my money on NRA fans, right?
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   So what I...
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   Why should I?
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.720]   You could do is do partnerships with issues that matter.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:50.120]   So let's say you're an anti-gun activist or just you want stronger handgun legislation.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.680]   If you did a partnership with like every town for access to their mailing list in your
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.280]   area, that is a creative way across.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.640]   And you would have to actually have substantive discussions with those groups to get access
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.800]   that you were trying to change things.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.000]   So I agree with you that it would be more difficult.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:17.320]   I don't believe that that will stymie people for too long because it is easier to get access
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.360]   to people and to pull in people.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:29.720]   So if we had an all-out reform of political ad spending, I would be delighted.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:37.000]   But short of that, to take away the most efficient mechanism there is today, good and bad, but
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.480]   it is the most effective means of advertising.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.560]   I think hamper is both candidates and campaigns.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.920]   I think this is something...
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   Obama too.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.360]   I'm looking at Obama's pages that Twitter, it's not.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.800]   So maybe the campaign or something else.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.520]   Brian Stelcher has a screenshot of it.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:06.680]   I think these are the questions that Facebook is asking the self-hars, this whole "molen
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:13.520]   it over" thing because I speak to my mom a couple of times a week regarding what's going
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520]   on day to day.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.000]   She does sales, she does ad sales.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.600]   And she's been pretty particular about this time of year because it's sort of a damn if
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:28.560]   you do, damn if you don't for the people that are wanting to buy ads for the network because
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.960]   they know that this is a pandemic, they know their revenues have really been cut back so
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.640]   they don't have the money and they want to get the biggest bang for the buck because
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.120]   TV is awesome, it's usually worth it from an ROI perspective, but probably could save
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.720]   a little money and get a bigger reach if they use Facebook ads.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.800]   Who knows?
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:56.120]   So Stacey, in principle I don't disagree with you, except that when you then dig into it,
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.280]   if you're a good candidate now, or if you're tomorrow's AOC, the AOC you hasn't been discovered
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.400]   yet, you're not incumbent.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.840]   You're so limited, it just favors the incumbents so much.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.800]   Unless I agree with you though, Jeff, if we just ban all political advertising on all platforms,
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.480]   then it's well, even then incumbents, you know, as they have been, they did yesterday,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.360]   you can say, come to the Rose Garden, I'm giving an important statement, then you're
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.360]   giving him any statement.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.200]   Yeah, it's always, you know, it's always have an advantage.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.320]   So the key is figuring out how to be more nimble and how to do crazy things and political
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.880]   history is littered with this.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.440]   I mean, that's how we got like crazy, what is it, whistles stop tours and I mean, you
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:50.040]   see it throughout history and I'm not a student of political science, but I get your point,
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:56.120]   Jeff, but we don't live in a world where we can just turn something off at a time.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.760]   You're turning Facebook off your turny Facebook off with the drop of the hat.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.760]   Yeah, I'm turning one element of an entire system.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.160]   Yes, but then you have unintended consequences across the world.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.520]   You do and I'm going to say, yes, we will have unintended consequences.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:16.760]   We will probably lose some segment of, I mean, anytime you change thing, you're going to,
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.480]   you're going to lose some segment of people who were unequipped or unable to adapt to
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.560]   that change.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.920]   That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.120]   It can be.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:30.800]   It's terrible for the people who get, you know, who may have otherwise won, but we'll
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.500]   see what those are after the first election cycle and then we'll move to address it or
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.080]   those people will adapt.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.400]   And I mean, what you're saying is we don't want anything to change because this advantage
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.040]   is non incumbents right now, which is good.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.400]   No, I'm not saying that.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.560]   No, I'm not saying that.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.040]   I'm saying that's one of many factors.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.680]   And I'm saying that another factor is you're going to drive more money to big media money.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.760]   You're going to entice more big media into the campaigns.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.560]   You're going to, there's a lot that happens then.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.360]   Facebook has become, this is not just political advertising, it's all advertising, right?
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360]   It's not small businesses.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360]   We've done advertising.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.840]   Yeah, we've done super efficient advertising on Facebook that it's, I think, a good service
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.120]   to people who found like the newsletter who were like, oh, I didn't know this existed.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   It's going to be.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   Right.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.880]   But so I want the next AOC to be able to do that.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   Mm hmm.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   Mm hmm.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   Wouldn't you?
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.520]   Pick your candidate you like.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.400]   I, well, my last elections were all in Texas.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.840]   So all the candidates I like, they didn't, they didn't win anyway.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.400]   And I didn't read about them on Facebook.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400]   That's the other thing.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.640]   The candidates I've found were usually, I mean, in honestly, in a lot of ways they were just
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.280]   indivisibles like, here is someone who is not a crazy Republican.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.040]   Because, you know, really in Texas, that's all you can do.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.040]   This is a tough one.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.480]   I think you make a good point, Jeff.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:07.080]   And I just, I feel like the worst way you could get political information is via advertising
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.240]   by anybody, any candidate.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:17.680]   Because it's just not, it lends itself to, you know, Twitter length insight.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.480]   But maybe that's the only thing we've got.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.040]   I think we've got a problem is what we've got.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   Let's take a little break.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.040]   We're going to come back.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.440]   I will give you, we'll get a, come back and give you an update on the, the Twitter story.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   That is a breaking story.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.200]   That is something pretty wild.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.000]   It's Twitter breaking on right now.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   It's broken.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Yeah, clearly.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.480]   Our show today brought to you by CashFly.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.840]   Now we use the CDN.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.680]   When you download our files, whether you do it from the website or when you do it from
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:50.720]   your podcast application, you're getting it not from our servers, not from, you know,
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.040]   our website, but from CashFly.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.000]   It's a content delivery network.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   And I got to tell you, that makes a huge difference.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.440]   You may not notice it, but believe me, you would notice it if we weren't.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.040]   Files come in as fast as they can because you're getting them from a server near you.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.000]   Availability is almost perfect because CashFly has distributed all over the world.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.800]   No, you know, nothing can get in between you and our show.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.960]   That's why we've been using CashFly for years.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.240]   We're big fans.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.320]   There is always one hitch though, if you're using a content delivery network.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:29.000]   And that's when you get a cash miss, when the file you want is an on that server that
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.120]   you're checking.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.200]   That means then the server goes out typically and goes to the origin for that data.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.800]   In our case, it would be, I think, Amazon Web Services.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.240]   They'd go to an S3 bucket and get the file.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.040]   Now when that happens, you're paying, right?
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.240]   If it happens a lot, you're paying a lot.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.400]   That's why CashFly came up with something I think is fantastic.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.200]   100% cash shield with this new feature, you're going to benefit from a drastic reduction
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:01.760]   in data transfer fees from things like Amazon's S3 and other cloud storage origins by increasing
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.800]   the cash hit ratio to 100% no more cash misses.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.920]   When a cash item is evicted for a large one-off request, not only does it cost you money,
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.080]   it means your customers are going to have to wait a bit.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.840]   4K content will buffer, the download will pause, and you're going to just spend a lot
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.000]   of money in data out transfer fees.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.640]   So what's the solution?
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.680]   You buy space on CashFly with their 100% cash shield.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:37.760]   And you now have guaranteed availability, no extra cost because your digital files, your
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.400]   cash is being loaded directly from CashFly.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.680]   You can purchase as much space as you want, your data is fetched from 100% cash shield
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.520]   rather than from your origin.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.520]   It keeps your data and content closer to your customers without relying on other companies'
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.440]   backbones or traffic.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.760]   You're going to see an incredible improvement.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.720]   Your bills will be lower and your speeds will be faster.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.440]   Just one of the many ways CashFly is your perfect CDN.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.960]   CashFly's global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are delivered five
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.640]   times faster than from the origin.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.640]   It's almost instantaneous.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.440]   Look, if you want to know more about CashFly, if you deliver content, whether it's an app,
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.360]   a game, video, or podcasts, go to twits.cashfly.com right now.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.080]   They're giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.080]   trends.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.160]   You can see if you're overpaying, you can probably save you as much as 20% of your bill
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.800]   they sure did for us.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.240]   And there's no pressure, no sales, it's just the information you need to make the right
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   decision.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   We love CashFly.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.120]   We're very grateful to them.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   twit.cashfly.com.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.160]   Twit.cashfly.com if you want to get that information.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   What's the latest?
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   I'm watching Twitter.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   It's blowing up.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]   It's going crazy.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.440]   Twitter said that they are now aware.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.080]   So like three or four minutes ago, they said, "Hey, we are aware this is happening and we're
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.640]   looking into it."
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.360]   Hashtag hacked.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.560]   It's trending.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:13.040]   And you're seeing on this hashtag hacked a lot of people, not President Trump.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   He was not hacked.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:24.360]   So that's because no one believes President Trump would double your money for anything.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.880]   It is one of the problems, isn't it, with Bitcoin that anybody would even believe this?
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.480]   Let's check in real quickly with the site to see.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   The problem is hackers often will mess around with their Bitcoin wallets to make people
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.000]   think it's going crazy.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.720]   So you can't really look at the activity in a Bitcoin wallet and assume that it's all
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.960]   from people who are falling for this.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.120]   Mike Bloomberg falling for it.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   They're not falling.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.960]   There has to be everyone's coming to the realization that this has to be inside Twitter or someone
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.200]   has you know, fruit access to Twitter.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.360]   Or there is a much more concerning.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.280]   There might be a security flaw that has allowed somebody into Twitter.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.800]   It may not be an employee.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.560]   It's clearly coming from the inside.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.200]   But far worse if it's an advanced persistent threat, if somebody's hanging out inside of
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.480]   the Twitter servers and able to do stuff, it will.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   Then your DMs might be vulnerable things like that as well.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.880]   This is a big story.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.560]   As Twitter said, I think it just that they're aware.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.320]   Yeah, there's support just said that they're aware this is happening.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.640]   That was like two minutes ago.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.320]   I keep seeing something that an admin account was compromised.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.480]   It keeps popping up on my feed.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.400]   Yeah, I don't know though.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.960]   I think Twitter's got precautions even if an admin account was compromised.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   Do you think that they could allow people to do?
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.280]   Yeah, boy, that would be pretty serious.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.040]   Swift on Security has some useful things if you follow.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.720]   Yeah, we don't know who it is.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720]   It's not Taylor Swift.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.480]   I think we're pretty sure of that.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.040]   But I'm going to call her she.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.880]   She is always very good.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.520]   You could always just say they.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.280]   They split the difference then.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   Might even be they.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.560]   So some useful threads there.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.400]   Wow.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.040]   Uphah.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.440]   And stock trading down.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   It was 5% almost.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.840]   You think it's related now because of this?
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.200]   Why wouldn't you say hey Twitter, you don't know how to make money and all your top users
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.680]   are getting hacked.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.160]   Is it possible that all of these users are using a third party?
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.240]   Maybe the third party got hacked?
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.720]   I don't think so.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.880]   I think that's highly unlikely.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.240]   There is too diverse a group.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240]   But that is one thing.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.560]   I'm trying to think how will 2FA help this scenario?
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.880]   Well, this isn't a 2FA situation.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.880]   So this is what's coming out.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.400]   That's why I'm presuming it's either somebody with admin access.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.680]   A Twitter insider or somebody who is hacked into the Twitter servers.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.520]   Yeah, because you couldn't do this.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.680]   Presumably at least some of these accounts have two factor, which means there wouldn't
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.280]   be vulnerable from the outside.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   Oh, now interesting.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.160]   No, that was 59 minutes ago.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.640]   I'm not going to repeat this because it does not look real.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.640]   It's old.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.440]   Oh, I did load it old.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.960]   News gets old so fast.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.880]   So you know, clearly we don't know exactly what's happening.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.360]   Clearly it's taken Twitter a long time in the internet time to respond.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.800]   And it looks like it's an inside something.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.440]   Just shut it down, man.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440]   They responded.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   Just pull the plug.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.840]   They responded eight minutes ago.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.800]   So clearly they're all sitting listening to this show.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.640]   And once we alerted them to the situation they acted.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   You're welcome, Twitter.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.040]   They were like, what?
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   The OSS has thrown the big switch.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.720]   The plug.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.280]   You do wonder what is that?
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.640]   What did you call before the stock market?
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.600]   The kill switch or the pause training?
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]   What's the circuit breaker?
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.600]   That's what it was.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.560]   Yeah, no, that would make sense.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:41.240]   I mean, how would you like a shopping cart that instead of hacking it hacked?
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.240]   Instead, yeah, probably could.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.960]   Instead of having one of those Amazon grab and go stores near you, what if every store
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   had an Amazon grab and go shopping cart?
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.440]   Hmm.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   I'd use it.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   I'd be so excited.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.840]   So having done the Amazon go is free.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.360]   It's called a dash cart.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.640]   And the idea is it's got a touchscreen.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.320]   It's got hardware components, probably cameras.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.600]   You don't have to scan things.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.480]   You just throw them in.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.920]   And you're are done shopping.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.080]   You take the cart through a special lane.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.400]   Boom, the express lane.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.600]   It's just like fast track for your shopping and you're done.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.360]   And of course, Amazon loves it because it all goes through Amazon.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.800]   The first grocery store in Woodland Hills in the Los Angeles area.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:34.320]   To be fair, Amazon for because retailers were so leery of giving up their data to Amazon
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.200]   for the Amazon go package because Amazon is selling that to companies.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.680]   They said that they would not share.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.280]   They would not have access to the data.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.960]   So it's possible that this cart would not share access.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.160]   This cart's pretty cool.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.440]   It's got a cup holder.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.560]   It's got what is that square thing?
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.960]   Something for hold your keys maybe or your phone.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   Your phone.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.880]   And then it's got a tablet that shows you as you throw things in the cart, what it thinks
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.440]   it is and what the price is and your total.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.360]   And I think that's pretty darn cool.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.840]   Where's your baby?
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.840]   Stop.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.680]   There's still a little seat right there.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.680]   Don't take your baby.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.040]   But would it charge you for the baby by accident?
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Yeah, probably would.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.880]   Every baby has a UPC so now.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   So that's interesting.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.280]   The Amazon, you're priceless.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.600]   The Amazon Dash cart perhaps coming soon too.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:33.040]   By the way, this is actually good because it's a cheaper way to bring that service to
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.400]   places that don't want to outfit their grocery.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   And I bet they'd be to high demand for those carts.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   No checkers.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   No whizzing out the door.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   No check.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   I mean, like, oh man.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   Oh, but you got to bag it yourself.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   I hate that.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   Really?
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   I used to be a bagger.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   In COVID time, you want to.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400]   I'm so over bagging.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.760]   Yeah, in COVID time though, you would now want to touch that screen.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.840]   I hate touching touch screens even for COVID.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   That's a good question.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.800]   Like a restaurant's when they hand you a tablet.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800]   Oh, no.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.800]   That's why you got to have a clean key.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.320]   Oh, yes.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320]   Have you been to a restaurant?
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.720]   No, I'm just saying even before COVID when people handed me a tablet, I'm like, I do
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   not want to touch this.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   Oh, I see.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   I was talking about it myself.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   It's pretty yucky.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.800]   That is one good thing, by the way.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.600]   We were going to have much better hygiene when we're done with this, right?
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.600]   Right.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   I hope so.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.600]   We're all going to expect it.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   I hope so.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.600]   So handshake.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.240]   No more handshaking.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.360]   I think we can get the changelog going here.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.280]   Do you have the orchestra?
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280]   Is it ready?
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.280]   Are they?
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.720]   Tell them put down the cigarettes and play the drums.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.720]   The Google changelog.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.880]   A kettle drummer is notorious.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.840]   Notorious.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.760]   These are things Google has updated or changed in the last week.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.600]   This is kind of more like maybe this is going to happen.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:05.360]   A new design for Gmail integrating chat, meet and document collaboration all in one place
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.560]   introducing your new home for work, just what I want.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.920]   Oh, it happened.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.840]   They announced the changes.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.520]   So this was a leak, the Verge had, but now it's happened.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:23.360]   This is if you use Gmail on the Gmail app on iOS or Android, which I don't, which I
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.520]   don't.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.240]   It also looks like it might happen if you use the website as well.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:34.600]   Side by side document and that's kind of cool alongside chat, picture and picture meetings.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.040]   So you never have to leave your Gmail again.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.520]   I for one welcome my new home.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.520]   Do you live in Gmail?
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   I live in Gmail.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Back in box.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   I would be really happy.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   I love you.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   I love you.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.320]   And the way that it is, I hope it just, I just don't want them to clutter it up too much.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.440]   I like the idea of having stuff pretty easily inaccessible, but it just don't make it too
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:04.040]   cluttery and make the user use the design look really weird.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:11.680]   See, and you know, to me, this is Gmail now is clutter because I got used to inbox.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   You never had an inbox person.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680]   Right.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   Right.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.240]   And see you never get hypnotized by inbox.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.120]   No, never, never tried it because I'm not an inbox zero person.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   I think I mentioned this.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.520]   Well, no, Lord knows I'm not.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.640]   That was the point and it was like, but I'm not.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:37.600]   I tried it and I was like, it took me a while, but then I came to love it and then they
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   stashed away from it.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   I remember you fought it.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600]   You fought it.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   And then as soon as you can.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.600]   Oh, I love it.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.600]   I loved it.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.080]   Like Lucy with the football, they yanked it away from you.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   Yep.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   They do that.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.440]   Do you ever lose your recently up loaded pictures on Android?
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:21:01.800]   Now Google photos will add a recently added filter in the search tab so you can quickly
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.880]   find the photos you recently added.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.400]   I didn't know that was the thing.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   I didn't either.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   I just told you the bottom.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   That's it.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.840]   I mean, mine are there like as soon as I hit the shutter up there.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   It's really quick.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840]   Mine aren't.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840]   How do I force it?
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.720]   Mine take a day.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.720]   Really?
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   That's weird.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.200]   And I'm on the cracky internet here at my house and it still goes up pretty quickly.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.200]   I'm sitting at home.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.200]   I take a picture of the cake.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   It's the day later.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   It's up.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   What?
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.200]   I'm forcing to force it on the picture.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.880]   You've always been able to do that because like sometimes like when I was when I would
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.520]   be covering events and I wouldn't be on Wi-Fi, I'd be like, Oh, I need you to send this right
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520]   away.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   So how do you force it?
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.920]   How do you force it from from Android?
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:46.920]   Okay, hold on.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   So you thought it was a toggle switch to see it.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   Upload it.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   Upload it.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   I don't know.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   I've done it before.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.320]   So let me take a picture and see what happens.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320]   I am on my way.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   It is an issue.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.720]   I know you're on an Android phone because it is an issue on the iPhone.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.800]   If the Google Photos app is running in the background, eventually Apple kills it and so
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.280]   you have to have it open to buy more than photos.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   But Android should be instantaneous.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   It feels like.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280]   Mine's usual.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.520]   Yeah, mine was only if I wasn't on my Wi-Fi network, but I just took a picture and I was
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.520]   on the way.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.520]   Well, you can turn off.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.280]   Yeah, you can't say, you know, if I'm not.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.080]   That was the only restriction I had on mine at one time.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.000]   But now I don't have any restrictions.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.800]   And it's quick.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.720]   Well, I just got the new version.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:37.240]   So if you hit the little hamburger menu up there, just say add to album and back up now
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.240]   and it will do it.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240]   On the way, what hamburger menu?
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240]   Where is the?
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.640]   So when you take a picture, it resolves, right?
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.840]   And then there's a little hamburger menu on the leftmost side.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840]   The three dots.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:58.120]   If you hit that menu, you can click back up now or add to album.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   Oh, thank you.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.120]   Oh, very nice.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.440]   And it also, this is useful.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.480]   It'll show you the metadata associated with the picture.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.240]   So mine puts my picture on a map.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:14.760]   I think Carson's got the right idea here.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:21.400]   After you hit 60, they do slow it down for you because seniors are used to having a day
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.000]   for the 24-hour photo to give you a little heads back.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.600]   So they don't want to be too fast.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.640]   I like going to that nice young lady.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.760]   As we all drive through photo holds, they're used to waiting.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.280]   We don't want it scary if the picture shows you.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   I have five by sevens, ma'am.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.280]   I like bigger.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.760]   My eyes are getting worse.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.480]   So what the bigger photos of 4.6 is just don't forget my raisinette.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   See you there.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Raisinette.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   You get raisinette.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.280]   That's your photo, Matt.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.280]   Wow.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.280]   Fancy.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.560]   You had a fancy photo, Matt.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.560]   Gee bar.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.520]   So it goes to echo or records, the drugstore.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520]   Records.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.520]   Records.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520]   That's a change on there.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.080]   So I'm going to stay on the targeting for one second.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.880]   So I think I've figured out the Wall Street Journal.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.440]   He's my most frequent advertiser.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   Why?
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   Everything that I get advertised to me is something a liberal would like.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.400]   Uh oh.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.280]   So the Wall Street Journal, which is not known as a liberal newspaper.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280]   No.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.680]   Unless you're my mom.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.040]   If you're so far to the right that the journal looks left, okay.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:35.840]   But for anybody from the center on over, it's considered kind of a conservative.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840]   Uh yeah.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840]   Nothing wrong.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840]   Word on.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.680]   You know, people with lots of money tend to be more conservative.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   They don't like change.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.360]   They want to keep ahold of what they got.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.040]   I don't blame them.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.600]   Uh nevertheless, what it makes them advertise to you so much, you liberal lefty.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   I don't know.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   That's so strange.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.680]   It's only a thing as I would like.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.280]   Because they want to sell you a lot of credit.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.840]   They want to say, hey, you'll like us.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.480]   You're so bad.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.480]   That's the good.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   That's the American way.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.080]   We will profit off of the left, the right, the center.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.680]   We don't care.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.160]   Your money is just as green as anybody else.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.960]   Green is green, baby.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   Gboard.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.720]   They probably just think, oh, Gboard.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.000]   Sorry, go on to your chain.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   So keep changing.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   I'm not in a hurry.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.320]   I'm going to keep on changing it.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.840]   I'm going to keep on changing it.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.800]   Gboard prepares a Google lens shortcut and dark light themes.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.920]   Follow the system settings and Google Assistant dictation support.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.780]   Now if you're using a Pixel Gboard, you're going to fall keyboard on other phones you
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.000]   need to install it and make it the default.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.240]   Now this is another one of those APK tear down stories from XDA developers, which means
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.240]   it's in a future update in many cases.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.440]   But they've found a lot of strings describing all that stuff.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.600]   They make Gboard good again, because lately it has sucked.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.880]   Yeah, I stopped using it, actually.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.680]   Yeah, I used to like it, but now it's auto guessing things all the time that are just
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.680]   here.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.560]   Yeah, the auto guessing is a bit annoying.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.280]   I give you that, but I like the feel of it and I like the additional features that they've
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.080]   added at the top to give you different size and options and other little tools built in.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:40.640]   It's faster than what it used to be, because I used to hate Gboard, but it's a lot better.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.040]   It's come a long way.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.080]   So this is fun.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.320]   This is a thank you chat room for passing this along.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:27:04.000]   If I go to Twitter and I search for that Bitcoin wallet and I filter by verified, I could probably
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:12.600]   find all the people who got bit while all the verified people who got bit.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.080]   I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.920]   You see, there's the verify, the blue checks.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.800]   The tweets from people without blue checks are just freeloaders.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.240]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   Look at this.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240]   Look at this handle.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.240]   These are randomly generated handles.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.120]   Do you think this might be a nation state kind of a attack?
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.720]   Like a precursor to an election attack.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.720]   I was actually thinking Russia out.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720]   So this is a--
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.720]   That's one heck of a username.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.480]   Yeah, this is randomly generated and look at its tagline.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.360]   I'm giving back to my community due to COVID-19.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.360]   And of course, I would imagine its tweets to be--
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.120]   Hold the count.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.000]   Join July 2020, brand new.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   Wow.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   So this is related.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   You should report that.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   This is related.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   Oh, they're busy with other things.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   I don't want--
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   Right.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.560]   I don't want to slow them down.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.040]   Google Fit is added, curated, YouTube playlists.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.600]   For those of you who like to exercise at home, playlists
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.720]   called things like, work out with me.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.400]   Nine minute fat burning routine.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.800]   Oh, these aren't music playlists.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.080]   These are actually--
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.080]   Exercise playlists.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.600]   Exercise.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.120]   I'm totally for this considering the state of what's
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120]   going on now.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:34.960]   I'm getting so fat, Ant.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.120]   I got to do some lifting.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.360]   The problem I have with this is you don't want to do these one.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.480]   This is 76 videos.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.920]   Don't do a nine minute fat burning routine.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.960]   And then a senior gold dance fitness party in the chair.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.680]   And then a home fitness workout,
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.480]   trained right with BBC Sport.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.280]   And then a full body workout weight loss.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:55.760]   That's--
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.600]   OK, so I've got to argue with you and say,
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.160]   this is actually super fun.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.080]   So I--
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.080]   I'm all for it.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.240]   You just do the first one?
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.160]   Yeah, it's like a quick, like, boop, boop.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:04.680]   This sucks.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.360]   You're like, ah, it's over at eight minutes.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:06.360]   You know?
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.720]   And then you get to something in my mouth.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.680]   So you just do one of them, though.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.680]   You don't do all 76.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.080]   You do-- you don't do all 76, obviously.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:12.600]   Right.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.880]   You do as many as you can till you fall over?
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.200]   No, you just do as many as you're feeling up to for that day.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.800]   Like, I do-- like, I have Pilates subscription.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.520]   And you'll like--
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.040]   there's an option where you could pick like arms core and legs.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.880]   And you could do that.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.480]   Or you could do like a hit plus core.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.000]   My--
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:31.600]   Loser.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.360]   My Pilates instructor is doing a 100 burpee a day challenge
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.680]   for their husband.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.160]   This--
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.000]   That's a lot.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.760]   That's a lot of burpee.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.200]   That's a lot of burpees.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.040]   That's a lot.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   That's a lot of burpees.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.200]   Hats off to you.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:44.880]   She did it.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.360]   But I--
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.600]   I did this.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:50.080]   We've talked about similar instances
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.840]   like this on Hands On Wellness, Wink, Wink.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.040]   We need some type of option to work with.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.840]   But you have a Hands On Wellness thing, and--
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:57.840]   It's a great show.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.840]   Yes, ma'am.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.640]   And it speaks to me.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.040]   And I didn't know this.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.040]   Is this something--
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:04.560]   What?
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.520]   This is on Twitch.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.720]   It's a little podcast network you might have heard of called
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   Twitch.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.720]   No way.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.440]   It's a TV slash--
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440]   Wow.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440]   Wow.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.440]   It's really good.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.440]   Oh, you're going to love this.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.120]   He's got all kinds of work--
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.960]   TRX work-- all kinds of workouts, all kinds of things
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:20.960]   you could do.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   Oh!
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   OK.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   I'm subscribing right now.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   Oh, thank you.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   Thank you.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.960]   Thank you.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.560]   Well, no, I've mentioned a couple of different services
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.600]   out there because we really need
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.640]   to be kind of the end of just--
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.680]   we're sitting at home in these home studios
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.000]   or home workstations.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.400]   And we're not moving around.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.120]   We're not getting up like we used to if we're working in the
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.040]   office, going to Chit Chat.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.680]   We're not taking our 10-minute, 15-minute smoke breaks or
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.920]   walk breaks or anything.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:56.040]   And everybody's gaining that extra 15 pounds for no reason.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.000]   So take advantage of these little services, whether it's
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.160]   home workout or this thing that Google is offering up.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.120]   And they're free.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.040]   Doesn't jump on it.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040]   Yeah, jump to it.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.040]   Wait, is that it?
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   Do it a push-up?
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.360]   Oh, you want to see it doing a push-up?
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360]   Stand back.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.080]   Oh, no, he's not as like smiley as--
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.720]   I didn't register it as "ant" for a moment.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.240]   You've got to be aggro when you're doing the workout, man.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.560]   He's looking so intense.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.000]   I'm like, well--
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.040]   By the way, hands-on-willness is not just workouts.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.200]   It's also wellness, a gear wellness--
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.360]   It's all wellness tech.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.320]   Tech-- yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:28.840]   So--
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   Perfect.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.840]   Oh my god.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.200]   That's my cake.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.480]   I have to just know.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   Yeah, I'm getting so fat.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.120]   I got a gained COVID-19.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.440]   Don't worry, Mr. LaPourne, I'm still obese.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.800]   That's why I'm-- no, yeah, because that's just BMI.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.520]   That's why I'm dressing all in black now.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.480]   Because you can't see anything.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.480]   Look how slimy you look.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.240]   You can't see anything.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.480]   It's slimming.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.480]   Except then on my head that sticks out of the black.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.480]   I need to--
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   I need to get--
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.480]   I need more.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.480]   So we'll just ask them to change the light in the studio.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.680]   Oh, god.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.440]   It's depressing.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:09.680]   Google Earth is-- Google says-- we've always said Google Maps
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.560]   is about finding your way.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.520]   Google Earth is about getting lost.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.480]   See the planet in new ways.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.840]   It's 15 years old.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.360]   Happy birthday, Google Earth.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.680]   And so this blog post has a lot of Google Earth stories
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:31.160]   you can do to celebrate the anniversary.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.760]   Lit trips, tours that follow the journeys of literature's
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.760]   well-known characters.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.840]   Isn't that kind of fun?
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.400]   Protecting culture.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:40.880]   This is--
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.000]   My daughter, when she was young, loved Google Earth,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.080]   she would spend as much of her free time just zooming in
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.720]   on places she'd been, places she'd never been.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.640]   Well, she should go to it now because there's
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.440]   a lot more stuff in there.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.640]   I mean, there's videos.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.480]   Oh, I think she just kind of pops in on the regular
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.920]   just to check in and see what's up.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.720]   It's really cool.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:06.200]   15 years, Google Earth is almost as old as Twitters.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.040]   That's kind of neat.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:08.720]   Hello.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.400]   You know, I benefited from when Uncle Leo did a garage cleanout
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.680]   and brought all of his old tech into the Twit studios
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.920]   and just said, here have at it.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.600]   I have the Oculus.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.080]   This would be fun with the Oculus.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.640]   And here recently, the family and I,
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.920]   we've been jumping on to Google Earth VR.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.080]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.480]   And it is such a great experience
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.960]   and allow you to see things so up close and personal.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.920]   If you can get your hands on the VR version, it is awesome.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.840]   Yeah, it's a shame Google killed cardboard
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.400]   because that was a very inexpensive way.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.480]   But you could go in on your phone.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.400]   You don't have to have it on the visor
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.840]   and still see the world in VR.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.720]   So we recently got back from Rio.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.880]   Oh, what fun.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.440]   Oh, what fun.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.600]   Well, that's true.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.160]   Yeah, do little fun projects.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.040]   There's also a-- there are three
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.240]   where in the world is Carmen San Diego capers.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:06.680]   And now--
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.040]   Oh, we should do that.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.800]   You can do-- there's doing news in there.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.880]   Vox is doing news stories in there.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.160]   So this is great.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.080]   Happy anniversary.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.360]   15 years of Google Earth.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.160]   Cheers.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.800]   And this is just broke today.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.200]   Google Meet is adding Zoom bombing protection.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.000]   That's a lowercase Z, huh?
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.320]   I guess Zoom bombing has moved from noun to verb.
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.080]   Google will block anonymous users
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.640]   from joining video conferences if you're doing it
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.080]   through G Suite for education as it should be.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.000]   A lot of the bombing, as it turns out,
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.680]   was really just kids in the same class kind of messing around.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.160]   As kids do.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:55.600]   As kids do.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600]   What?
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.920]   Kids take it in varied technology.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.600]   How long?
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.600]   It's happened.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   What?
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.440]   No.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.400]   And that--
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:07.200]   Juvenile jokes is your--
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:17.480]   So did you guys see that you can buy a hardware thing of Zoom?
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.240]   I love that.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.480]   I just was just looking at that.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.360]   It's not expensive.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.480]   It's about $500.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.680]   The Zoom tablet.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.080]   It's $5.99.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.160]   That's expensive.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.000]   Wait, what?
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:26.720]   Well--
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.760]   For a dedicated Zoom tablet?
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760]   OK.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.760]   You're using it all day.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.960]   I buy a Chromebook for less.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.800]   Yeah, but it's 27 inches.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.560]   That's-- I mean, I don't think that's outrageous.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.360]   It has software for doing things like whiteboarding and stuff.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.320]   It's a built-in touchscreen device.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.880]   It has three cameras and eight noise-reducing microphones.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.240]   So you're going to get a better picture, especially
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.480]   than on a Mac laptop.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.640]   Did Apple create this?
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.200]   No.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.280]   No, no, no.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.880]   Well, Zoom did it in partnership with a number of companies.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:03.440]   The first one is Zoom for Home.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.600]   And it's called D10Me.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.320]   I guess that's the company.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:10.080]   D10 is the thing.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.800]   Yeah, San Jose-based company that makes video conferencing
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.080]   appliances.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.440]   What are three cameras doing Zoom?
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.400]   What's up there for you in Zoom?
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.240]   Oh, we'll have to buy one and find out.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.040]   Does it track--
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:25.880]   You're going to buy one?
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.240]   You can buy one, Leo.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.000]   I was thinking-- you know, I was thinking
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.960]   this would be good for as my mom.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:32.680]   So because I--
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:33.160]   Yes, this is--
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.280]   That's who it's for, right?
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:34.800]   We're seniors.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.680]   OK.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.520]   Well, then it's for us.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.200]   We have to buy it, Leo.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.000]   And then I was also thinking--
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.360]   at first, I thought, well, wait a minute.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.520]   If you're working from home, you're on a computer.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.440]   Why would you need a separate device?
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.080]   But actually, as I thought about it,
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.920]   if you have the room for it on your desk,
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.800]   having a separate device is nice,
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.160]   because you can still use your computer
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.000]   as you would normally.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.600]   And the call is a separate thing.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.440]   This is effectively a video phone.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.520]   And by the way, other companies are doing something similar.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.720]   This is Zoom.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.480]   This is just the first one from Zoom.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.400]   27 inches, though.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   That's pretty big.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.720]   As you can see, it takes up a lot of space on the desk there.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.320]   But it's mobile, though.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.560]   So you could pick it up and take it down to the kitchen.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.640]   Maybe to the kitchen.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.560]   27 inches is pretty big for a kitchen.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.320]   I think your wife would kill you, bringing a 27-inch phone
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.600]   to the kitchen.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.080]   It's not allowed her to talk to her friends or her parents.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   If a plate Disney brought us, it'd be great.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.720]   My wife would kill me.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.440]   No question about it.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.680]   You could never get Disney Plus off of it.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.680]   So it also makes it easier to present.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.080]   It's got meetings, whiteboards, contacts.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.040]   If you have a calendar, the calendar
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.400]   will be on the screen.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.120]   I don't have that.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.360]   Let's see if I can find that.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:50.960]   Why wouldn't they do it?
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.680]   Well, I would like to use my Google display that I already
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.680]   have two of, or my Echo display for Zoom.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:02.640]   Go back up the Zoom, go to the Zoom, Zoom Home, Super Home.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.440]   No, no, no, down.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.840]   Scroll down to the link.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:05.360]   Right there.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.680]   Right there, the link.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.720]   Oh, actually, look at the actual product.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.240]   What a thought.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.160]   Yes, there you go.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.080]   See, this shows the calendar.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.960]   So if you've got a Zoom call, you just press the Start button.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.480]   You're in.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:18.440]   Yeah, the three cameras.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:21.600]   It looks like it's left one's pointed right and one's
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.640]   pointed center.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.200]   So maybe--
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:23.960]   Do you walk around?
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.800]   Maybe you can walk around, yeah.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.000]   Or maybe the ideas you could have multiple people
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.640]   in your meeting.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.120]   I don't know.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:30.960]   I don't know.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.680]   Yeah, it was probably designed for an office.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.960]   And they're switching it right now to home.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.440]   Yeah, I bet this was all ready to go.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440]   Put this in your office.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.360]   And nobody's in the office.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.720]   Right.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.560]   So suddenly they just rebranded it.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.520]   Three intelligent white--
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:44.880]   That's interesting.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.840]   Facebook used to have a wall of Skype,
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.400]   where they just had--
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.360]   It was like this idea of your remote working, basically,
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.080]   that you could actually stay in touch with people all day
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.280]   long.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.920]   And it's kind of similar to the idea
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.120]   of having video conference hours where you would just
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:08.400]   have your video conferencing on for a time period just to--
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:08.400]   Office on.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.600]   --fee in the office when you aren't in the office.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.160]   Now remember that-- and I really wanted one of these,
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.920]   but it was a lot more expensive.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.800]   Google did its own smart display, right?
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.840]   With-- it was a whiteboard.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:20.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.040]   We had one of the--
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:21.960]   Oh, the fancy whiteboard?
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.320]   --of the schools.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.240]   --semartered things.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.640]   I thought Microsoft did that.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.920]   Microsoft also did it.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   Microsoft still sells--
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.360]   It was a little complicated.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.040]   They call them the-- oh, and I forgot.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.040]   It's not a hallway.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.200]   Smartboard, smarter things, something like that.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.720]   And there was the surface table.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.680]   That was different.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.360]   That's what it was.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]   It was a surface, wasn't it?
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.080]   They had purchased a company that made giant monitors.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.680]   And in fact, they've got one coming soon.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:50.040]   That's going to be a better-- wait a minute.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.960]   Ultralight and portable, 14 pounds.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.080]   Ant maybe would think that's ultralight and portable.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.240]   Me, I'd be honest over.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.720]   Hands-on wellness.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.480]   That you can lift your Zoom monitor.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.720]   It's not that much.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.040]   All right, let me pre-order one, because I think we probably
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.040]   should--
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.960]   We probably should have this.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.480]   Woo!
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.160]   I could probably do the whole show from it.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:17.520]   And you could do a little segment of ant lifts technology.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.640]   And so you could just--
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.560]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.120]   --make a giant watch week.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.920]   How heavy is it, Ant?
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.760]   Not so heavy.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.120]   It'd be like, this is a pro-rehabit purchase
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.080]   when you don't have any other options at home.
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.000]   They're always like, you can lift weights with--
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   Oh, I should probably get two then so that you could do a bicep curls.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.080]   No, because you do the bicep curls.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:37.880]   It does do business.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.200]   Well, you could just squat with it, like a 15 pound weight.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.040]   15 pounds?
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:41.640]   No.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.400]   I think that's even like bicep.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.320]   I just thought the 50 pounds--
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.960]   You could curl probably 20, those big 20 pound dumbbells,
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.920]   35 pound dumbbells, in your sleep.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.040]   Go higher.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:53.880]   50?
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.600]   They even make them that big?
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.600]   Yes, sir, they do.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:57.920]   That's--
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.800]   It's exciting because I could bench 50 pounds,
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.640]   and now I just feel sad.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.600]   He does 50 pounds with one hand like that.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.440]   Pinky.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440]   But it's pinky.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:07.960]   It does.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:08.800]   It just spoons.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.720]   It's pinky.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.480]   Is that how you do--
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.240]   I've never imagined this appliance being something
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.520]   you could use for all your hosts?
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.560]   No.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.360]   No, because of the software, we'll just mess up,
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.040]   try to do the show.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:18.520]   Well, we--
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.200]   I'm still trying to wrap my head around
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.400]   to three different cameras and how it knows--
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:22.720]   It stays way--
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.120]   It stays smart.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.840]   So as you move, it can--
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.800]   I guess-- I don't know.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.280]   That's why I have to buy one to find out.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.760]   OK, we'll look forward to that, sir.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.880]   Yeah, let us know.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.160]   So I end up doing calls with people from Facebook
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.760]   on-- like they had the portal--
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.960]   Information Session about the oversight board.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.240]   And there they use-- the Facebookers are using the portal.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.680]   And they walk around and it follows him.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.040]   Yeah, I had a portal in my house.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.320]   It was so creepy.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.400]   So I gave it to Burke.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.240]   It's gone now.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:58.840]   I don't know what--
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.360]   And there's no telling what he's done.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.040]   I have no idea.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.440]   He's turned it into a robotic vehicle probably.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.400]   Wouldn't surprise me.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.200]   I had two of them.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.640]   That was-- I shouldn't buy this because I did buy two of those.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.000]   And the idea is I was going to send one to Mom and one here.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.360]   And it did follow your own because it's a 4K camera.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.280]   And so it was kind of neat.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.880]   I think it was pretty sweet.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   I like the story time.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.480]   Google, just nice will follow you around now too.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:21.920]   Will they?
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920]   Oh, good.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.080]   Of the camera on them, yeah.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:24.800]   Yes, that's right.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.520]   I've noticed that.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.840]   But I'm just trying to think aloud here.
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.720]   Has the three cameras on there?
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.240]   And as Mr. Jarvis suggested, you had a couple of people
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.360]   in the room on the same call.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.520]   The mics are going to be sensitive enough
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.680]   to pick up three different inputs.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.520]   It's got eight mics.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.000]   Because they had eight mics.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:44.840]   So yeah.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.360]   But it's tied to some smarts around where the--
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360]   You could steer the mics.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:49.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.640]   It's just like--
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:54.040]   Remember Cisco's fancy audio camera technology.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.680]   Oh, that's right.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.880]   OK.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.760]   Did anybody get an invitation to Eric Schmidt's Secret
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.640]   Summer Camp?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.440]   Not me.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.640]   Is it on the county?
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.520]   No, it's in Yellowstone, which is a country club.
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.240]   And whereas--
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.280]   Not even the virtual one.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.840]   You think I could at least get to the virtual one?
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.640]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.520]   They're doing this year.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.560]   Lady Gaga, Senator Cory Booker.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.640]   It's so secret.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.360]   Rico did analysis of flights and things
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.320]   to figure out who's there.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.560]   Just to see who is there.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.000]   So a privacy--
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.720]   So the Allen and Co is not on this year either,
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.080]   is it?
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.360]   The Sun Valley Conference?
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.240]   It's--
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.440]   No.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.040]   No.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.720]   You wouldn't get a bunch of billionaires face to face.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.800]   Or maybe they're so rich they can't get COVID-19.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.200]   That might be the case.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.440]   I think that's what they want you to take.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.960]   Romney has a summit.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.160]   I didn't know that.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:48.720]   Oh, there's a lot.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.040]   Apparently a lot of them.
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:50.880]   Everyone has a summit.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.680]   Charlie Rose used to have one.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.080]   Yeah, well, try not to do--
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.440]   You also took pictures from that one.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.280]   No.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.600]   My favorite was the fake one on the TV show "Succession."
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.440]   Did you see that?
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440]   That was really good.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.720]   Yeah, really enjoyed that.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.240]   Also billionaire, had one too.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.560]   Billionaire, had one too.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.160]   So you've been to some of these.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:12.000]   I mean, you've been to Davos anyway.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.200]   Is that kind of like what it's like?
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.680]   This is much more--
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.120]   Much more fancy.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.280]   Yes.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.280]   So of course, the reason that they do these--
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.440]   they say it's to make the world a better place.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.160]   What it really is is to make the political connections
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.480]   that you need to make a Google or richer company.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.200]   They're all just golfing together.
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.120]   You know, I actually--
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.880]   I've been to the Bohemian Grove, which
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.920]   often got dinged for being--
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:46.360]   --the room where it happens in a private space where
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.880]   all the big kids get together and plan world domination.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:52.920]   It's just a bunch of drunk guys peeing on trees.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.960]   It's not.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:55.600]   Yeah, sure.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.680]   That's what he has to say.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.880]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.080]   He's talking about it, though.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.160]   Well, but that is true.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:06.520]   They make-- it's not overt, in fact.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.840]   I think the key to all these is not overt.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.720]   Like, all right, let's make a deal here.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.640]   You take these--
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.280]   I'll take the west coast.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.160]   It's all subtle, but the friendships
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.880]   that you make are very, very valuable.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.880]   That's why I was in Skull and Bones at Yale,
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.520]   because those people are now on the--
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.160]   No, of course not.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.320]   You think they let me in?
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.720]   Oh, this kid looks like you're a free--
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.360]   Those are prizes.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.760]   --future Supreme Court Justice.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.440]   Let him in.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:38.400]   No, we had our own Secret Society, like Skull and Bones.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.840]   It was called Bong and Spoon.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.280]   We had T-shirts, anyway.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.000]   You should call it-- you should have called it Caked and Baked.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.920]   Caked and Baked.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.440]   That's so--
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:51.160]   More fake than cake.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.600]   I like it.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.360]   Cake and baked.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.360]   Or baking cake.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.960]   Kind of that's more of the usual order.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:58.800]   Yeah, baking cake.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.240]   Maybe.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.040]   Shaking baked.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.520]   But honestly, I think these really
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.360]   are social events as much as anything.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.880]   But everybody knows that the friendships and connections
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.840]   you make, that's--
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.400]   Well, and deals get made there.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:09.520]   Do you think deals get made there?
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.120]   I don't know if they're going to get made there.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.280]   I think they get made after the fact because of the meetups.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.360]   I think about some events that I've
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.880]   been invited two years and years ago that I had no idea.
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.680]   I would ever be invited to those things,
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.440]   and it led to relationships--
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:24.960]   Absolutely.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.960]   --that led to the side of those events,
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.760]   just because we hung out in Swangagar--
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:28.360]   It's very powerful.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.600]   --and pea trees and stuff like that.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.160]   But you're saying that sometimes people say, hey,
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.920]   let's go have a cigar and let's work this thing out.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.000]   Just the two of us--
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.560]   Yeah, or they just-- they get to better talking.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.680]   And they're like, oh, you know, you're
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:44.840]   bemoaning a problem.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.960]   And someone's like, oh, actually, I
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.480]   know a guy who can solve that or I have something that
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.160]   can solve that.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.000]   Let's get together.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.040]   And they sit down and they believe me.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.640]   This is how deals happen.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.480]   And it's frustrating.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.480]   As I'll say, as a woman, when I was in Texas reporting
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.680]   all the tech execs in Austin would go on this hunting trip
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:09.320]   down to Argentina.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.040]   And that's where their deals got done.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:12.760]   And you're like, no.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:15.200]   And there were never any women on those trips.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.240]   Yeah, women do not go on those trips.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.880]   The events that I've been in, they were hardly ever
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:20.640]   any women.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.440]   Not that I think about it.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.600]   Yeah, because women can't--
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.400]   Well, we can pee on trees, but it's a little less graceful.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.360]   Just not as graceful.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:33.520]   Truthfully, if you pee on a tree, sometimes a tree will pee
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.000]   on you.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.960]   And that's where it really becomes a problem.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960]   So--
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.480]   We're just going to stop this whole line of conversation.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.360]   This can go nowhere good.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.640]   Let's just hit the brakes.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.520]   Let's just stop.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.720]   Wendy's is trying to make a Bitcoin joke.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.640]   Their Twitter account.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.560]   Oh, dear.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.400]   What is the joke?
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.360]   I think too soon.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:55.840]   Too soon?
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.880]   Make no sense.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.720]   It makes no sense, all at your point.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.200]   Wendy's Twitter account.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:47:59.880]   This is Twitter account.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.040]   Honestly.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.480]   Is it just Wendy's?
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.840]   It's-- yeah, Wendy's.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.240]   Honestly, this is the problem in a way I have with all of this.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.120]   Do you think that Stacom's or Wendy's,
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.680]   besides getting some press, really
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.280]   gets any real benefit from their presence on Twitter?
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.880]   Real people don't care.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.080]   So Stacom's your high-interviewed Nathan Alabach.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:24.600]   Right.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.840]   The Stacom's guy.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.440]   And you can find that on Buzz machine
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.680]   if you want to watch it.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.160]   It's a very nice guy.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.600]   In their case, it's like Taco Bell.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.800]   You take an old brand and you're trying
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.000]   to infuse the brand with something new.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.520]   Taco Bell was not cool.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.240]   Taco Bell is now cool.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.040]   Who would think?
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:43.960]   I mean, I'm going to--
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.440]   Yeah, but they did things--
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.760]   Other things to make them cool, like when they said,
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.400]   hey, space station, hit our target,
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.360]   and everybody in the world gets a free taco and stuff like that.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.240]   They've had--
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.400]   That's good gorilla marketing.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.920]   And that has a-- I just don't think Twitter has much reach,
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:01.080]   to be honest.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.440]   But then it gets talked--
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:08.520]   Twitter is a spark, and the fire goes on in media.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.440]   All right.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.320]   Oh, you can't tweet from your verified account now.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.360]   How fun is this?
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.240]   Oh, that's one way to solve the problem.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:17.840]   What?
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:18.800]   Let me try to tweet.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.680]   That's interesting.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.000]   Oh, that's certainly--
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.080]   I have power.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.160]   That's certainly one way to do it is, well,
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.080]   we won't let any verified people tweet.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.040]   Nope.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.600]   Something went wrong.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.840]   I am verified and tweeting--
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.480]   Blue fuzzy have been silenced.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.640]   The proletariat now rule.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.160]   Something went wrong, but don't fret.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.360]   Let's give it another shot.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.520]   This request looks like it might be automated.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.640]   You don't seem real, Leo.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:47.760]   So that's interesting.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.400]   So if you got the blue check, no tweets for you.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:52.200]   Tweets.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.960]   So the mass has taken over Twitter.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.480]   That tells us, though, that--
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.480]   The privileged are now a sideline.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.480]   They may be incorrect, but the Twitter believes
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.720]   it's related to the blue checks.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.440]   Because if somebody had full access to Twitter,
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.640]   they could tweet non-blue checks, too.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.760]   But it sounds like they believe that there's
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.640]   something related to the verification system.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.320]   That's interesting.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.320]   Ant, are you not verified?
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.600]   I am not verified.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.200]   I tried--
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.480]   Let me see if I can reply to a tweet of yours.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:26.920]   If that works.
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:27.840]   I just tweet it.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.720]   I see, yes.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:38.120]   Can you reply?
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.440]   I'm trying right now.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.920]   Nope.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.000]   Let me see if I can retweet.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.280]   Yeah, if I was going to talk about that.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.720]   Can I retweet?
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.280]   I guess this is also stopped for the verified accounts
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.320]   they have.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.720]   Can retweet.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:54.280]   I could retweet.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.440]   Have scheduled tweets.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.400]   Right.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.680]   So somebody's--
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.000]   Andrew Barron asked an interesting question in Twitter.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.440]   He said, what do you think?
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.840]   Will Apple abandon Twitter?
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:07.560]   It's certainly not worth the reputational.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.920]   This is my point.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:10.760]   We're on Twitter.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.160]   But how valuable is Twitter?
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.120]   At what point is Twitter not valuable enough
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.520]   for the reputational damage?
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.240]   Or the risk that somebody might believe Apple tried--
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.040]   was going to double everybody's Bitcoin?
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.880]   I don't think Section 230--
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.480]   Those people are too dumb to be Apple customers now.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.800]   Apple customers are much smarter than that.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:34.760]   Much smarter than that.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.520]   Apple, did speaking of Apple, did
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.440]   win its Irish tax battle.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.160]   You may remember that--
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:41.840]   Big deal.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:46.040]   Marta Vistaya was really going against the tech companies
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.000]   because of the sweetheart deals they had made with various
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.120]   countries in the European Union.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.160]   Apple had a deal with Ireland that essentially would pay no
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.920]   income tax.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:00.400]   And so the European Union said, now, you owe--
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.200]   Apple, you owe $14.8 billion to Ireland, which it'll then
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:09.720]   pass on to us.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:13.360]   Apple took it to court, and the second highest court in the EU
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.160]   says, no, that's not true.
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:17.560]   That's bogus.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.560]   It said, in annulled the decision because the commission
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.040]   had failed to meet the legal standards
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.600]   in showing that Apple was illegally given special treatment.
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:28.400]   Often the case, cities do it too,
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.960]   where you get special tax breaks for the economic development
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.400]   you're bringing to a country.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.480]   Apple was using this as Google was in others
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:41.760]   to hide their income from the United States tax.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:44.800]   They would transfer intellectual property rights
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.240]   and other things to favorable nations.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.000]   Apple actually transferred a lot of the property rights
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.760]   for its products to Ireland, to a small division in Ireland.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.920]   All the income went into this Irish subsidiary,
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.200]   and there was no income tax.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.040]   The problem is, of course, it's offshore income.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.320]   Apple eventually did onshore all of that income
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.960]   when President Trump gave them a tax break.
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.800]   But it was--
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.680]   You had to bring this up on tax day, didn't you?
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.600]   Yeah, it is tax day, isn't it?
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.120]   Wow.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.520]   So Apple will save $14 billion in taxes.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.280]   You don't have to pay.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:23.920]   Meanwhile, people like me are still paying way more than Apple
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.960]   and it is way more than the percentage ones.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:27.960]   It's so annoying.
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:28.680]   Yep, it is.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:32.960]   So the Twitter wags are out like crazy.
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:35.760]   Rebecca Bon said, my fellow no checks, our time is now
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:39.400]   with Hamilton, Parker Higgins.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.240]   Cancel culture has gone too far.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:46.400]   It looks like Macworld was able to tweet
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.680]   from their verified account.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.840]   "Sellable way to shut down Trump's account."
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:56.680]   "Matt Cordini, the verified's were the virus.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.840]   Twitter is healing."
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:00.400]   That's interesting.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.720]   Is there a hashtag for that?
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.440]   No, there shouldn't be.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.120]   If it were in the hands of us privileged people,
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:07.880]   we would have thought of that Leo and had the hashtag,
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.320]   because that's kind of why we're privileged.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.600]   But these-- the mere masses here just
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.000]   don't know how to do Twitter.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.200]   Clearly, you people are Twitter and apt.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:17.960]   Ted, with it.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.640]   They're going to start burning you in effigy right now.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.200]   By the way, notice what the Jeff notice with the middle column
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.760]   in my tweet deck is, is your Jeff Jarvis's COVID list.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:27.360]   Woo, thank you, Leo.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.680]   Which I keep open all the time, because that's
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:32.320]   a very good source for real information.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.640]   Now up to-- so it's bit.ly folks.
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.000]   It's bitt.ly/covid-tweater-list.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.880]   And it's now up to more than 11,000 followers.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.840]   And the people on it are all epidemiologists,
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:48.320]   pharmacologists, pharmacologists, geneticists, biologists,
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.760]   infectious disease doctors, researchers,
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:53.040]   public health officials, and one or two journalists.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.480]   It's really a great source.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.760]   It's kind of--
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:57.360]   That is--
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.280]   It's amazing to watch.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280]   It's just amazing to watch science at work.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.280]   Oh, and then somebody's saying nobody will hack you,
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.760]   because you're not relevant in this century.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.720]   So Ben Collins at NBC, who's there--
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.480]   Ben is their security, you know, online guy.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.600]   So he's tweeting for a different account.
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.600]   Well, don't you have a backup account?
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.760]   In case of virus, break glass, surely you do.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.360]   That would be my secret, and I don't think you do.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.040]   I do.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.560]   I mean, it wasn't-- it's just I have--
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:31.200]   I have two other Twitter accounts that I can use.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.400]   But I don't have anything I need to say that badly.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.920]   So apparently, verified accounts are looking for single word
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.560]   tweets that they can retweet and stitch together to say things.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:47.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:47.920]   That's really fine.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:51.280]   I can't believe Mike Masnick is not verified.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.880]   Yeah, isn't it?
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.320]   Well, you know, it just shows you, right?
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.200]   It's just the--
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.000]   Just shows you.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:58.840]   It just shows you.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:55:59.680]   I have to be people verified.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.080]   Yeah, it doesn't mean nothing to have that blue check.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:08.720]   Roman Rhodes is a subway map.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.240]   I found this just amusing and enjoyable.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:13.880]   That's really great.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.560]   It is.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.520]   And my god, what a network.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:17.520]   No kidding.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.480]   It actually looks like a real subway map.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.560]   And many, by the way, if you go to Europe,
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.000]   many of these roads are still around.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.160]   Some of them are actually active.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.560]   Get a load of the logo on the lower left, SPQR.
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:33.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.440]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.440]   Shh, jump off.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.040]   Yes, that's--
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.200]   Do what now?
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:41.880]   Never mind.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.400]   It's--
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.480]   Yeah, I'm reading the Latin.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.240]   I'm reading the Latin.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.480]   I don't know where you're standing.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.680]   I got that.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:48.240]   Can Carson read Latin?
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.480]   Carson can speak Latin.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:50.960]   Sometimes--
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:51.960]   Carson can speak.
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.920]   Well, we don't want Ant to know what we're talking about.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.600]   We'll talk Latin around him.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.120]   No.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:58.920]   I'd be like--
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:01.920]   No.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.000]   Just say Zoom.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.480]   Just say Doom first.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.880]   And then I'll go ahead and tune in.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.760]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.880]   DS9 didn't tune in.
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.760]   I thought Ben Thompson had an excellent
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:18.480]   straticory piece on the TikTok war yesterday, in which he
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:18.480]   said--
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.000]   I didn't even say it was too big to hit.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:21.520]   It's good.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.880]   I can summarize it.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.280]   He's--
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.640]   I mean, it's pretty wide ranging, as often his thought is.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.200]   And he's always very insightful.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.800]   I mean, he gets Quibi in here and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:44.200]   But TikTok is very successful because humans
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.040]   prefer video to photos to text.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.440]   TikTok makes it easy to create videos.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:53.760]   And this is the key, ensuring a virtually infinite
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:57.800]   supply of content, even if most of its low,
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.000]   TikTok relies on the algorithm to surface the good stuff.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:06.120]   But also the interactivity of it, the collaboration.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:08.560]   I create a sound or I create a video and you get it on.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.960]   Well, that makes some fun.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.320]   And that's the fun part.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.320]   That's the fun part.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.200]   And that's where you get a lot of content.
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.320]   But then the algorithm is able to surface the best.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:19.560]   He says, that's exactly opposite Hollywood's model,
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.320]   which is that video is scarce because it's expensive to produce.
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.080]   So you've got to pick the hits ahead of time.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.440]   And that's where Quibi went wrong.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.120]   That's what Quibi's big disadvantage is.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.800]   Because it was big old Hollywood think.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.840]   As Carson says, oh, Ooby, Ooby, S me, see Booby.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.520]   That's a Booby.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.120]   Wow.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.880]   Where, oh, where has my little dog gone?
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.400]   I believe is the translation.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:50.120]   So he also talks about--
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:52.000]   he says, I cannot emphasize this point enough.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.800]   One of the gravest areas made by far too many people in the US.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.800]   And remember, Ben lives in Taipei.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:59.040]   He lives in Taiwan.
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.400]   He's taking an exceptionally self-centered view
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.920]   of US-China relations, where everything's
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.520]   about what the US says and does, while China is treated
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:10.080]   like an NPC, a non-player character.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.800]   It's insulting to China a great nation with a history far
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.200]   longer than the United States.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:18.680]   So he's giving a lot of credit to China's strategy.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.840]   And he describes what China's strategy is.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:24.320]   It's not military conquest.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.120]   And in fact, we've talked about that many times
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:27.440]   on all of our shows.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:34.640]   He quotes President Xi Jinping, the president for life
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:36.840]   of China, "Since the end of the Cold War,
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:38.640]   countries affected by Western values
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.160]   have been torn apart by war or afflicted with chaos.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.440]   If we tailor our practices to Western values,
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.280]   the consequences will be devastating.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:55.320]   We need to spread our way of life,
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.920]   because the competition in the ideological domain
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:59.800]   is fierce.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.760]   The very real threat of Western anti-China forces
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.960]   in their attempt at carrying out Westernization within China
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:11.440]   is an intense ideological struggle for survival."
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:15.520]   And by mentioning this, he says, so you
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:18.560]   have to understand TikTok is a Chinese company.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:26.680]   And of course, TikTok is vacuuming up as much data
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:29.360]   as it can from your usage to your IP address,
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:32.080]   to your contacts and location.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:36.840]   Similar to what Facebook does, he says,
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:38.240]   "But the differences emerge.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.800]   Facebook's a US company.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.760]   TikTok claims that it's independent from ByteDance
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.480]   and stores data in the US and Singapore.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:49.000]   But its privacy policy is clear.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.920]   One line that's all that matters.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.920]   We may share your information with a parent, subsidiary,
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.320]   or other affiliate of our corporate group.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.400]   Data it can and probably is being sent to China.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.320]   All Chinese internet companies are compelled
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.840]   by the country's national intelligence law
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:07.080]   to turn over any and all data the government demands.
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:08.520]   No warrants needed.
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.360]   Power is not limited by China's border."
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:17.360]   So he says, look, TikTok's great,
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.560]   but you probably shouldn't be using it.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.920]   It's time to take China seriously and literally.
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:27.320]   The Communist Party is not only ideologically opposed
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.640]   to liberalism.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.480]   That's the lower case L, the Western liberalism.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.160]   It believes that only one of liberalism or Marxism
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:37.040]   can prevail to that.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.840]   And it's been taking action for over 20 years
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.640]   to control information within its borders.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.720]   And over the last several years to control information
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:46.600]   outside its borders, it's time for the US
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:50.440]   to respond both on the government level and corporate level.
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:53.040]   And so he is--
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.280]   I think it's a fairly nuanced article.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.080]   It's well worth reading.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:01:59.080]   But he comes up at the end--
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.880]   Yeah, but I don't quite understand what should the response be.
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:02.440]   He says--
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:05.040]   --at the same time.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.120]   This is without a-- so he says, "Apple and Google
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.520]   can not only remove TikTok from the App Store.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.440]   They could, if ordered, make already installed apps
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.240]   unusable."
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.320]   And he says, "They should do it."
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:16.920]   He says--
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.720]   I was on-- they could not be ordered to.
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:21.760]   I was on--
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.000]   He says he would prefer Congress to order them to.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.240]   I was on with Ben Whittis and Kate Klannick
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.840]   who were two great legal lines, I know,
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.720]   for their podcast, "The In the Night."
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:38.200]   And they said, "No, government cannot take down TikTok."
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:38.720]   First Amendment.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.040]   Well, there's a couple of routes.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:43.120]   There's Cepheus, the Committee on Foreign Investment
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.840]   in the United States.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:47.320]   They can review by dances acquisition
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:50.840]   and musically, which was an American company.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.560]   There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:57.320]   Act, which would require declaring a national emergency.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:58.840]   Congress could--
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:02:59.840]   I don't know if first--
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:00.920]   Yeah, it's going to happen.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.360]   It's going to happen.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.200]   They're not taking--
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.680]   I was-- it was a paper tiger--
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.480]   Paper liar?
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.000]   Paper tiger.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.500]   Paper tiger.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:07.840]   That's the type--
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.920]   Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, he says--
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.880]   we're thinking about it.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:12.960]   We're mulling it over.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:15.600]   It's because we have to say, because that was the whole point.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.480]   The whole political thing right now
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.720]   is to distract us and think that the big issue in the world
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:22.320]   now is China.
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:25.720]   If China-- and again, this is Ben's point of view.
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:27.720]   I don't know if it's correct or not,
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.320]   but I think it's well reasoned.
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:32.760]   If China is on the offensive against liberalism,
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.040]   not only within its borders, but within ours,
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.120]   it's in liberalism's interest to cut off
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:40.560]   a vector that has taken root precisely because it is so
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.240]   brilliantly engineered to give humans exactly what they want.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:44.800]   But you're right.
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.080]   There may not be the legal precedent, the ability to do this.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:51.600]   But he says, if we can, we should order Apple and Google
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.280]   to take--
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:54.520]   We're going to look at this, though.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:58.160]   It has something akin to banning sugary sodas when New York
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.000]   tried to test that.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.680]   We're going to be like, are individual right to give our--
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.360]   No, I think Americans-- this would be a case, though.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:07.880]   Americans, let's face it, we can be a little chauvinistic.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.800]   I think Americans, it wouldn't be hard
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.480]   to get a consensus in America.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.800]   If you said, look, this is a Chinese app.
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:14.920]   It's spying on us.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:17.680]   It's an arm of the Chinese government.
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:19.600]   We should not-- it's dangerous to have it.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.640]   And a lot of companies, the US military, a lot of people
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.520]   are saying, no, you can't use TikTok.
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.680]   I could see that being supported by the American public.
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.680]   I could see Joe Biden even saying,
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.600]   he doesn't like Section 230.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.880]   We say things like, by American, but when
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:40.360]   we deal with our personal interests,
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.520]   we tend to backtrack on things like that.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:47.080]   But so there are a lot of TikTokers who'd be upset.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:51.560]   But they're mostly non-voters, I would guess.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:53.160]   So I don't know.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.560]   Sarah Cooper, we need Sarah Cooper for the democracy.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:56.040]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:57.760]   She's-- does the--
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.320]   does the--
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.320]   --lip-dub president?
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:04.520]   So I'm going to quote to you from Felippo Vistrada, 1474,
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:08.000]   which is writing about this, "A appeal
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.000]   to the doge of Venice for the scourge of printers.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.520]   They shamelessly print at a negligible price,
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:17.080]   material which may alas inflamable use,
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:19.000]   while a true writer dies of hunger,
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.840]   cure, if you will, the plague, which
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:23.960]   is doing away with the laws of all decency and curb
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:26.240]   the printers."
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:27.160]   We've been here before.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.840]   Yeah.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.840]   Yeah.
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:32.840]   But what we haven't been before is, on the surface,
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.240]   TikTok is a fun, enjoyable social network.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.760]   But what if it really is all about gathering in--
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:43.120]   as much information as possible about the American
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.080]   populace to what end?
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:44.560]   I don't know.
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.120]   I mean--
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.120]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.320]   So then, you know, it could be bad to what if--
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.880]   Well, I'll give you one example that Ben raises.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:58.520]   China is most certainly looking surveilling Chinese nationals
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.080]   in the United States with--
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.040]   Which they're doing already.
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:02.600]   So--
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:03.960]   And Chinese nationals believe me.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:06.040]   No, I've had them in classes.
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:09.160]   And they know even in a private class what not to say.
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:09.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:11.240]   Stacey, I think you're muted.
[02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:11.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.320]   And they're not on TikTok, probably, for--
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:14.820]   Right.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:15.840]   They're not.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.480]   Yeah, I bet you they're not.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:20.840]   We're doing trainings for media,
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.840]   like African-American media, Latino media, and so on,
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:27.520]   for the threats that exist against voting and stuff.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.800]   And Chinese media said, no, we don't need you.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.720]   We've been dealing with this for a long time.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.240]   So what--
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.240]   OK.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:33.760]   So--
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:36.440]   OK, so let's say that it would be inappropriate for the federal
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:40.920]   government to order Apple and Google to kick them out of the store.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:42.440]   Something, by the way, the Chinese government
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.040]   has done for ages to--
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.920]   Oh, yeah, but that's the difference between us.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:46.840]   We have a First Amendment.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:47.880]   So let's say--
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.640]   Could we-- would it be reasonable to have a campaign,
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:55.880]   a public campaign that says, stop using this as dangerous?
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:57.720]   Would you support that?
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.760]   No, because you don't really know what's dangerous.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.640]   It's by the way.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:04.960]   There is no substantial evidence that says, hey, this is dangerous,
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:07.760]   and you've got to be able to get the normal people to buy
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:08.880]   into that campaign.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:12.080]   And I don't think there's any way to get that to happen.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:12.800]   Well, certainly--
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.720]   We have evidence that vaccines work,
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:17.920]   but we still have a bunch of people who won't use them.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.560]   So all you need is to have people to cry conspiracy theory.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:22.760]   No, TikTok is a terrible.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:27.360]   And China would totally exploit that and then poof.
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.680]   Well, there are a lot of companies
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:31.040]   that are saying Wells Fargo, for instance, says,
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:33.280]   don't put that TikTok on our company phone.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:40.320]   How many companies phones are there in the world?
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:43.840]   What is the trend towards personal devices versus corporate
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:45.680]   issued devices now?
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:49.760]   I'm curious what the breakdown is in today's day and age.
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:52.400]   That was, of course, one of the big trends of the last 10
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:53.960]   years was BYOD.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:55.120]   BYOD?
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.600]   Got people bringing their own app because the iPhone--
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.840]   they didn't want the-- that really started when the company
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:04.440]   phone was a black barrier or a Windows CE device.
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:06.120]   And everyone wanted iPhones.
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.040]   And everyone wanted iPhones.
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:07.680]   I'm not using that.
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:08.680]   The CEO is like--
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.680]   --in those little six, maybe.
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.560]   Mm, I love that Windows mobile phone.
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:15.000]   Now, I did what I had.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000]   So at Fortune, for timing, I had to have--
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.080]   if I was going to use my phone as my primary device, which
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:26.360]   I wanted to, they required me to put software on it that
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.600]   was actually kind of dodgy.
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.760]   So I'll be honest.
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.520]   Oh, like AMD?
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:36.200]   Yeah, I took the Hillary route and used my personal device
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.040]   and email.
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.320]   Part of it was that Fortune took three weeks
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:42.800]   to get me an actual email address, which was a long time
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.400]   as a reporter, not to have email.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:46.360]   [LAUGHS]
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.800]   But yeah.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.200]   Speedy on board process.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:53.160]   The point being, I think there's lots of people
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.640]   using their personal devices.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.160]   I think these sort of things send a message that might
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:01.600]   influence people, but probably not the youths.
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.040]   Leo, you're going to be left to a point
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:04.800]   where you will have nothing left to quit.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.960]   Then what are you talking about?
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:07.400]   [LAUGHS]
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.280]   I mean, I like TikTok, but honestly, I don't think--
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.160]   I think the real risk to me for TikTok
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:15.320]   is it's a brain softener.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:17.200]   So I try to stay away from it.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:17.840]   But--
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.600]   It's just fun.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.600]   Yeah.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.080]   It's the kind of thing you just scroll on.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:24.560]   An hour later, you look up and you go, what happened?
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.120]   I lost it.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:26.560]   I never got anything out of it.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.800]   I see all of the trendy videos.
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.840]   But I never really got out of anything out of it.
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:35.520]   And then for me, the audience that I know I have,
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.240]   most of them don't tend to care about TikTok either.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.320]   Of course, Amazon famously sent out a letter saying,
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.600]   you can't use TikTok.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.520]   The security team sent that.
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:48.320]   And then Amazon realized that we do a lot of business
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.320]   with China.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.000]   And never mind.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.400]   Never mind.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:54.440]   We didn't say that.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:56.120]   It was on prime videos.
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:59.640]   Actually, advertised is on TikTok.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:05.920]   So it's probably a very good advertising platform, right?
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:09.040]   Profit matters, baby.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:15.480]   I am not a fan of jingoism, of anti-Chinese racism,
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:16.840]   by any means.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.360]   I love it.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:18.800]   Chinese government sucks.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.720]   You're right.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:20.560]   I don't trust--
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.640]   Yeah, the Chinese government.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.800]   No, I don't either.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:23.800]   I don't either.
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:26.760]   But I think their goals are not militaristic with us.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.760]   They might be Taiwan and Hong Kong.
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:30.640]   But they are certainly economic with us.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.000]   Yeah.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.320]   But here's the problem with that way of thinking, right?
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.280]   Is that a lot of people in the world don't trust America right now.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.760]   Well, we're in the same boat.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.960]   In fact, we just found out that, oh, the CIA's
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:44.160]   been hacking those other guys just as much.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.360]   That's, of course, it's a two-way street.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:49.680]   In fact, the problem I always had with cyber warfare
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:52.120]   is once you start doing it, it opens the door for everybody
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:52.920]   to do it.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.920]   And that's really a bad situation.
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:57.000]   It's the kind of thing like chemical warfare.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.320]   Honestly, I think should be banned by a Geneva convention
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.560]   because it's damaging to all parties.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:07.480]   And it's not-- it's an easy thing to do.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:09.240]   It's a cheap thing to do.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.680]   Doesn't cost as much as one missile, one cruise missile.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:20.200]   But I think I lost that battle a couple of decades ago.
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.280]   All right.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.600]   Maybe.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.040]   I still can't tweet.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.800]   Jeff still can't tweet.
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.000]   But you know what we can do?
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.440]   We don't know.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:31.000]   Coming up next.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.480]   It's time for our picks of the week.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.560]   I'm muzzled.
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.720]   So many people would love to do this.
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:41.680]   Why don't we start with you, Stacey, for your pick of the week.
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:44.360]   Well, this is brought about by the Google Ingram
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.720]   discussion.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:46.760]   You may have read this.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.800]   It's not a new article, but I read it a couple--
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.280]   I think I stumbled upon it a couple of days ago, maybe.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:54.920]   And I was fascinated by it.
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.520]   Did I put it in there?
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:59.120]   Where is our picks of the week?
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:01.000]   This thing just keeps scrolling.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.240]   You did not put it in there.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.080]   It's not in there.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.160]   Otherwise, I'd be showing it right now.
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:05.840]   I know.
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.600]   I'm like, where is this blank?
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.160]   Stacey's thing is blank.
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.720]   I'm getting-- I'm going, you guys.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:12.640]   Here I am.
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.080]   OK.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.560]   I'm so not awesome.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:16.040]   OK.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:16.880]   I see it now.
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.920]   This is nine words formed by mistakes.
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:23.000]   And this is a Merriam-Webster article
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.960]   about how we got these words.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.240]   And most of them actually come from the same thing.
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:28.760]   Wait a minute.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.240]   Apron is a mistake?
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:31.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:37.240]   So it finally explained to me why orange is such a different word
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:38.800]   than it is in French.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:39.840]   Because you can't rhyme anything with orange.
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:45.200]   Well, in French and in Spanish, it is neuron-han Spanish.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.080]   And I can't remember what the heck it is in French.
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:49.600]   Oh, no, in French it's Laurent.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:50.840]   Oh, it's Laurent-han.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:51.880]   I thought it.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:52.000]   Yeah.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.880]   But the Spanish, I was always like, why is it neuron-han?
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:58.840]   And then reading this, it tells you.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:02.960]   If the Arabic word is "Naranj" passed in French
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.680]   through an old Aksatan, which spelled the word "Oranj"
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:07.840]   I love this stuff.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.960]   Which originally ultimately became orange in modern French.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.360]   The N vanished because the indefinite articles
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.640]   in French, "un" and "all," and with an N sound,
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:19.000]   and the word was re-spilled accordingly,
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.160]   dropping the initial N.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.840]   Oh, so that's why there's an N in "Naranj" but not in "Oranj."
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:29.440]   Exactly.
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.760]   And a lot of these became the indefinite article
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.520]   kind of got in the way.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.640]   That's the-- if I were to sum up this article,
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:43.360]   this article, it would be your "la" or "un" or whatever
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:47.040]   became truncated.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.360]   So I just thought this was kind of neat for people
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:50.600]   who like words.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:56.440]   In middle English, the word "eek" meant also or an addition.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:59.280]   So a secondary or unofficial name in the late middle ages
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.560]   was an "eek" name, also name.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:10.280]   It eventually became a "nique" name, a "nique" name.
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.160]   "Nach" comes from the French word "oash,"
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.720]   an incision made to keep a record.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.440]   But when the word migrated, the article "an"
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:22.760]   got in the mix, and "anosh" became a "nach."
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:23.760]   See?
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.760]   I love it.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:25.280]   I love it.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:25.760]   So, OK.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.600]   Thank you, Mary and Webster.
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.560]   There it is.
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:29.240]   Fun for y'all.
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.240]   So the word for "apron" is another one of those French
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:34.720]   to English things.
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:36.680]   The word for a cloth covering in middle French
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:42.760]   was "naparron," which came from "nap," meaning tablecloth.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:45.880]   "naparron" came into English in the 14th century,
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:50.280]   but referring it to it in English as an "apron"
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.080]   led to some people spelling it as an "apron" instead.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:58.280]   So it really is a "naparron," but you can call it an "apron."
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:14:59.080]   That is so cool.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:14:59.480]   Yeah.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.000]   I love it.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:00.880]   I love the language.
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:01.280]   Yeah.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:03.720]   Scooter Ritz had the best question in Chateau.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:04.280]   What's that?
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.880]   What are orange is called in Spain?
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   "Nara ha."
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.200]   I don't know what color are they in Spain.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:12.480]   Oh, what color are they?
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.920]   Oh.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:14.480]   Oh, that's good.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:15.640]   I don't know.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.280]   What color is the orange?
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:18.720]   What would they describe it?
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.320]   What is the Spanish color of orange?
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.760]   No, it's the same.
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:25.560]   "Nara ha."
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:26.480]   "Nara ha."
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.680]   Is the color is "nara ha" as well as the fruit.
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.000]   The citrus fruit is also "nara" on ha, isn't it?
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.320]   Yes.
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:35.840]   OK.
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:36.480]   Yeah.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.600]   That's pretty cool.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:39.800]   Thank you, Google Translate.
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:41.960]   My little fluent Spanish speaker running around
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]   who always makes fun of me.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.040]   She's like, yo, care, OK, so--
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:49.360]   Your care, OK, so I wanted to pick.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:52.000]   How about that?
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.280]   What's your pick of the weekend?
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:58.760]   My pick, 16 weeks ago, however long
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:01.240]   you spent when all of this shelter in place started,
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:03.960]   I said I wanted to just sort of chronicle
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.520]   how we're going about this from a production standpoint.
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.440]   So on Instagram, my Instagram account, anti-discord Pruitt,
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:13.600]   I started a highlight.
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:18.040]   And it's basically given you a behind the scenes look of everything
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:21.480]   we've been dealing with from the beginning.
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:22.800]   And I show you just--
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.800]   What'd you find out?
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:25.840]   --is it ready for the show, getting ready for guest
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:28.360]   appearance, setting up the studio.
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.800]   I mean, it's a lot of stuff in there.
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.720]   And then there is also a free phone wallpaper highlight
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:36.240]   right there available to people too.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:39.960]   If you want some images for your phone as a wallpaper,
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:42.200]   you can just click there.
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:44.000]   But yeah, that's my pick.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.720]   Follow me over there and check out that story.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:48.120]   It's a lot of--
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.120]   You're going to have to add my new mask fitters
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.880]   to your COVID-19 response.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.040]   Yeah, we got to do that.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:55.800]   Yeah, let's do that.
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:56.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.240]   Because I think that's--
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:00.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:02.440]   I think that's a big part of the story.
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:07.720]   I said before the show, this is the mask for idiots.
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:09.440]   I'm breathing on you.
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:13.000]   Now, this is that 3D thing I designed.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.320]   This is a finely cane.
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:15.720]   Does it fit well?
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:16.920]   Yeah, it fits my face perfectly.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:18.920]   Sure it looks perfectly.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:24.000]   And it works quite well as a--
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.560]   its job is to be a fitter, so you put it over cloth.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.600]   That looks sanitary.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:32.520]   And then it's a perfect seal.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:38.080]   That looks like it works.
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:40.920]   Yeah, it's a little dusty.
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:43.000]   Yeah, I don't know if I would have put that on my face.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.080]   Yeah, right over your mouth.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:44.600]   I don't know.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.280]   But where does that bit, Leo?
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:49.440]   Well, no, this has got a very clever little attachment
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:51.920]   to keep it off my mouth, actually.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:52.440]   See that?
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:53.400]   It's like little handle.
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:54.840]   Where's the rag thing?
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.480]   Oh, the rag.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.120]   Oh, this is what we clean up with.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.080]   Yeah, I wouldn't.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:05.040]   I've been wearing a bandana around my neck when I go out.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:06.680]   And I just--
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:07.040]   That's true.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.000]   Because that way--
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.160]   Even a simple cloth mask.
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.120]   I have a bunch of those too, but--
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:14.960]   If you could believe--
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:15.880]   People would just do it.
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:21.440]   Discredited former doctor epidemiologist Fauci.
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:24.800]   So there was-- in the 1918 in San Francisco,
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:27.280]   there was an anti-- like 24,000 people
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.080]   belong to an anti-mask group.
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:29.600]   Yes.
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:30.800]   Until people died.
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.800]   So no, Facebook didn't make us stupid.
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.200]   We were already stupid.
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:35.600]   We were already stupid.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.880]   Facebook just weaponized it.
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:40.880]   All right, we got to wrap this up so I can go listen to Hands
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.040]   On Wellness because I'm super excited.
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:42.880]   Oh, that's great.
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:43.400]   Well, that's good.
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:45.480]   That's got a number of the week from Jeff Jarvis.
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:46.360]   All right, I got two of them.
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:47.360]   So we got Quibi.
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.520]   This is your Schadenfreude moment.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:50.520]   Yeah.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:55.720]   We signed up 910,000 users and 72,000 stuck around.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.000]   They lost 90%.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.760]   Meanwhile, over Disney, the company that can't apparently
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.800]   lose, even if it opens up with the theme chart
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:09.000]   parks when it shouldn't, Hamilton resulted in a 641% increase.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.480]   And that surprised.
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:11.280]   Not surprised.
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:12.760]   But that's going to be the same problem
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.080]   at the end of the month because they paid $699 for the first
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:17.160]   month.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.720]   But then will they pay $699?
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:21.000]   Disney's probably not going to tell those numbers.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.440]   No, I'm surprised we have the Quibi numbers.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.440]   Where did that come from?
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:26.240]   Probably not.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.800]   Yeah, since we're not from Quibi.
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:28.640]   Not from Quibi.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.720]   It's not from Quibi.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:30.560]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:33.200]   And I don't know exactly how sensitive tower knows that stuff
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.480]   or how accurate those numbers are.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:36.120]   I'll bet though.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:40.960]   It's time for Carsten's mask of the week.
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:44.440]   And actually, we have several of you.
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.160]   This is the mask of the future.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:51.680]   It is a mask that can translate and transcribe for you.
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:57.760]   I don't think it's a concept.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:00.320]   It's from Design Boom.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:03.440]   I want one that has the LED lights that make your skin
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.400]   better while you sleep under them.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:08.560]   Yeah, this is my Japanese startup,
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.960]   the aptly named Donut Robotics.
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.280]   It can record conversations, transcribe them
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.480]   into text messages via Bluetooth,
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.120]   and translate Japanese into eight languages, English,
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:21.000]   Chinese, French, Korean, Thai,
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.360]   Bahasa, Spanish, and Vietnamese.
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:25.240]   You can also use the make calls.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.560]   And to amplify your voice,
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:30.680]   so it's like a little megaphone.
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:34.680]   And Asian nations say they made fun of us for our masks.
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:36.160]   Nah, you just watched.
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:38.200]   Well, this is from a crowdfunding site,
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:40.240]   but I and John,
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:41.520]   Jeremy Beast, John Slanina,
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:43.280]   brought this to my attention.
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.200]   And I have ordered this.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.080]   This is from Kickstarter.
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:50.840]   It's UV mask, a real time UVC filtration.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.320]   Meet UV mask.
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:53.520]   Oh, shut up.
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:57.960]   U-T-U-V-C filtration and purification face mask.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:02.120]   It has a battery in it and a USB charger.
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:07.040]   It has a USB, sorry, UV-C light in it.
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:12.040]   So air goes in, the sterile vortex is sanitized,
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:16.040]   and then passed back out.
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:19.520]   So it both protects the wearer and the people around them.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:23.240]   It also has a replaceable air filter.
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.920]   And they have raised $1.3 million
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.240]   out of their $20 million.
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.960]   You got about two years after we have a vaccine.
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.160]   Well, I know, I know, but for the next one, I'll be ready.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:34.360]   And the other thing they don't mention,
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:36.880]   I wonder how much this thing weighs.
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:38.880]   Yeah, it looks like it's pretty 50.
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:41.080]   Got my card to keep my head up.
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:43.320]   It's got dual filtration.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:47.200]   They say 99.99% purified air.
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:50.400]   Is that wild or what?
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:51.880]   But that's not all.
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.000]   But wait, there's more,
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.760]   'cause Carsten also has,
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.600]   well, this is a mask you found, Jeff.
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:21:59.840]   Yes, I did.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:02.320]   This is from an artist.
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:09.320]   Oh, it is, that goes with the Holy Hand grenade.
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:14.680]   This is a liturgical mask made from recycled brass
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:19.520]   and other materials ideal for large perceptions.
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.520]   So I imagine the bishop,
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.320]   we'll get one of these for Father Robert,
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.160]   the Bishop of Robert.
[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:28.280]   Percy, I think is like the Bishop of Canterbury or something.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:32.320]   Oh, this is actually, he's actually gonna wear it?
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:36.240]   Well, he's a real priest.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:37.760]   He's a real bishop.
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:40.200]   Is he an archbishop or a bishop?
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:41.040]   I don't know, it's good for him.
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:44.640]   I think only archbishop should be allowed to wear this mask.
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:45.480]   Look, Nancy mask.
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:49.640]   He's the dean of Christchurch University of Oxford.
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:52.480]   I have promoted him considerably.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.120]   Well, still a big deal.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.520]   Oh, the dean of Christchurch is pretty good.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:58.680]   So-- Isn't that a city?
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:22:59.920]   No, no.
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:01.440]   Well, it might be-- Oxford is.
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:04.720]   It's a, yeah, it's a college.
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:07.040]   Well, I know, but it's also a city in New Zealand.
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:09.240]   It is a city in New Zealand.
[02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:10.080]   You're right.
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:10.920]   This is Oxford.
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:12.080]   And you are in Mississippi.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.640]   So smart.
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:14.480]   So I'm gonna give you--
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:15.560]   In Mississippi.
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:16.880]   I'm gonna give you two,
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:21.960]   Oxford is a city in Mississippi, that's correct.
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.800]   That's right.
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:24.520]   Yachnapatatha County.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.680]   Can I do one or no?
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.840]   I'll do a simple one.
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:30.120]   I was gonna do a serious one.
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:31.320]   This is a light one.
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:34.120]   This is a website called Windows,
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.120]   I'm sorry, window singular dash swap.com.
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.160]   And you just go to this site and you click the button
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.520]   and it'll give you a new live video
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:48.240]   out of Windows somewhere in the world.
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:49.720]   Including-- Oh, can I submit one?
[02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:50.920]   Yeah.
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:52.480]   Including sound.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.800]   Yeah, so--
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:56.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:23:56.380 --> 02:23:58.520]   So that's--
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:00.040]   So everybody have their whip hands to this.
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:00.880]   That's in Dubai.
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.060]   Here's Israel.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:04.840]   Isn't that--
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:06.600]   (engine revving)
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:08.520]   This is taking me back to the city.
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.400]   Is it window?
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:12.240]   The kitty.
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:13.080]   The kitty.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:13.920]   The kitty.
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:16.520]   Window dash, window dash swap.com.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:17.360]   Oh, okay.
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:18.840]   That's Rochester, New York.
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:21.600]   I think these are actually clips.
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:22.440]   Yeah.
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.680]   I don't think they're live.
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:25.680]   That's a little disappointing,
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:26.520]   'cause look, she's--
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.040]   It feels like you submit your--
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:30.280]   So we'll get this panning and stuff.
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:31.680]   Okay, yeah.
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.520]   But I do love it.
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:33.360]   That's pretty.
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:34.600]   Oh, it's Germany.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:37.120]   Oh, it's a 10 minute horizontal HD video
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:38.560]   of your window and frame with your name
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:39.400]   and location for credit.
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:41.440]   So you need to submit a 10 minute video.
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:42.640]   I do like the clouds moving.
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:46.160]   Germany is the cleanest of all the countries.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.680]   This is Glasgow, Scotland.
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:50.920]   The greenest of all the countries.
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:52.960]   Here's Wales.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.800]   Scotland.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:54.640]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:56.280]   There was a palm tree in Wales?
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:58.160]   Yeah, I thought that was odd.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.640]   But maybe.
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:01.280]   Someone's lying.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:05.200]   This is Hyderabad in India.
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.040]   I like this idea.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:07.440]   It's a beautiful composition.
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:09.160]   Well, that's-- you know what?
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:10.840]   It's kind of a natural, because if you're shooting
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:14.000]   through a window, you've kind of got this frame.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.040]   It's framed.
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.960]   Yeah, so it's kind of--
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.520]   this one is apparently on the guy's bed.
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:19.440]   Oh, it's not so good.
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:20.840]   Yeah, it's not the composition.
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:22.040]   It's not such a good composition.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.080]   That's such a good composition.
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:26.640]   That was the Burt Cam, when New York.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:27.680]   Yeah, these are not live.
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.160]   I thought they were live originally.
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.160]   But now that I look at them,
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:33.040]   I sense it.
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:34.320]   You'd have your moment of Jenny Cam.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:35.120]   It's a clip.
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:38.120]   Yeah, it's a little Jenny Cam, isn't it?
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:39.640]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.480]   Stacey has to go and get well by watching.
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.880]   I want to check out this show.
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:46.760]   I feel so sad that I didn't know it existed.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:47.600]   Well, it's brand new.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:48.480]   It's like in my wheelhouse.
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:49.280]   But it's brand new.
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.280]   It's only a couple of months old.
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:52.440]   So you haven't missed a lot.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:54.640]   Oh, look, you can almost see my plant.
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.520]   There.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.520]   There's her plants.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:57.200]   There you go.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:58.120]   It's a lot.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:25:59.440]   It's behind me.
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:01.320]   It's a seven out of 10.
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:03.080]   Seven.
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:04.360]   What don't you like about it?
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:06.560]   Got to balance the screen here.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.160]   I think that's pretty nice.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.080]   He does have a thing for bookshelves, Mr.
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:13.360]   Ratelice Skyburn.
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.320]   See, that's why I gave Jeff 10.
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:16.720]   Is he verified?
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:18.080]   That's the standard over there.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.360]   That's the standard right there.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.520]   That's the gold standard.
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:23.840]   See, I feel that that's pretty old school, though.
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:26.000]   I mean, like--
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:26.920]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:28.720]   It is not very modern.
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.320]   It's what I expect.
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:32.280]   I'm getting some pineapples.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.240]   Pineapples, Steve.
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:35.760]   I expect them.
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:37.280]   Do you want real pineapples fast?
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:37.760]   Pineapples fast.
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:39.280]   Pineapples.
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:41.640]   So Steve Schmidt and John Heilman
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.760]   have a Ratelice Skyburn war going on.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:44.800]   Oh.
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:46.200]   And they escalate.
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:47.040]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:48.600]   And they live in beautiful places.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:49.360]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.680]   And they put the fruit bowls behind them.
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:54.400]   So now you're at both Schmidt and Heilman
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.560]   are at three pineapples each.
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:59.480]   You know, that explains a lot, because I know
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.320]   in Steve's room getting more and more ornate.
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.760]   Now I understand what there's actually something going on.
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:08.200]   That's his--
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:11.000]   Heilman was in his kitchen for a long time.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:11.440]   Yes.
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.640]   And then he went out to the living room.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.480]   Then he went outside.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.120]   By the way, Heilman has two gigantic amazing dogs
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:20.120]   that occasionally appear.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:26.640]   So this is a room raider at Ratelice Skyburns.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:27.440]   Stangles.
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:28.440]   That's another view of stangles.
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.400]   It's very nice.
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:29.880]   Very nice.
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.440]   That's a fancy New York apartment.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:32.440]   I can tell.
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:34.320]   No pineapples.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320]   But there are fruit bowls.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:37.080]   There are fruit bowls.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:38.440]   Keep going to get some pineapples.
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:38.960]   Yeah.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.680]   Oh my goodness.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:43.640]   Color game is strong with this one.
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:44.800]   Frames too small.
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:45.280]   See this?
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:48.160]   I think this is like what they would say about Stacey.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:48.720]   Here it is.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.000]   The tiny bookshelf.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.640]   Nothing on the-- yeah, it's not balanced.
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:53.760]   Yeah, it's a 600-inch.
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:54.800]   Hey!
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:56.120]   Hey!
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:58.160]   We love real brick.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:27:58.760]   Not fogant.
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:27:59.600]   Not a 10 there.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.040]   But then notice that prominent plant and the balance.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.360]   Yeah, balance.
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:07.440]   Yeah, the lamp and the plant balance each other.
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:07.920]   Simple.
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.960]   Here you got the frames and the mirror.
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.440]   Very nice.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:10.960]   Very nice.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:10.960]   Very nice.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.360]   And a 10.
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.680]   Oh, got a left tire of banks.
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:15.880]   Yeah.
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:16.800]   Seven out of 10, though.
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:18.680]   She spoke to the inspector more of her.
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:20.920]   Well, it's the chandelier that's really bringing it down.
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.960]   And what the hell is this thing?
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.520]   Is that a--
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.040]   A lamp?
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:28.040]   It's a good joke.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.840]   I love Jason Johnson.
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:31.240]   And he hasn't been on for a while.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:33.440]   He just returned today, which is a great thing.
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:34.760]   Jason, he's wonderful.
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:37.920]   So he's got as tight a frame as I do.
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:39.560]   And you only see a little bit.
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.360]   In the floating bookshelfs, he got eight out of 10.
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:43.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:43.920]   But he doesn't--
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:45.120]   Does he want to help you here?
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:46.720]   He's trying to help you, Stacey.
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:47.400]   Yeah.
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:48.400]   I know.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:51.040]   You got to take the help.
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:51.960]   Zero out of 10.
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:53.040]   Pretty Patel.
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.040]   No, sorry.
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.040]   Mm-mm.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:56.280]   0.0 point.
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:57.280]   What is that?
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:58.280]   An elevator you're sitting in front of?
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:28:59.560]   What the hell?
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.920]   What is that?
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:02.040]   This is nice.
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:03.120]   Charlie's got a good one there.
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:04.840]   He's got a mantle piece.
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:05.880]   Oh, it's very nice.
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:07.920]   It's a nice picture of a dog.
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:08.920]   A dog.
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:09.920]   Yeah.
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:10.960]   Yeah.
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:13.280]   The picture of your dog, Stacey, would help a lot.
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:13.800]   There you go.
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:15.720]   You don't have to have a dog, just a picture of a dog.
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:16.720]   Picture him.
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:18.480]   I like this one.
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:19.880]   He only got seven, though.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:21.560]   Well, they don't like the light here coming up.
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:23.400]   The lighting, yeah.
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:24.640]   That's why we got to get ants.
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:27.160]   Your lighting tips.
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:30.440]   Was that in the COVID-19, Reg?
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:31.440]   It's in there.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:32.440]   Wait, here's a 10 out of 10.
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:33.440]   Scroll down.
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:34.440]   I want to see this one.
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:35.440]   OK.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.720]   10 out of 10 for Victor Blackwell.
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:38.720]   I disagree.
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:39.720]   His head's cut off.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:40.720]   Yeah, I know.
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.720]   I agree.
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:43.480]   You got to click on the actual picture, right?
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:44.480]   Oh, yeah.
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:45.480]   Right.
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:46.480]   OK.
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:47.480]   Oh, that's quite nice.
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:48.480]   Very funny.
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.480]   Frame to bank notes.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:50.480]   A little weird.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:55.480]   Things framed, yeah.
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:56.480]   That's nice.
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.480]   Oh, yeah, that's nice.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.480]   Yeah.
[02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:02.640]   I'm going to miss this voyeurism when it's gone.
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:03.640]   I know.
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:07.600]   Oh, this is interesting doing the off-centered piece.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:08.600]   Beautiful chair off-center.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:09.600]   That's 60 minutes.
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:10.600]   That is courageous.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:15.000]   It is in decreas-- Stacy, look at that nice big plant.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000]   Yeah.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000]   See what that does?
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.000]   I don't buy a freaking plant.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000]   You don't have to buy a plant.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.680]   You have limited funds after moving.
[02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.680]   I think it means--
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.840]   And you want me to go buy a fancy clean.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:24.840]   The queen's zoom.
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:26.840]   She at least learned not to wear a green dress.
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:27.840]   That's a good start.
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:28.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:29.840]   That's right.
[02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:30.840]   I forgot that.
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:33.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:35.840]   I don't know.
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:36.840]   OK.
[02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:37.840]   Rembrandt's birthday.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:40.360]   I don't know what's going on there.
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:45.960]   So I don't know how we got down this rat hole, which we've gotten down many times before.
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:46.960]   It's Jeff's favorite.
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.920]   He's today and going down this rat hole.
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.280]   I'm so proud of myself.
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:51.520]   You know why it's his favorite?
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:52.520]   Because he got 10 out of 10.
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:53.520]   He got 10 out of 10.
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:54.520]   He's proud of himself.
[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:55.520]   I believe it.
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:59.480]   I mean, Jeff is the quintessential professorial study.
[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:00.480]   It makes sense.
[02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:01.480]   Yep.
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:02.480]   My wife was very--
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:05.760]   What you don't see is my amazing rug.
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:08.320]   Yeah, we need to see your rug.
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.120]   Put it on the wall, Stacy.
[02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:12.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:16.920]   Ooh, I like this.
[02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:17.920]   What the hell?
[02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:18.920]   There's a cat tail.
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:19.920]   What?
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.920]   Hunt them all.
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:21.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:24.920]   I'm going to take that seriously.
[02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:25.920]   That is.
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:30.040]   He pushes the cat down.
[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:31.040]   That's hysterical.
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:33.720]   Oh my god.
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:34.720]   That was very--
[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:41.880]   That's a cat tail covering his face entirely.
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.360]   Perfectly positioned.
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.120]   And that's a really nice cat tail.
[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:46.480]   It's a nice cat tail.
[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:47.480]   It's a beauty.
[02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:48.480]   It's a beauty.
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:49.480]   It's a beauty.
[02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:50.960]   That's a big cat right there.
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:55.840]   And you could tell he's British and still stiff, so the cat tail really adds to it.
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:56.840]   I love it.
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.840]   I love it.
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:31:58.840]   I love it.
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:00.840]   All right, that wraps--
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:02.920]   My money is on that the cat knows.
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:05.840]   The cat-- oh, cats always know.
[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:07.640]   Cats always know.
[02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:12.000]   Mary Jo Fully finally had to banish her cat when she does Windows Weekly, because Srirachi
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.200]   would actually come and unplug the computer.
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:18.720]   Like, no, I'm not having this.
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:21.280]   And she would-- I mean, it was amazing.
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:23.560]   So she had to banish her.
[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:24.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:25.960]   All right, everybody.
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:26.960]   We've--
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:27.960]   All right.
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:31.000]   We more than out worn are welcome, but I am so glad you decided to be.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000]   Well, we do.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000]   That's just what we do.
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:36.160]   We never end a show till it's driven deep into the ground.
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:39.800]   And there's a stake through its heart.
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:41.800]   Because why not?
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.240]   Thank you, Stacy, Higginbotham.
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:45.400]   Are you going to be here next, Stacy?
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:46.400]   I am.
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:47.400]   Oh, good.
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:48.400]   I know.
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:50.440]   Now, the gauntlet has been thrown down to Stacy.
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:51.440]   I predict--
[02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:52.440]   I will stay.
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:53.440]   Next week.
[02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:54.440]   Next week.
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:55.440]   You complained about my blinds.
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:56.440]   I fixed the blinds.
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:57.440]   No, no.
[02:32:57.440 --> 02:32:58.440]   This is what I would do.
[02:32:58.440 --> 02:32:59.680]   OK, just saying.
[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:02.200]   A nice rubber plant in front of those blinds--
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:03.200]   Ah.
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:04.200]   Yes, exactly.
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:05.200]   --would be perfect.
[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:10.800]   That's where my little shredder and hero in recycling bid is.
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:11.800]   Oh.
[02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:13.480]   You put a little shelf there, put the plant on top.
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:14.480]   Put a shelf in.
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:16.080]   Stacy, while we're at it, while we're at it--
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:17.080]   I don't know.
[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:19.360]   I don't know if the paperclip is going to--
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:21.320]   is that going to be permanent now?
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.400]   No, I just--
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:23.840]   I--
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:25.120]   just go.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:25.920]   Don't listen to me, Dan.
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:26.920]   Just go.
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:28.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:31.360]   Stacy at IOT.com, that's a website.
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:33.040]   Sign up for the newsletter.
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:34.640]   Listen to her podcast.
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:35.960]   It's audio only so you want to--
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:36.440]   Oh, sorry.
[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.040]   --but I haven't enjoyed it too much, Stacy.
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:39.040]   I'm sorry.
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.200]   That's a great show with-- she does with Kevin Tofol.
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:42.960]   It's all Stacy at IOT.com.
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:44.560]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:47.680]   That bad boy is celebrating his birthday, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.600]   He's got a giant--
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:50.400]   I got a little license today, right?
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:51.400]   Who?
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:53.560]   Actually, because I'm on a damn sugar high after I've
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:54.480]   been eating some of this stuff.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:55.600]   Oh, man, I'm so jealous.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:58.880]   That cake looked really good.
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:00.400]   Hey!
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:01.800]   Who stole your--
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:04.440]   somewhere your credit card is gone.
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:06.480]   Did I read your credits from?
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:06.920]   I don't know.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:08.600]   I don't know who the hell is.
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:10.920]   He's a professor of--
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:12.240]   oh, man.
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:14.960]   Tau Knight, professor of journalism
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:17.280]   at the Craig Do-Mark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.400]   at the City University of New York.
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:20.120]   How's that?
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:21.600]   Close enough.
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.080]   He's a big shot there.
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:26.200]   But I still can't tweak Buzzmachine.com.
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:28.440]   And he still can't tweak because he's a blue check.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:30.720]   That's how important he is.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:33.120]   Thank you so much for being here, Jeff.
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:33.880]   Happy birthday.
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:35.280]   I hope you do something fun.
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.240]   [GRUNTING]
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:40.600]   I know, I know, anything with the 6 in front of it,
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.120]   there's only one thing worse, something
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.120]   with the 7 in front of it.
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:47.640]   Well, at that point-- the 7, I say, I'm happy I made it.
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:48.480]   Yeah.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:50.200]   The 6, I just say what doesn't work.
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.040]   Yeah, we just don't know.
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:52.200]   Why are we making fun of it?
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:54.720]   I mean, we've talked about how crisp and clear Ant is,
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:57.720]   but we are not mocking his lack of anything.
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.440]   So there is only one thing I would say about Ant, which
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:03.880]   is it does look like the camera and the lighter
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:06.200]   aimed at your ear holes.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:07.320]   So this time that they are--
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.440]   I maybe would go with something a little less aggressive.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:12.080]   Normally they're a little bit lower.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:12.800]   Yeah.
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:13.440]   Yeah.
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:14.200]   That's OK.
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:14.960]   I like it.
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.200]   It's a beautiful picture.
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:18.120]   Honestly, you could take the cameras out.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:20.120]   It would still be a great picture.
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:21.240]   So the lighting is--
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:21.960]   Yeah, it's just like--
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.520]   Because your lighting is amazing.
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.200]   I'm just pointing out that you know--
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:28.520]   Nice try-- nice try to deflect there, Stacey.
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:29.520]   Didn't work.
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.360]   Why is there a different standard for Ant?
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:34.960]   Because Ant is the man.
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:35.480]   Yeah, try.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:36.840]   Yeah, Stacey, sorry.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.640]   Sorry.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:39.240]   You're just Stacey.
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.640]   So if I did nothing and had crisper lighting,
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:44.480]   would I be absolved?
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:46.000]   Actually, yes.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.280]   If you had perfect lighting and then the background
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:52.880]   was a little blurred out, it'd be perfect.
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:55.920]   Although I do think a plant would be nice in front of that.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:57.760]   I just-- poor Andrew is going to say,
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:58.600]   you're going to buy a plant.
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:35:59.400]   Why?
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:00.480]   Oh, yeah, don't listen to me.
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:02.480]   Well, because I can't just buy a plant.
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:04.560]   I have to buy a plant or a plant.
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:06.960]   Now I've humiliated Ant.
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:09.320]   He's moving the camera.
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:09.960]   Yeah.
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.040]   I do love that light.
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.360]   What is the story with that light?
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:13.040]   Oh, these are light.
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:13.840]   The light's good.
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:14.560]   The light's good.
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.320]   The light looks like a production now.
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.560]   Keep the light in.
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:19.200]   It's just that adds a mystery to it.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:20.400]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:21.000]   Yeah.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.080]   Just trying to create--
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:23.080]   That's good.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.000]   Yeah, that's what you're doing.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.360]   That's what you're doing.
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:27.360]   Yeah, that's good.
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:29.080]   Because the light's just a little lot of focus.
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:29.600]   It's perfect.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:30.160]   It looks good.
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:33.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:35.880]   But you could use a plate sitting on one of that thing
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:36.400]   is bad.
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:37.120]   Another hair line over there.
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:39.560]   Ant will be talking about this on hands-on photography
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:40.680]   every week.
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.000]   And of course, hands-on wellness at twit.tv.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:43.520]   Twit.
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.020]   Twit.
[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:44.520]   Twit.
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:45.020]   Twit.
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:47.560]   We chose into the ground into a bloody--
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:47.560]   Oh, OK.
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.480]   --we are never done until--
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:51.960]   --still spacey stuff.
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:52.960]   Stubbock is growling.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.480]   --stubbock is growling.
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:55.200]   He says, I've had it with you guys.
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:56.680]   I'm out of here.
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:59.800]   We did twig every Wednesday, 130% of it,
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:03.280]   poor 30 Eastern, 20, 30 UTC.
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:08.040]   If you want to watch this mess happen live, you can.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:10.000]   Just go to twit.tv/live.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.360]   That's the live stream.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:12.640]   And actually, there's audio and video,
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.680]   so you can watch or listen.
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:16.680]   You can even do that with your Amazon Echo or other voice
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:17.440]   enabled devices.
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:24.360]   Something like Echo Play Twit Live, I think, would work.
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:26.440]   And then you would just get whatever's going on live.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.440]   You can also say Echo Play this week in Google Podcast,
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:31.120]   and you get the latest episode.
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:32.600]   And what is that, Stacey?
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:35.600]   I was going to say, then you can see the room that people
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:36.760]   are making fun of before.
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.360]   Which is gorgeous.
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:40.360]   It's a beautiful room.
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:41.240]   You're beautiful.
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.720]   I like the mix of horizontal stripes and diagonal stripes.
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:47.320]   It's a beautiful thing.
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:49.920]   I think the composition's stunning.
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:52.920]   Stunning.
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:56.680]   Well, I just got a request to change my Twitter password.
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:57.800]   Oh!
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:59.640]   I think it'll look like I'll bet you did too.
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:02.080]   You think the passwords are compromised?
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.400]   No, but this is the Twitter application.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:05.600]   It's making them change.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.480]   Oh, all right.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:09.120]   Taylor Lawrence says, we're back.
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.920]   Sorry, everyone.
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:16.240]   Tom Lawrence says, verified Twitter users can now tweet again.
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:21.040]   Yeah, I'm not getting anything on my--
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.880]   Are you on the Twitter application or you're on?
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:24.000]   Yeah, you're.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:24.840]   Yeah, that's the Twitter.
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:25.840]   That's the desktop.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.280]   Let me see if I go on the app.
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:30.440]   Tweet tweet.
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:31.240]   Oh, who cares?
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:32.120]   I don't care.
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:33.360]   I hate Twitter.
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.560]   What am I going to celebrate this for?
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:37.920]   Now, now it says something's wrong.
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:39.600]   See what's live.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.600]   No, I can't go on the wall.
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:41.960]   All right, it's time to go.
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.600]   I'm not going to tweet that.
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.800]   OK.
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:47.920]   We're just jealous.
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:49.720]   That's all there is to it, Stacey.
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:52.840]   We're just sad, lonely old men who
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:58.040]   are jealous of your youth, your brains, and your good taste.
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:38:59.200]   And your excellent taste.
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.200]   Excellent taste.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.520]   Damn straight.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:04.560]   Damn straight.
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:07.000]   Remember, one thing, Stacey, never forget,
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.720]   the eyes of Texas are upon you.
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:11.800]   We do this show-- I said all that stuff.
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:14.280]   If you don't want to be here live,
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.280]   go get the show on demand.
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:19.040]   We make it available at our website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.280]   Best thing to do is subscribe in your favorite podcast
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.320]   application.
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.160]   And then you will get a copy of it every time it's done,
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:29.520]   whether you want to or not.
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:30.480]   Thank you, everybody.
