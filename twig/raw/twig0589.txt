[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey as the week off. Matthew Ingram's in from the Columbia
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.960]   Journalism Review joining Jeff Jarvis and of course Ant Pruitt. I have in my hands 128 page
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.920]   indictment of Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission 46 state attorneys general in Guam and
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.680]   Washington DC. We will talk about that. The merits of the case will also talk about Timnet Gebru.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.480]   She's out at Google but why and what's happening to the movies? Should everything be streamed in
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.200]   2021? It's all coming up next on Twig. This week in Google comes to you from Twig's last past

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.480]   all around the universe including the Google verse, the Twitter verse. And this week probably a
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   little bit about the Facebook verse as well. Stacey's got the week off joining us from the Columbia
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.960]   Journalism Review, their chief digital writer Matthew Ingram. Hello Matthew.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.360]   Calling from the Great White North. And it's we got our first snow, Jeff Jarvis got his first
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.040]   snow of the season today in New Jersey. I mean, I asked Matthew and he said, yeah, it's been 11
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.880]   day 11 weeks. What how long is 11? It's been a lot a lot of winter in Canada.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.360]   I'll just get in the start. Yeah, just getting started. Also with this, the Leonard Taill
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.400]   professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark School, graduate school of journalism
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   at the City University of New York, once again, a 10 out of 10. According to his rate, my Skype room.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.000]   Which I won't lord over you too much that you're an eight out of 10. I get my first rating.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.760]   And it's a lousy eight. You might have overdone it a little bit this week. It's on their rundown.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.320]   It's the last thing another. It's very frustrating because what we did is we tweeted the moment last
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.000]   week when was it you talking about right by scapering. Yeah. And you're caught up that somebody else
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.920]   had Christmas decorations. Yeah. No one had done. Well, here, watch.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.680]   This is room raider. I love seeing people. I like seeing the stores that way. Yeah, I do too.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.720]   And it was been roads today. Major points. He had Christmas decorations on the bookshop behind
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.400]   this new competition. Oh, yeah. Can I check for Christmas behind me? Oh, yes, Stacy. Yes. Yes.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.640]   Oh, yo. Yes, Stacy. Have we talked about Google yet? I feel like we should have some Google stories.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.120]   Look at this. Look at this.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   There you go. Happy decorations. And I got a mere eight out of 10 for that.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.200]   It's just about it. Those of you listening. I'm so in fear. Just decked the holes. I'm so
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   infuriated. So, so, so, three seconds in order in order to get 10 out of 10. I have double decked.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.520]   I think you may have got overboard now. I think I even have a giant land. A giant point set a bow
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.360]   on my surface studio and bells on the last pass sign. And every. There's. Oh, that could be arranged.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.120]   I got one right there. I got it. Oh, man. I got it all. I get it all. Anyway, happy holidays,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.240]   everybody. Also with his aunt Pruitt, the host of Hands-On Photography Hands-On Wellness. And
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   he is also just reviewed on Hands-On Technology, a really cool e-bike called the Van Muf.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.560]   Yeah, that thing is really, really, really nice. It's really interesting. Yeah, I love e-bikes. I'm a
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.240]   big fan. How much? Yeah, that's the problem. Two grand. Yeah, that's so expensive.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.720]   Well, hold on. If you look at it compared to some of the other bikes in this thing. Oh, it's cheaper
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.800]   than this class. I know. It's like half the price. Specialized. I mean, road bikes are not cheap.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   Yeah, I have a rad power bike. They're about 1500, 1400, 1400. And I love it.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.120]   It's my e-bikes are great for old people like me. So does it work? Is it? Hold on, hold on. I got
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.840]   an old guy question. I live in the hills. So I can ride it as a real bike and then I hit a hill
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.000]   that can help me a bit. It's a pedal assist. It's more than a bit. So this is the one I would,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.200]   I don't know about the Van Muf. That's a little pricey. This is the rad power. I would get,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.520]   I have the city. I'm sorry. Well, yeah, you can get the city. I have the city. They have a variety
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.080]   of these. That's a thousand. It's not as pretty because like the van with the batteries hidden in
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.480]   the near city. That looks like an e-bank. The van is a little like the battery. I don't want to
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.800]   try to hide it. But I think the performance is excellent. This is great. This wagon,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.520]   see this thing on the back? You can put kids on there. You could put a trailer. You can,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.240]   it's a haul. You can bring stuff with you. This is the one I have. I really like the rad city.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.120]   Actually, it's a great one. So when you hit the hill, what happens?
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.080]   So, first of all, the way these are configured and it really varies by state and by bicycles.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.200]   And I think this is probably different from the Van Muf. It's definitely different from the
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:04.720]   specialized. This one has a throttle. So that's legal. The two limits in California,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.600]   I bet they're the same in New Jersey. You can't go more than 20 miles an hour.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   You have to have pedals. But in this case, in California, anyway, you can have a throttle. So,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.440]   you don't have to pedal at all. You could just ride it around like a moped. And it only goes up
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.400]   to 20 miles an hour. But it's great. If you're on a flat, you don't need to pedal. You actually
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.200]   need to pedal on a hill because it's not enough to lift you up the hill. But you put it in low gear
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.680]   and you pedal and you, yes, you don't have to stand up. You don't have to kill yourself. You'll
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   love it, Jeff. I highly recommend them. But on a flat, I can still pedal. If you want,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.320]   you could pedal all you want. You could turn the engine off and pedal. Well, no, I'm asking
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.920]   something different. I said, what I'm trying to get. Yes, you could still, I want just assistance.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.880]   There are, there are in this bike, five levels of assistance. So if you have it at one, you're
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.400]   pedaling a lot with a little bit of assist. If you have it at five, it's assisting in
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.960]   bringing up 20 miles an hour almost instantly. Right. You throttle, which doesn't look at
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.600]   Chris Mode for Tesla when it takes off. And then if you turn off what you could also do,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.120]   then you're pedaling like it's a regular bike. So even if you're a battery dog,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   yeah, it's a little heavy. It's 60 pounds. So can you get snow tires? You keep asking that.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:22.000]   I don't know. I'd like to have one. Here is a recommended for Canada. Lisa has the fat tire
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.800]   edition. This is so there's a fat tire. I don't know if that's a snow tire. No, I don't. But
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.840]   it's a fat tire. I don't know if it's a snow. You know what? You maybe you can get a snow tire.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.400]   I don't know. It's got reflective sidewalls. I don't know. The nice thing is the brake lights
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.640]   and the front light are powered off the battery, which is really great. So you've got built-in lights.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.800]   I feel very safe in these. I'm a big fan. Thank you for that little explanation.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.680]   Nothing I'm going to actually get one. You should totally get a rowing machine.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   No, get this instead of a rowing machine. You'd be so much after you get a rowing machine as well.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   Get them both. You can never have too many exercises.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.640]   But I don't use things that you don't use. I live in the country now, so I've got an ATV
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.560]   four by four. Do you really? Nice. So you're living at the cabin now. No exercise though.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   Are you living at the cabin now? No, a different role. It looks kind of rustic. It's nice.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.360]   It's nice. We're going to see Matthew on the show building off the grid.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.800]   I love that show. Oh, I do too. We go off the grid all the time.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.720]   It's my dream. We want to. I love building Alaska too. I love the show.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.680]   It's all going to change when Elon gets startling up and running and you'll be able to live anywhere
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.520]   and have good... It's fine. I've already tried to sign up. That's the one grid I want as the internet.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.720]   We have solar. We have well. We have septic. So we're practically there already. I just need
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:57.440]   internet. So I get 10 megabits. Well, it's not too bad. Is that cellular or phone?
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.840]   I'm actually using cellular right now. That's because it's faster. Yeah.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.120]   Well, so you could do this. You can't be too far off the grid.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.280]   So there are a number of stories. There's a huge Google story
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.240]   which broke. We kind of started with it. The Timnett-Gebru story. We talked a little bit about it last week.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:26.720]   She is a very well-known AI ethicist and scientist. She wrote the original paper
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.760]   that showed that women of color were often
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.360]   identified by face recognition technology. That was a couple of years ago.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:44.080]   Google hired her to be part of their ethical AI team. They fired her
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.000]   last week after she created the whole team. I think.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.920]   Oh, really? So she was her team. She had written a research paper with a
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.520]   co-author to a research paper with a number of other people that apparently Google didn't like
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.160]   too much. Among other things, the paper and actually the MIT,
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:13.120]   I'm so glad to find this. Technology wrote about it. They didn't put the paper up,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.880]   but they summarized the paper. They talked about what Google probably didn't like about it.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:26.320]   One of the things Google said, "Hey, that stuff about how much the carbon footprint of AI and training
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.760]   artificial intelligence is that old?" We've gotten better than that because
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.680]   they remember Google's really pushing the fact that there's carbon neutral and all that.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   She, in the paper, she said that energy consumption and carbon footprints of machine learning
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:53.760]   training AI models have been exploding since 2017 as models have been fed more and more data.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:03.680]   I got the impression was partly, they were partly upset about her argument that large data
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   set machine learning, which is exactly what Google does, the larger the data set,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.000]   the less you should trust it, unless you can basically disclose everything that the data set does,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.280]   which obviously they don't want to do. By the way, that's why Google hired her
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.480]   is to raise alarms about stuff like that.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.120]   Aratically, yeah.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.200]   Now, Google said we didn't fire her--
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.320]   Which she sent to me email though.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.880]   Sorry?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.720]   She sent a mean email.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.120]   She sent a mean email. Google said that they wouldn't publish the paper because,
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.920]   "It didn't meet our bar for publication." She sent an email
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:49.600]   that said she would resign unless Google met a number of conditions, which it was unwilling to
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.920]   meet. She tweeted that she had asked to negotiate a last date for her employment after she got back
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.960]   from vacation. She was cut off from her corporate email before she got back.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.280]   They were negotiating her departure, but they fired her before the negotiation, I guess.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   Yeah, they said--
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:16.800]   So Google basically said, "You were taking your note about these conditions
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.640]   to mean that if we don't meet them, you will resign.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.800]   And instead of taking time for you to resign, we think you need to resign
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.520]   effective immediately because of the email you sent."
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.240]   Now, I often try to avoid employment disputes because the law, especially in California,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.200]   is very strict about what you could talk about as an employer.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:46.080]   So we probably don't know what else went on or anything like that.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   However, a lot of people at Google, 1,200 workers have signed a petition condemning the firing.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.720]   Many other were--
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.640]   And Google itself, Her boss, talked about it. So it's kind of a thing.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.480]   Yeah, said he's going to investigate.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.320]   Yeah, Sundar Pichai, today--
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.760]   Well, below that, too.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.040]   No, the Her Direct.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.480]   Oh, Her Direct Boss.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.520]   The direct, right.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.000]   Okay.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.560]   Oh, do you?
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.480]   And today, Sundar Pichai apologized for the company's handling of Her departure and
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.200]   said he'd investigate and work to restore trust.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.760]   This was a memo he sent internally, but Axios, of course.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.040]   Obtained.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.920]   Yeah, so my problem is we don't know what else happened.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.960]   So I'm always hesitant to weigh in on these things.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.200]   My initial response was the whole policy about
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.360]   submitting this information.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.000]   And you had, was it a two-week window?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.560]   Two-week.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.000]   For approval? And I have no problem with standard operating procedures,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.440]   but according to these other staff members, that SOP really meant a hill of beans.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.400]   It never really mattered.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.120]   Yeah, I think there was a lot of things that just didn't really meet the requirements
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.920]   of two weeks and didn't really matter at times.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.880]   Yeah, Casey Newton said that he heard from people at Google that no one
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.800]   submits their papers two weeks before.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   She was treated differently than normal.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.000]   I was totally fine when I saw that there was a procedure in place and I said,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.880]   okay, well, you're supposed to follow the procedure, but if the procedure was
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.520]   bull crap, I guess where she's coming from.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.080]   So here's-
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.920]   Regardless, I mean, it looks terrible.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.200]   Yeah, that's what I would say.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.520]   Yes.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.560]   Look, that's what I would say.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   That's what I would say.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.880]   Not a good look.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.240]   Even if there were all sorts of other things we don't know about,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.480]   it's not a good look.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.080]   You hire a black woman to be your ethics to run your ethics team and then fire her
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.920]   because you don't like what her report was.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.080]   It doesn't look good.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   Yeah, it just looks terrible.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:16:00.880]   Let us make the diversity higher to look good and have the right options.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.200]   It looks like-
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:08.240]   We want to look into ethics of AI right up until it threatens our use of AI.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   This is- What is happening over the last few months and this week particularly is that the big tech
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.320]   companies are- People are kind of turning- There's-
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.400]   Tyna seems to be turning against them.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.880]   The other big story this week is that 46 states plus Guam and Washington DC have joined the Federal
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.840]   Trade Commission in suing Facebook for illegal monopolization.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.200]   And boy, when you get 46 out of 50 states coming down your throat-
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.800]   And Guam.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.760]   Don't forget-
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.720]   Gay, Feel Free Commission Authorized a Completion-
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.320]   Oh, I'm sorry. This auto play.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.680]   You know, Ian, you got to learn about auto play on the website.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.160]   The MfGwam punches above their weight.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.360]   Yeah, clearly.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.160]   I've been reading.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:01.280]   I downloaded the 124 page filing and it's very thoughtful, very well written.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.360]   Obviously, in the research for this, they had a lot of emails.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.080]   In fact, they had a lot of internal information because some of it's redacted
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.840]   in the public release.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.560]   It is a very, I think, somewhat damning history of Facebook's-
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.240]   You know, exactly as they have been accused by others-
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.840]   Any competitive acquisition of Instagram and then later WhatsApp.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.000]   There's smoking guns galore.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.480]   I mean, there's emails from Mark Zuckerberg saying, "Yeah, we want to get them
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.960]   before they get too big and threaten us."
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.480]   And he even said it by-
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.760]   And this is exactly what A trust law is supposed to prevent.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.960]   By buying this company, not only we take a competitor out,
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.320]   but we gain enough scale and we gain enough technology that no one else can
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.160]   compete with us down the road.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.520]   That's exactly-
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.240]   That's like you wrote your own indictment.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.080]   The only thing-
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   Sorry.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.440]   Go ahead.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.320]   Go ahead.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.280]   I was just going to say that-
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.640]   All the smoking guns and what Facebook said about Instagram and WhatsApp,
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.600]   first they have to prove that Facebook is a monopoly.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:20.640]   So it's not illegal to buy companies or even if they're-
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.680]   Well, they address that.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.960]   In fact, they address that even before they talk about the smoking gun,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.720]   to say that what the space Facebook is in is essentially without competition.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.880]   But I don't see how-
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.800]   Like, that's an arguable point.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.320]   Is TikTok not competition?
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.960]   Are they ruling it?
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.800]   Is TikTok the competition?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.560]   We had the actors for last week that showed everything.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.040]   Every site now has the same features.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.240]   As far as I can understand, they're arguing that Facebook,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.680]   its market consists solely of talking to your friends.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.920]   So then TikTok doesn't apply because it's not you talking to your friends.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.120]   They call it a personal social networking service.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.720]   And they do in fact specifically say why it's not the same as Twitter.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.840]   It's not the same as messenger applications of any kind.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.680]   Facebook's lawyer as well have a few things to say about that.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.880]   This is what Benedict Evans talks about all the time about Facebook,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.400]   about Amazon and so on, is it's all about definition of market.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.840]   Matthew is exactly right.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.720]   You have to start with what the market is before you can say you're a monopolist in it,
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.280]   before you can then say that you abuse your monopoly.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.360]   It's not just that though.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.960]   If you look at Instagram, I mean, I remember when they bought Instagram.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:38.160]   And Instagram was fun, but had no revenues of any kind.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.120]   And I don't know, did it have a million users even?
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.760]   No, probably not.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   And so growing very fast.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.720]   I wasn't saying it was growing.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.600]   Yeah, but it's a little bit.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.480]   Look at it.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.840]   Like even if you'd looked at it, you would have thought this is ridiculous.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.400]   It's a tiny little photo sharing thing.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:58.480]   Like now it looks because they've connected it to Facebook.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.880]   But at the time, I think it would have been difficult to make the case that it would be
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.680]   anti-competitive.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.040]   I agree about you.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.840]   So I'll give you a couple of quotes.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.400]   Early on in the in the cleaning, there is a long section
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.120]   talking about why they consider Facebook to be unique in personal social networking.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.200]   And that there is no competition.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.840]   And they say they have something like 70% of the market.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.360]   Personal social networking services, they rather distinct from a not reasonably interchangeable with
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.680]   specialized social networking services like those that focus on professional,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.880]   LinkedIn, or interest-based Strava connections.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.680]   Specialized networks are designed for and used primarily for sharing a narrow and highly
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   specialized category of content.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   They're distinct from a not reasonably interchangeable with online video or audio consumption
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.120]   focused services like YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and Hulu.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.360]   They probably wrote this before TikTok was a big player.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.760]   They say mobile messaging services do not feature a shared social space in which users can interact.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   I mean, they clearly know that they have to prove this and they spend a lot of time.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.200]   Yeah, Facebook's lawyers are going to have that's what it's going to happen.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.240]   That's what it's going to happen.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.360]   They quote Mark Zuckerberg from his 2019 post calling personal social networking providers
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.480]   like Facebook, the digital equivalent of a town square contrasted with the private
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.920]   communication offering by services like WhatsApp, which are the digital equivalent of the living room.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.800]   So even Zuckerberg makes that distinction.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:41.280]   Yeah, I'm sure the Facebook's defense is, oh no, we're just, we're part of a much larger
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   internet ecosystem.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   But I think you can really make the argument that Facebook has moved at every point to
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.280]   consolidate, because of the network effect, which they address, because of Facebook's gathering of
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:01.440]   data, which they describe, they say Facebook has a substantial competitive advantage with
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.720]   respected data because of its ability to align Facebook user identity across the family of apps
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.360]   that is acquired, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others, and with users off Facebook data, the like button.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.800]   The volume, velocity, and variety of Facebook's user data, give it an unprecedented virtually
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.480]   360 degree view of the user and her contacts, interests, preferences, and activities,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.920]   which allows Facebook to personalize content to its users that other platforms are not able to
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.400]   provide.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:39.440]   They also say that they have a significant advantage in the ability to monopolize the service,
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.960]   because of networking barriers in personal social networking services market,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.520]   make putative competitors unlikely to be able to match Facebook's access to users' time,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.720]   and attention, which in turn determines the volume of inventory for ads they can sell to advertisers.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:04.000]   So what seems to me one question they're going to have to answer is, why then did these acquisitions
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.920]   go ahead?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   Why did the SEC and antitrust not say something at the time?
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.000]   Because now it's late.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.120]   You're going back years to reverse an acquisition.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.440]   Like the message that sends to companies that are going to acquire things is at any point in the
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.760]   future. If you build that thing up to be something great, we can force you to sell it.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.040]   Here's another smoking gun. There was a company, I didn't remember this,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:36.880]   called OctaZen. OctaZen was a connector that would take contact information, format it,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.160]   and then allow you to suck it up. In July 2009, Head of International Growth, Javier Alavan
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.640]   learned that Twitter was also licensing OctaZen's services. He emailed to other executives to suggest
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.160]   that as valuable as licensing was proving to be owning them would be even better.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.560]   Complete control of OctaZen would enable Facebook to deprive rivals and potential rivals of this
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.160]   important resource. Would it make sense to try to buy these guys by doing so? We would keep in
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.880]   house the expertise of building and maintaining improved importers and let everyone else in the
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.160]   industry without a provider for contact importer libraries. They bought the company.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.160]   Just like Twitter bought TweetTech right off from underneath the hands of a friend of mine.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:32.000]   Who had a deal too? I put up the right below the stories on line 40 something. I put up that
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.920]   Axios chart again which is worth looking at. It shows how line 40 you do.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:48.320]   It shows how by feature it's not a monopoly. Everybody is doing it, their rails is doing.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:55.040]   Yeah, nobody would say that the experience of Facebook is anything like the experience on any
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:03.600]   of these other ones. Well, it depends on how you use it. If you love stories on Facebook,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:11.760]   it's like Snapchat and it's like everybody. There are people that use Pinterest quite heavily
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.360]   and it's like another message in and communication platform even though. Do you go to Pinterest
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:24.400]   so to see what the grandkids are up to or to? Some people do? Pardon? Some people do.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:33.520]   I think it's a stronger part of the case is their arguments about the API. It's not as
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.200]   sexy as the acquisition part but I think they have a lot more ammunition to
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.800]   to say force Facebook to allow more access to APIs or to be more transparent about the APIs
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.640]   and quit cutting off smaller competitors. I wish and what is that Twitter?
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   Other networks out there. What does that put Twitter? What does that say?
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.080]   Is there was a lot of fuss and kerfofil over to Twitter API many years ago regarding things
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.000]   like Tweet Deck? They have been opening up more so they I think they realized at some point that
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that was a mistake. They nuked the entire developer community and it took years to sort of,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.600]   I mean they're still developing. They're still under water.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:26.720]   Well what helps not kill this complaint but it has a big impact on it. At the exact same time
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.800]   it comes out is the story online 77.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:44.720]   You there? So yeah TikTok is a Facebook to become the top app worldwide by downloads
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:51.200]   but it's not even close in monthly or daily active users. No but the point is this is early days
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:58.640]   and friend feed is going to own everything. Well but that's the point is Facebook in the
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.880]   put friend feed out of business put friends they're out of business puts put my space out of business
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.320]   there's a whole section on what happened to Google+.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:13.200]   If they play me in Facebook for Google+, I mean Google put Google+ out of business.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.840]   Yeah they're also saying that Google+ couldn't be with Facebook and Facebook was very worried
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.120]   about Google+. And that was an example of something they couldn't acquire.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.400]   Well they have again they have a lot of emails you know.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.520]   They're calling Mike Olguden.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.840]   A lot. Where they maybe maybe not I don't know they have a lot of emails.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:38.640]   I mean there's no question there's no question Facebook is a massive massive company and it's got
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.560]   a huge amount of power especially the algorithm and it's ad business. The problem is going to be
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.120]   proving that that is illegal or that they've done something.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.880]   That's why this is going to go for years.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.680]   Yes.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Yes. But on the other hand what I am encouraged by this is this doesn't look like a political
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:09.040]   hatchet job by any means. This isn't because Facebook decided to fact check the president's posts
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.240]   or anything like that.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   No you're not. How do you tell these days?
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.480]   You're a spical ahead.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.680]   Well there's a little you know there is a actually a little bit of that
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.160]   in the complaint but this is 46 states this is not just the red states.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   This is a lot of people.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.440]   I think if I were Facebook take it pretty seriously what's interesting is the stock market doesn't
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.040]   seem to be too worried about it.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.640]   Facebook I think was down 2 percent let me just see where it is.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.480]   It's not like market knows it's a year.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.040]   Yeah the Nasdaq was down and the Nasdaq was down considerably. The Nasdaq was down 2 percent.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.320]   So Facebook just matched the Nasdaq. Yeah nothing is going to have to throw the Nasdaq.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.760]   It was down 1.93 percent today.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.240]   So 1.94 for the Nasdaq.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.200]   So it's exactly.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.920]   They're too big a chunk of the Nasdaq clearly.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.200]   Yeah you know this is we're going to be covering this one for a long time.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:09.360]   I have to say it's very well written. There's a lot of establishing emails and quotes.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.120]   It's not a lot of supposition in here. Well watch this was interesting.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.120]   It's um yeah and you know you get this is when you get 46 states and they fed
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.360]   breathing down your neck.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.760]   Well this is the issue now. It's like the Australian law which I'm sure we'll talk about
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.160]   in a few minutes. It's like the French law before.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:36.400]   It's now the suddenly in media and politics at least not among users
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   the unpopular industry.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.200]   So you can go after them right. They're treating them like cigarettes now which is
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.720]   ridiculous because it's an industry that gives us wonderful things. It doesn't kill us.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.920]   But it's their treatment like oil and cigarettes and we can go get taxes out of them.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:57.440]   New York is there's only a proposal in a state legislator to tax every delivery you get from
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.000]   online for three dollars a box. You know because because it's easy to go after them now.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.440]   It's the unpopularity tax.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.560]   The argument about um uh Benedict Evans made about the Australian is has nothing to do
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.440]   with copyright. Nothing to do with freedom expression.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.000]   It's all about politicians going after an allegedly unpopular industry.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.960]   I would say this uh this uh indictment of Facebook is nothing like the Australian
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.600]   indictment which is clearly driven by a few special interests lobbying the government to act
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.200]   on their behalf. I don't know if this this is such a broad there's a political you are you trying
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.680]   to say there's not a political angle at all to this?
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.440]   Um I think this is a reasonable
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:52.240]   question. I don't think it's political. No. I think this clearly Facebook has acted
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.880]   in a predatory fashion. I mean you might be able to defend it. I think it's going to be a stretch
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:04.560]   to say Facebook has competition uh but that that will be one angle of defense but it's pretty
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.000]   clearly they acted in a very predator. Microsoft like predatory fashion buying and killing competitors
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.280]   um so that they could become they could have this dominant position. That's pretty clear.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.960]   That's not political that's clear.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:24.400]   So one big thing that we haven't mentioned is that antitrust law for the last several decades
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.720]   has focused on consumer harm as the most important thing. Not anti-competitive behavior
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.520]   not how other companies are affected how consumers-
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.440]   They make a case for consumer harm in here.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.480]   I know. That's going to be the hard part. That's going to be the hard part. You're going to have to
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.880]   because of course you don't pay for it so you can't say the price is too high but you'll they
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.320]   will have to argue that consumers are harmed because of vague things like privacy or their data
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.440]   being shared. Those are difficult because they're doing voluntarily right for for a reason to get
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.680]   a free service. Yeah. Yeah okay I think they make a pretty strong case for not only a consumer
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.560]   harm but also advertiser harm. Um but nobody cares about that. Yeah okay but that's enough fronts that
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.680]   and I think antitrust law in the United States is evolving. I don't I think that that was another
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.320]   thing that's happening. It's not necessarily. It is. Yeah. Yeah. It's not just consumer harm or
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.120]   company harm they're looking at but you have to shift the entire sort of body of antitrust law.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.480]   The hardest thing is to know what remedies they would be looking for or would be reasonable
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   and the when politics does get into it because I want I mean I guess the courts are going to
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.000]   decide this but nevertheless I think there might be some Facebook users might be right at various
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   states attorneys general for going after their beloved Facebook. It's a lot of the
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.920]   simplicity of the best what if they divest Instagram and what's up and then they start an Instagram
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.960]   competitor and they start a WhatsApp competitor. Yeah that's how do we benefit how does that make
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   things any better. I wish they hadn't put a path out of business because that was a good
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.400]   competitor. Um but that you know that was just a better UI. It was better in every respect.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   Matthew's Matthew I don't want to say Matthew's analysis on this has been trenchant and
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.280]   and right and every level of it I think I think will come back to his analysis and
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.840]   um it's well thought trenchant is good right thanks trenchant I don't know it is good but it
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:32.000]   always reminds me of trench trench foot so I don't I feel like or trench mouth or trench mouth so
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.160]   it's good but it has a bad kind of vibe to it. It is vigorous or incisive in expression or style
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:46.320]   and in an archaic sense having a sharp edge yes. It's the peak one the peak one peak one sea of
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:53.280]   speech or something. Bigorous and incisive I think is the no thanks operative sense here so
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.400]   yeah put that put that on your twitter bio and as when it comes to consumer harm I just blurb you
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.720]   when it comes to consumer harm one of the things they are uh they're very much talking about is
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.400]   how Facebook has been used to bring Nazism into people's homes and things like that I mean there's
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.040]   it's a really interesting oh and and the GOP has has had nothing to do with that
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.720]   well doesn't GOP trying to kill the American man or it did nothing to do with that that's
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.480]   not a good thing but it's a separate thing uh no totalitarianism came from a simple social
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:30.320]   network not from the White House not at all. Remember this this is I don't even know if this is at
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.040]   this point I don't think the White House is pursuing this or pushing this uh what is the White House
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.520]   this is Jay Rosen's point off it is is there will be this is a
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.400]   there'll be something that's new what happens with the Biden administration like do they push this
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.600]   I think this continues but uh I think it does I think there there's also against because because
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.000]   they have old farts there from old industries like media who are against uh technology companies
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.240]   and that's the problem and so people I know who've been trying to advise the Biden team
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.760]   have been trying to bring in different voices into this but the problem now is those voices are
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.200]   the a-holes we don't like for Silicon Valley so that's the problem here's uh among here's one of the
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.840]   paragraphs users of personal social networking services have suffered and continue to suffer a
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.520]   variety of harms is a consequence of Facebook's illegal contact conduct including degraded quality
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.000]   of users experience less choice and personal social networks suppressed innovation reduced
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.520]   investment in potentially competing services Facebook's conduct deprives users of product
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.160]   improvements and as a result users have suffered and continued to suffer reductions in the quality
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.720]   and variety of privacy options and content available to them by eliminating suppressing and
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.080]   deterring the emergence of growth of personal social networking rivals Facebook also harms
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.720]   advertisers in a number way including less transparency to assess the value they receive
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.320]   from advertisements and harm to their brand during- Meanwhile they're going to complain they're
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.800]   going to complain that Google is a monopoly in advertising and you can't you know have it both
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.240]   ways here folks well they know Google's a monopoly in advertising over Facebook is doing huge things
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.560]   in advertising they quote Cheryl Sandberg saying this is not search advertising this is social
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.760]   advertising they are specifically saying this is a different kind of advertising that what Google
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.880]   does and they have a monopoly in social advertising well that's that's market but that's that's that's
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.400]   that's PR in the same way as what I'm around Google Matthew and I around Google people
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.720]   they if we if anybody says the platforms the Google people are all trained like automatons
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:33.600]   to say we are not all platforms don't put us with them it's PR and it'll be useful in their
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.440]   argument but it's it's PR they're competing with each other for advertising period so if
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:46.560]   Facebook had not purchased the Instagram and decided to just build their own version of this
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.840]   would any of this be a problem and they continue to have as many users on that platform
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.240]   yeah but the the issue is that they clearly showed in their emails that they purchased
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.720]   Instagram for any competitive reasons so it's just it's okay at the time well it was fine at the time
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.040]   okay it was a tiny service they overpaid for it yeah we're not gonna
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.720]   collapse in AT&T I mean it was a tiny photo sharing thing it wasn't that tiny I mean they're
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.880]   talking in this again I'm pulling you back to the court document they say how fast Instagram was
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.240]   going instantly and I'm concerned and again they have the emails people inside Facebook were
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.800]   at how fast Instagram was going in particularly because Instagram was mobile first and photos first
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.840]   and Facebook could not compete with that I think they're I think I don't know I am I think this is
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:49.040]   a very compelling document is it well constructed case is it just a judge that you have to convince
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:56.320]   or is it would there be there ultimately may be a jury right I doubt this is going to be a jury
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.120]   trial you think it'll be judge only I don't even think it's going to go to a trial oh they'll so
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.200]   so dr trenchet you think it's going to be settled or never get there or what's going to happen well
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.320]   I'm sure Facebook would love to settle this either never get there or so hard to settle with 46
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:16.160]   states in the FTC not to mention Guam not impossible those those wamers are really hard
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.200]   negotiate with yeah to their face books largest acquisitions the mobile social photo app instagram
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.000]   and the mobile messaging service WhatsApp each posed a unique and dire threat to Facebook's
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.640]   monopoly each had enormous and rapidly growing user networks in each was well positioned
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.720]   to encroach on Facebook's dominant market position Facebook well that's ridiculous
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   Instagram it is ridiculous to say Instagram at the time posed a dire threat to Facebook
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:49.360]   I just think that's absurd well they have to make the case obviously and I think they they
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:56.400]   believe they've made the case because they have a lot of documentary support for that and including
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.320]   the opinion of people inside Instagram inside Facebook were very I think you could actually
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.640]   make a better argument for WhatsApp I mean for instance at the paid 19 billion well but
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.520]   was face at the time Facebook anybody else at the time faced well same thing happened with Instagram
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.600]   Instagram was valued at half a billion and there's an email from Mark Zuckerberg saying we should
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.800]   pay a billion so they can't say no but what's app someone offered to pay a hundred million
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   and they paid 19 billion right and it was also what's happening the uh
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:31.280]   just message oh yeah what's in here so I think they've got a better case with WhatsApp than they
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:37.360]   do with Instagram yeah I think you're right what would a judge order what would a judge say
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:43.520]   would have to how you put an ombudsman in there no sense like you open the API yeah I don't think
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.760]   breaking up at this point yeah so what what the what the UK is doing the UK is starting a new
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.520]   competitive regulator because they love regulators there and it's going to be less focused on
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.960]   breaking up so that kind of stuff because they can't really do it from the UK but it's going to be
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:02.320]   setting standards and accountability and and and that kind of stuff so it's going to it's going to
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:09.440]   be watching them like a hawk on certain criteria and I think if they're we could all benefit if
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:16.400]   they actually pushed transparency and openness and and federating with other apps I mean we'd be
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:23.440]   way better off than just some order that they sell these two things whatever happened to @jax
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.360]   I forget the name of the project where he was going to basically go on Twitter open source it's
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.720]   still going what's the name of that do you remember I forget I think because that could be a really
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:41.280]   interesting piece here right where where fun Jack says Jack meanwhile the great party spoiler
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   says I'm gonna federate Twitter and I'm gonna build a value added business on top of it just
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:53.120]   like WordPress Twitter does not in any way compete with Facebook Twitter's not even close to Facebook
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:59.360]   that's true I disagree oh I come what you guys are nuts first of all nobody uses Twitter except
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.280]   you guys nobody uses Twitter except you know the media you know other people do most people
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.720]   you know you don't use Facebook anymore well I don't yeah for this reason I don't want to participate
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:17.520]   but they're very most daughters do not use Twitter and they don't use Facebook either probably
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.280]   Twitter Twitter is completely separate it's it's about short hot takes Facebook is about seeing
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:29.840]   what your family and friends are up to reading reading the news joining groups it's a very different
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.640]   experience it's no cop it's not it's not comparable at all I would argue that a Facebook group is not
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.120]   that different from Twitter but at least some of the Facebook groups I've been in there's a lot
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:45.840]   of short hot takes in there and a lot of it is trolling it's not that different the the premise is
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   the whole family and friends connection on Facebook but you can with a little bit of know-how
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.560]   curate the same type of nobody's doing that aunt I got bad news for you yeah doesn't I know
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.880]   the normals are not you nobody's doing that oh yeah I've got all my aunts and uncles on Twitter and
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.400]   we just talk together amongst each other Twitter's not that it's a very public space Facebook
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:19.600]   well I'm going to call upon the book by Andre Brock jr again that talks about black Twitter
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.880]   in a way that that black Twitter is different is a closed space yeah but it's it is but it is a
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:32.320]   space of language that's built in the public but in a sense hidden in the public in that way so
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.840]   so you know there's weird Twitter you got to be careful about how you analyze these things
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:42.800]   weird assumptions book title just so I give the the plug because it's very good on re Brock
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.880]   jr. distributed blackness African-American cyber cultures so I think you're you're right Leo but
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:57.200]   the point is that this this thank you mr. Trenchant to this holy Jesus oh the Canadian you can
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.320]   know this is a story next thing you're gonna apologize for the story of Trenchant and Trench
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:09.760]   mouse it's together hey hey hey you're right in a very limited way oh you're trying to make it up
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.640]   now Matthew the hard hard part is that all of these things overlap you can't draw a discreet
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:24.160]   boundary around Facebook's mark I agree no I agree but honestly how many users does Twitter have
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.840]   300 million four hundred and a half campaign how many users does Facebook have two and a half
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.880]   little million it's a little more than that it's a but most of them don't really use it right come on
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.800]   Twitter I would agree at least half of those 400 billion 400 million are bots
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.280]   Twitter is not Twitter is importance has been way overstated wouldn't that be an interesting
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.000]   anti-trust defense oh actually three quarters where audience doesn't exist
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.400]   Facebook really tries hard to make sure everybody on Facebook's real right that's that was there
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.240]   no one of the things they did that was your secret sauce you don't think they try to do that
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   no I don't they don't care no they don't care and fundamentally so what matters is engagement
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:16.400]   and as my favorite quote says Facebook a former Facebook engineer you know what's really engaging
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:23.360]   bullshit yeah but now I would disagree with you Matthew clearly they care about engagement
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.840]   but there's no point if a bot is engaged no one freaking cares what they care about is a human
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.800]   being that they can gather data points about while they are engaged so they can sell to them
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:40.960]   that is their absolute business model you can't sell to a bot bot's not buying you can well this
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.360]   is if a spot if a bot is well constructed it's it'll buy stuff it's fundamentally indistinguishable
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.320]   from a person yeah so you still get to charge the advertiser for the ball but right that's not
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.000]   a problem right now bot clicked on your ad scrolled down clicked on an image
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.280]   yeah but advertisers I mean okay maybe our advertisers are smarter than the average bear
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.120]   but they're really much more yes they are more interested in return on investment than
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.240]   somebody's scroll clicked and scrolled they want to see how many units they sold if the bots are
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.040]   buying okay I'll grant you that but if the bots are clicking without buying all that does look bad
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.440]   for Facebook then the advertisers come back and say oh we got all these clicks but we didn't
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.680]   get any sales that's not good I don't think that's the business they're in sure the business
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:34.960]   we're in because I hear that a lot of advertisers we sent uh I can't remember what it was 14 000
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.240]   visitors to one advertiser's website and and they were unhappy in fact they canceled because they
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   didn't sell enough product it's like well my position is if I sent them to your site you didn't
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   buy the product that's your fault i got i got them there i got them there what do you want me to do
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.640]   right you know take their wallets and take the money out you you gotta sell them once they get
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.840]   there anyway yeah you drive our advertisers are smarter again they care more about sales than they
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.120]   do about clicks and scrolls all right let's take a little break uh this is a good conversation and
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.680]   the good news is we're going to be talking about this for at least 10 more years so
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:20.160]   oh god you you are i'm not yeah oh you're leaving already that's it i'm done man i'm done i'm done
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:29.680]   with this well you know what i have uh PTSD from 1998 we had just started tech tv and the very first
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.160]   story was the DOJ goes after Microsoft the network was over before the lawsuit was over

[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.480]   really loose ant if you do that yeah that thing in front of you maybe you look like it was a there
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:36.160]   was a red rabbit trapped i'm the one with a point of a little bit in my hair oh we lost ant he's gone
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.480]   ants he met him and he said i'm not he took god i'm not talking about it anymore all right let's
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:48.400]   talk about australia because uh there is a change there you go that's a look isn't there is a change
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.240]   in the law remember the law was they were trying to it's legislation it's not a law yet
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:02.880]   let yes it hasn't passed yet the proposed law was going to uh charge google and facebook for the
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:09.360]   snippets from news organizations this you said that jeff was really uh rupert goldberg what's his
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:16.720]   name rupert murdock's uh pure pure murdock um well did murdock give up i think i think that
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.840]   happened didn't he kind of oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:25.280]   what's happened here is that is that google has been screaming that we're not we're supposed to
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.400]   negotiate we're not even allowed to bring up the fact that we bring value uh to the publishers by
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.080]   sending them value in the former people which is clearly true that's a small concession it's
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.240]   absolutely true and it's greater value before we're no here murdock's gonna end up paying google
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.520]   but that aside facebook on the other hand is it thinks that google's being uh quizzling here
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.480]   and is saying that uh if this thing passes in any form there's no news on facebook so
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.960]   google and facebook are operating at at different levels on this so uh and and apparently
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:04.240]   australian legislatures legislate tours are uh bending a little bit yes well you know it's interesting
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.200]   google used to be the one that threatened to pull out of countries you know if we had
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.840]   now it's facebook yeah now it's hand i can't well they both they both i've heard them i've heard them
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.880]   you know like threatened the plot of europe so they're they've both been like that that's just
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.320]   they just do it a different times in different ways should we know they're writing checks

[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:17.280]   tick-tock by the way this is a tick-tock trend um you whip up some instant coffee sugar lots of it
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:24.080]   and water and that while she's going to show us how because uh this is clearly the dalgana
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:30.640]   coffee queen this is not a tick-tock it's taken forever um two tablespoons granulated sugar two
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   tablespoons instant coffee two tablespoons cold water you use a hand mixer you whisk vigorously
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:43.200]   actually it's probably easier with a cupola you know one of those handheld mixers and you get it
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.800]   really froth up but apparently it tastes kind of like caramel and then it great yeah it looks kind
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.280]   of good and then you put it on there's some ice there's some milk so it's ice coffee it's ice coffee
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   basically and you put this wow look at that look at that it's a it's a christmas miracle then you
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.240]   put some sprinkles on it no you just mmm okay now i want to make it now i want to make it yeah
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:13.360]   i'll pass uh it's a diabetics dream right there and mr ant has higher taste than that
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   just just slightly though just slightly then sourdough bread we're all over sourdough right
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:25.440]   like everybody by now has stopped making sourdough pizza which is a lamakun what's that oh you want
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   to know all don't you lam lamakun well i know what pizza is i know oh july it's a turkish recipe
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:41.520]   oh nice lamahun comes from the arabic oh turkish pizza off my bahitin dough with meat
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:48.800]   think of it as a christen crispier pizza or flatbread topped with a spiced minced meat
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.520]   meat score says you know pizza is actually Greek right in you know this is Greek yeah
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:00.000]   what comes from Naples Naples was originally Greek there's um yip yip there's actually ancient
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.640]   Greek you know paintings or mosaics or something and they're basically eating pizza in them so
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.440]   i learned that on the um documentary i thought i was talking about a couple of weeks ago where
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:18.720]   they mentioned ketchup or pepé there's another one that's right Naples and Nepali or whatever
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:25.600]   what's a beer republican it's bread with beer i think every culture has a couple of things a
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:32.160]   dumpling or raviolis or something and a flatbread i think every culture has a flatbread
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:38.960]   also every culture almost every culture has meat on a stick of some kind and and fried
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.800]   we know we have corn dogs so you're right we do we need to do we need to do
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.040]   we need to do i wanted to open a restaurant chain that was just going to be called stuffed meat
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:59.520]   things i love that right parogis dumplings gyoza yeah i'd uh i'd be very happy yeah let me know when
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:07.840]   you need a sampler yeah somebody to come taste to be your meat pockets so uh you were
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:15.280]   in vain against the uh election ad ban on google and facebook because and you made an excellent
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   point that this disadvantaged up and coming in young uh poorly financed candidates not the big boys
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:30.080]   because they could buy tv ad time and it pushed more money from big money to big tv right well google
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:36.960]   has decided to lift the ban as of tomorrow just in time uh there is still a pulleyhood or not it
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.360]   seemed like this was the endless campaign season it's still going on of course there's two senate
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.880]   seats up for grabs in georgia and the fate of the nation
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:52.480]   so uh where the other so that that i guess that's who would be buying these ads who else that's why
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:59:00.480]   yeah yeah um and it's and it's a good point because the you know uh however well-funded you are and
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.360]   i think all the candidates in those two races are pretty well funded at this point uh still that's
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:09.840]   one way to reach people is with google and i honestly think facebook should be next one moment when i
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.360]   with my trenchant analysis convinced you because you were on the opposite side of first when you
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:19.840]   came yeah i you did convince me you know what i have to say for all of the ink that was spilled
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:28.720]   uh over the uh the election and all the things that could go wrong and rush in interference and
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:34.080]   all the things that you know we were worried about it actually went really surprisingly well
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.960]   that part went fine it's the stuff after the election it's going yeah everybody trying to take a
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.000]   the perfect election and throw it out that's what the problem is is that ironic now there are those
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.280]   who say oh it's you liberals now you think it's a perfect election because you won
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:53.600]   i guess i guess you could say that but there's doesn't seem to be any evidence as hard as we're
[00:59:53.600 --> 01:00:00.480]   looking uh of fraud and in fact i think that one of the things that happened was the lessons learned
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.600]   from 2016 and also most most importantly all the election the technologists who said voting
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.520]   machines without a paper trail are too dangerous you gotta have a paper trail and i think many of
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.840]   the states took that to heart and there and there was a paper trail and that's these audits that
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:23.200]   we're seeing in the recounts those are based on the paper trail and i think that that is showing
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.960]   that that's really the case that's how you avoid fraud so when i had to say whenever it was screaming
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.600]   about voting machines i was saying oh you know how come on it's fine and they were right they were
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.240]   absolutely right without a paper trail it's with that they're fine you don't leave that lady
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   the lady who was testifying for it usually i think you know the woman you uh regret starting a
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:53.040]   conversation with that a hearing yes exactly was that the said any night life take on it sounds
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.160]   like it was yeah yeah it was excellent i was racking the line unfortunately it just went on as long as
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:09.040]   um she did uh yeah that's one problem with snl isn't it they don't know how to end a skit one of
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.840]   one of several so uh you wrote an article Matthew uh in cjr the clumb of your journalism review
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:23.280]   of what you've written many but this one is on facebook's first hearings uh on this you call it
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:29.360]   the supreme court there's a couple of problems there's a couple yes there's the oversight
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:35.920]   where there's a couple of problems one is i didn't realize this it's going to take 90 days to for
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:46.160]   any uh opinion to take effect at least yeah so it doesn't really solve any immediate problems i
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:53.520]   guess is what i would say i think you put your finger on one of the big problems yeah um it we
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.240]   talked about the board uh jeff i think you agree it was a it was a prestigious group of people
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.360]   yep uh well chose chosen people including the former prime minister denmark
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.360]   um so here are the cases which you enumerate
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.800]   you know we should do a little game we could have a panel we could have judges and you could uh you
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.960]   could be the oversight board this one facebook did rolling up to the oversight board they would
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.080]   bring in 40 people in a room and show them cases and say what would you do because there are something
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:31.360]   like 20 000 appeals and they only can review six twenty thousand and that was in a number of weeks
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:39.200]   yeah yeah so obviously this is going to be a little bit of a bottleneck a screenshot of tweets
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.960]   by former malaysian prime minister in which he wrote muslims have a right to be angry and kill
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.320]   millions of french people for the massacres of the past oh was this left upper taken down
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.600]   this was left up i believe no it was taken down it was taken down so that so the only thing the
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.240]   oversight board is allowed to do is look at cases where things were taken down oh you can't look at
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.320]   things they shouldn't have been oh it's not allowed to look at things that are left up but they're
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.120]   going to figure it out how to do that okay so they're gonna because if you think about it Leo
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:17.680]   if something's left up there there's an aggrieved party which was the poster and my post was taken
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.240]   down so that's the appellant ah if somebody's left up there's nobody agree party right it could be just
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.600]   Leo doesn't like the post right yeah so it's more complicated here's one i wouldn't like photos of
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.120]   a dead child with text and bermi saying why is there no retaliation against china for its treatment
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.880]   of weir Muslims it's the image i presume not the not the content that was caused it to be taken down
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.520]   i think i'm sure there's gonna be a lot of discussion about nextworthiness with that next one is better
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:55.200]   alleged historical photos of churches in baku iser by john with uh text saying that baku had been
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.160]   built by Armenians and asking where the churches had gone this is uh the uh Armenian massacre i
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.640]   presume is the topic of the topic of this one and the Turks have been pretty to even to this day
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.840]   they really pretty much don't want to talk about it do they no um so what so this was taken down
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.280]   why they're historical photos of churches why would you take that down spain to me yeah
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:28.640]   um eight photographs on instagram which include female breasts and nipples with text and Portuguese
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.160]   about breast cancer symptoms so it was a public health message
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.280]   so this is a classic book about a boo with facebook always but they don't like nipples
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:44.480]   they like male bell yeah so that's and so they like certain nipples in certain in certain
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.360]   some nipples ways for certain reasons you now have to have a child attached to the nipple or you
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.800]   have to have literally a mastectomy or be a sculpture i think are those those are the three
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:00.720]   exceptions that have been allowed but this is a great example of how like it's it's like saying
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:08.000]   i know you know what pornography is when i see it there is no way to divine to find a policy
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.440]   that is not going to make mistakes and take things down when someone is writing about
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.720]   breast cancer and posting a photo yep it's just so i mean i go on you can see also known
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.800]   slippery slope first of all i would say in most cases these
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.360]   i mean they're all legitimate
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:37.680]   points of debate all the churches the user stated that they are against azure bajani aggression
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.360]   and vandalism so it violated the hate speech policy okay yeah i mean i think these are reasonable
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.560]   but they but there's only six of them this seems like just a drop in the bucket less even and
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.800]   they're they're so kind of obscure yeah not not to all the hate in america they're fairly obscure
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.880]   the breast one i think you know that's been an issue for a long time in facebook maybe that
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:08.640]   should be resolved once and for yeah um but i don't think it ever can be that's my point is that that
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.680]   you can i'm sure they will talk about this and and say many smart things about it and then
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.040]   we'll just go on with our lives because there's no way to come up with
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:25.600]   a coherent certainly not a policy that ai can implement i don't think uh it's this is a challenge
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.680]   uh i think you know if you don't like facebook you could argue this is exactly what they were
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.840]   hoping it would be attracting a bunch of attention doing nothing important right just taking some
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.600]   of the heat off of you know like go ahead go off and do that and let us go on with our lives so that
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.720]   was one of the sort of arguments when when they were putting it together was find a lot of smart
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.160]   people who are well meaning and let them sit in a room and talk about stuff that has nothing to do
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.760]   with anything and then we can point to it and say look see we're doing things yeah i'm working
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.960]   now i've written about this where i'm worried that and i've talked to people inside facebook
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:11.520]   that uh my my argument of facebook is that is that they don't have a north star uh when asked uh
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.200]   one of the sessions on the on the oversight board the head of the oversight board so i i asked them i
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.120]   said what are you what are you appealing to besides the statutes which are community stat
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.640]   standards of facebook he said well human rights standards well between those two there's a huge
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:31.360]   gulf that somehow needs to be filled with something and facebook hasn't really said this is why we
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.720]   exist this is what matters to facebook this is what we expect to be expected that's a good point
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.440]   respect to us yeah there's none of that that's going to inform this process so what i said
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.200]   to the people of facebook and i again i've written this out loud was you know i think that
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.280]   i was expecting an american style constitution which is all written down and here it is you know
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.440]   like a white versus a common law constitution and matthew's land and the united kingdom and such
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.360]   where it's built over time by precedent i think there's a possibility here that a constitution for
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:11.120]   facebook could be built by the outro side board if they pick cases that illuminate principles
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:18.000]   rather than statutes these six cases i don't think do that but it's so it's a it's a you know a dry run
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.400]   the sixth case itself you know is interesting because it was the one that was referred by
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:29.360]   facebook rather than by a user and it involves covid and hydroxychloroquine you know who's favorite
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.760]   drug a video about frances refusal to authorize hydroxychloroquine and azithromycinous treatments
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:42.320]   for covid-19 what this what this description is missing is was it advocating it was it complaining
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.840]   about what was what was the videos message was it pro hydroxychloroquine in which case
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.120]   face it was yeah facebook taking it down would be well in the interest of public health there's
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.840]   no evidence of hydroxychloroquine is good for anything so this is promoting moved out of the
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   policy for violence and incitement oh so i guess we're gonna have to watch the video to
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.160]   understand maybe it was saying burn down all the hospitals because they won't use hydroxychloroquine
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.720]   i think i think to jeff's point one of the problems is that facebook does have a north star and the
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:25.200]   principle is that connecting people is good connecting people is good if so facto right and so
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.760]   as insufficient there's always said that that's that's always a great that's always what mark said
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:36.080]   yeah as long as you connect people there will be the the arc of justice will right yeah so we will
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:44.160]   connect we will connect vicious Buddhist monks with you know weger with populations of in mian
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.480]   mara that they want to get rid of and boom we connect with people yeah job done it's connection
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:56.960]   that's interesting yeah good article uh i recommend it cj r this is a trench i think
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.400]   matthews trench analysis is right again it's trenchant it's obscure and that's the idea
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:11.440]   yeah yeah i think it's doing its job what's app is uh pissed they're pissed at apple
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:20.800]   because apple how dare they says uh you know if you're going to be an app on the ios platform
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.120]   you have to let people know what your privacy policy is and they apples actually got this new
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.080]   they call it a privacy label that will be visible in the app store that describes their
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.360]   intent is to describe just like nutrition labels in a clear and easily understood way what
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:44.080]   an app is doing what data it uses to track you what data it links to you what data is not linked
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.400]   to you what's app says well besides the fact they don't want to do it
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.560]   that they're mad that apple's not doing it for their own messaging app which i would be angry to
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.160]   except they're enough except that apple said no we are going to do it
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:07.280]   this is our wild garden and these are our rules and yeah rules apply to us it is it is a good point
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.440]   that i think sometimes the apps that come with the iphone the apps apple makes
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.920]   are uh have advantages that other apps do not but apple responded and maybe they hadn't planned
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.360]   to but once they got the attention from this apple said oh no no we're going to have that
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:31.760]   privacy label for our our apps as well so i don't know facebook went away and said okay we'll never
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:41.840]   mind never mind never mind okay i'm sorry uh i think this is a good thing and i understand
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.080]   advertisers don't like it either and there's a lot of people don't like it but uh i think it's a good
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.840]   thing and honestly facebook if you want to avoid the scrutiny of 46 states and guam
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.840]   they're probably a good idea if you kind of embraced some of these pro privacy things
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.200]   it's not nobody it's not going to hurt you you got to understand this it's not going to hurt you
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.360]   because not only that people will still do it even if they see it right i was going to say
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.360]   as you can see labels how many people stop eating things because the nutrition
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.960]   they're making that weird sugar coffee they don't care look at the look at it from a regular
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.320]   person standpoint you remember when hip-hop albums started getting the parental advisory
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.560]   label on it that they sold more it sold more probably yeah yeah that was tipper gore remember
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:34.320]   she wanted a parental advisories because kid the bs uh is rude or any try to post
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.480]   yeah it's going to get a total of words on regular spread consumer looking at that app in the
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.520]   app store they will not even see the badge they're just right because they hear about someone using
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.800]   app because that's the nice hip thing to do and they're going to run and install it period and
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.840]   you know now for things that they shouldn't be installing
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.480]   so what's this label going to do jeff made a good point the warnings on the president's tweets just
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.080]   increased the the readership didn't increase i'm sorry aunt i didn't hear you speaking i didn't
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.600]   mean talk or read it's okay no you're good it's uh you know technical it's uh people understand that
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.040]   if we were all in the same room that wouldn't happen but because of the technology we use uh i mean
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.080]   look at the look at the health information on a twinkie you know they sell 800 million of those
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.120]   and yeah don't you take those twinkies they're good
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   you know i had a twinkie in a long time i just had a twinkie the other day and it has a nice little
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.880]   lemony flavor in there i'd probably even been in it it's been an i think they i think they get away
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.000]   with it because it's not actually food there's no food products in there it's just why did you have
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.880]   a twinkie what made you have a twinkie well there was one in the house that's usually how i get them
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.720]   because i don't buy them but they tend to show up here and in the count on the counter yeah it was
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.640]   one in the house i saw twinkies oh it was just one it was a box box of twinkies i thought you know i
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.200]   haven't had one of those i don't remember maybe i never had one of those it's like copized chicken
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.880]   sandwich how do we end up with a box of twinkies oh i know why there's a box of twinkies we've got an
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.280]   18-year-old in the house all right why else would there be a box same reason they're in
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:22.720]   aunt's house that's exactly why it's nailed it it's not it by oh yeah of course but you ate one
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.560]   well and it was and it was grabbing my coffee he stuck it right next to the coffee stand so it's
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.840]   hey what are you gonna do it was it was quite delicious i don't it's pretty soon it's a cake
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.600]   pretty soon twinkie twinkie truck is packing up to aunt's house
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:47.840]   it's just a little bit of sponge cake with some unknown cream inside sure it is yeah sure it is
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:56.640]   yeah it works yeah twink we had something the half-loon moon that we used to eat and the joe slui
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:05.520]   yeah there's twinkie the kid look at that twinkie the the vanishing editor i used when i was a tv
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.760]   critic at at people now not tv guide but when i wanted to disparage a show i called i often called
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.920]   them twinkie until the managing editor called me on it and said i had used the word twinkie as
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.760]   an adjective too often and i was forbidden to use it i think i would hope he would say that almost
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:29.680]   immediately i used to call things that were um badly made uh mecky mouse oh that was something
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:37.520]   like and we got a letter from disney disney said uh c-sandesists like wait a minute here's
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:45.600]   most is twinkie flavored coffee for sure oh man you get ding dong snowballs or you're killing me
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:52.720]   shark jumped and and you blend it into that answer that's the pods then you're putting your
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:01.200]   twinkies no put it in your donga dongana coffee oh there you have your cross-end streams
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   okay when we get to this point in the show usually the one-time lane segregation is okay
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:17.200]   keep the twinkie and the coffee separate but equal it's okay
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.440]   um i don't know i don't know i want to take a little break come back we still have a change
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.160]   log to do there's lots more to talk about uh matthew engram is here he's uh the chief digital
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.680]   writer at the columbia journalism review that's a pretty prestigious title matthew i on the twitter
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:42.720]   one team is there a chief pritt writer uh no i don't believe there's no it's like maybe they made up
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.560]   that title for you matt is that that's a little long old time what
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   i use a typewriter dammit uh also with us mr jeff javis who is a digital native by these days
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:11.200]   former tv guy critic and p and people magazine and uh a twinkie user no no no user could accuse me
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.800]   of many things i have my katia way pepe out of the mic honestly i don't need twinkies i think a katia
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:23.760]   and pepe and a twinkie probably nutritionally not so different i'm just saying not at all maybe
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.600]   i'm just saying yeah answer the guy he's the hands-on wellness our coach here for photography and wellness
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:36.960]   twit.tv/hop and how our show today brought to you by bandwits this is actually a google
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.680]   story in a way because if you use google voice if you do calling with google
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.720]   apps you're using bandwits they're what's called a c-lek that's what they are they're a competitive
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:55.360]   local carrier but they are a cloud native cloud first carrier and that's what makes them
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:01.280]   so different really interesting company google uses them lots of companies use them
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   microsoft zoom uses bandwidth log me in uses bandwidth everybody uses bandwidth because
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.680]   they've injected the power of software into telephony with cloud ready voice calling text
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:21.760]   messaging and 911 built for the enterprise they've helped some of the biggest brands in the world
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.200]   disrupt industries create new products change how people communicate this is infrastructure with a
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.520]   capital i bandwidth apis are behind the scenes of google products ensuring quality communications
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.800]   other companies like microsoft and zoom rely on bandwidth to bring their most important customer
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:44.320]   experiences to life from sending SMS notifications at just the right time to making sure context
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:51.280]   center calls sound crystal clear to ensure reliable and secure 911 calling and this is all
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:58.400]   because bandwidth has its own tier one carrier network backing their api platform means it's a
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:04.240]   no middle man solution and the pricing structure shows it with greater insight into quality and
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.560]   deliverability because you're getting it direct from the source you're also getting a seat at the
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.960]   industry table many people use bandwidth i'll give you an example the co-founder and director of
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.800]   software development at rover philip kimmy raves about bandwidth he says no other provider offer the
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   same level of hands-on support or cost savings that bandwidth has been able to deliver to rover
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.920]   their flexible apis made it simple for us to get up and running without missing a beat join the
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:40.000]   big boys and the innovators who build with bandwidth get the power and reliability of a tier one carrier
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.480]   network paired with the control and agility of enterprise grade apis with bandwidth start a free
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:54.800]   trial of bandwidth bandw idth dot com slash twig bandwidth dot com slash twig we think of so much
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.440]   for supporting this weekend google and you support this weekend google by using that special address
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:10.880]   bandwidth dot com slash twig let's get the google change log
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:22.000]   i am so excited tomorrow the biggest game of the year perhaps of the decade maybe even of the
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.840]   century comes out it's called cyberpunk 2077 and it's going to really be the test of google
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:38.720]   stadia stadia is the google streaming gaming platform works with pretty much everything in fact one of
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:44.400]   the things for me that's interesting i'm going to try playing cyberpunk on my new mac laptop and
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:50.720]   m1 laptop google released a native version of chrome so i should be able to do it if you've got a
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.480]   chrome cast ultra you could play it on your chrome book they've got a lot of triple-a titles and
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   finally they when they showed stadia it's more than a year ago now they mentioned that one of the
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.360]   things you could do as a player is live stream your games directly to youtube it all starts tomorrow
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:15.280]   i wonder why i wonder why that's rolling out to everybody and somebody told me
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:26.560]   i think i can play cyberpunk right now right now it came out uh about 25 minutes ago so
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.160]   and people are already playing it should we see if people are playing it on youtube
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.600]   that's actually kind of cool let me see real quickly
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:43.440]   i didn't this is spontaneous see if people are already playing
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   official gameplay trailer cinematic
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:56.160]   people first impressions i want to see something let's let's see something let's use that special
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:05.760]   google tool that says in the past hour here we go this is yep they're already streaming
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:15.200]   ladies and gentlemen boys and girls welcome to cyberpunk 2017 you see the lights come on as i
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.280]   said that they're supposed to be cool i don't know if it was cool ladies and gentlemen all right
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.960]   enough of that so uh this is interesting because as you know twitch is the premier streaming gaming
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:31.280]   platform microsoft attempted to go after twitch with its own service called mixer which quickly
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:39.520]   got put out of business youtube says uh hold my beer hold my beer and with the top game of the
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.800]   year it's available on xbox is available on playstation but but uh the fact that people could stream
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:52.160]   it right to youtube that's going to be interesting they also launched live stream hdr support
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:59.440]   high dynamic range and that's pretty exciting along creators to upload videos with more contrast
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.320]   more shadows and highlights a wider range of colors improved have and have you tried uh
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:12.560]   have you played with this at all uh doing hdr on youtube live i don't know what you'd have to use
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.960]   there in coder i think oh your your audio it's my it's my our fault go ahead
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:24.800]   can you hear me i hear you it was an oh okay it wasn't an it was us we turned ant down

[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.480]   the new hater aren't you and something else google adds apple music support
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:57.840]   finally to google assistant and smart speakers i didn't i mean okay
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:09.200]   there you go okay sure well sure sure that's big that's big um sam song and i know
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.720]   stacey would have something to talk about with this sam song has a hub called smart things
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:22.160]   it will now work with your nest devices well good now but soon next month yeah interesting
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.880]   interesting i don't know it's good when things work with other things things should work with
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:37.360]   other things right yeah um this is a big story and i'm not sure i think we'll hear more about this
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.000]   we talk a lot about something called fuchsia which is this kind of secret project google
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.600]   been creating a new open source operating system not clear it's not so secret right it's out in
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.400]   the open which is not going to work with it not anymore they just opened it up
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.000]   uh so traditionally when you're doing an open source project you do in the open you let people
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.200]   contribute let people play with it you let people see um they say we've been developing fuchsia in
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.800]   the open in our get repository for the last four years you've been able to browse that repository
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.680]   but today we're expanding the open source model to make it easier for the public to engage
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.880]   with the project we've created new public mailing lists for project discussions they have a governance
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.760]   model to clarify how strategic decisions are made they're in effect making it a more traditional
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.880]   open source project they've got an issue tracker and you can now uh submit
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.280]   to become a committer or a patcher so you can participate so apps amp should have been that
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.000]   earlier on well this is an operating system it's pretty hard to do an operating system
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:51.360]   with all internally by yourself i think this is smart fuchsia is not ready according to
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.680]   google's open source blog for general product development or as a development target but you
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.680]   can clone compile and contribute to it it has support for a limited set of x64 based hardware
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.360]   you can also test it with the emulator you can even download and build the source code
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:14.720]   so i guess we'll learn more about what fuchsia really is it you know androids based on the linux
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:23.440]   kernel fuchsia fuchsia has its own kernel but i have to think it has something to do with maybe
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:30.000]   replacing android at some point which has been the guess i mean do you have any idea
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.320]   what fuchsia would enable can you can you tell no idea
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:43.280]   no idea uh let's think animated dips run natively it's going to replace uh adobe flash which comes
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:50.400]   to uh comes to an end thick apple this today pushed out the last update to adobe flash for
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.120]   apple vase's finest violin playing fuchsia project values transparency with our community blah blah
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:08.000]   blah um fuchsia interface definition language fuchsia i i don't you know i'm gonna have to really
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.640]   look at this more closely to try to understand what it's doing is it a is it a general purpose
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.320]   operating system i that's the impression i get why what is it for so instead of blending chromo
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.480]   s and android which a lot of people thought they were gonna do with this inventing something new
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.480]   yeah and there are reasons you know that oracle case uh you know with the android api the java
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.000]   api supreme court is it's in the hands of the supreme court now that could be a reason to promote
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.400]   fuchsia there are probably other reasons google is going to change uh we were just talking about
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.000]   apple's privacy google is going to do something similar with chrome extensions they're going to
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:54.240]   change how they access data next year and uh the point will be to make it more privacy privacy
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:02.960]   forward um next year google users will be able to determine which websites and extension can
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.720]   access when they browse the web so it won't follow you everywhere once you grant an extension
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.960]   permission to access a website state of that preference can be saved for that domain
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   generally now when you install extensions they see everywhere you go so the more granular privacy
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:28.800]   controls on google extensions is that a thing not a bit hey there's an pruit there he is i remember
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.600]   i hear his voice don't call it a comeback
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:40.560]   uh okay that's the google change log
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.720]   we have so many other things here um the tiktok ban
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:57.200]   just an update a second that's still in the news that's still in the news uh it was tiktok was
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.960]   supposed to be shut down on friday the federal government cepheus the committee of foreign
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.400]   investment in the u.s and the president decided to give him a little more time to negotiate
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:12.640]   at the same time already one judge had ruled that you couldn't shut down tiktok now a second judge
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.200]   uh on monday fully vlogged ruling was uh based on the first amendment which i quite like this was
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.480]   a different basis but two of those said no yeah judge carl nickels of the u.s district court in
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:30.720]   washington said that the president overstepped his authority he used his emergency economic
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:37.520]   powers to try to put tiktok out of business uh increasingly i mean i don't even know if the
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.600]   administration is still going for this whole thing was a farce let's face it was a
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:47.680]   this week and that that's what i mean when i was saying this facebook thing right doesn't is at
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:54.800]   least a coherent rational thing but i mean it wasn't but the tiktok that's like saying like the tiktok
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:01.280]   thing you know a four-year-old could come up with a better case than like it's not that's a pretty
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:07.920]   low bar declare yeah yeah although you know you know one of the one of the things was well it's
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.800]   owned by a chinese company and people were saying well that could be xenophobic there's no evidence
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.640]   that tiktok is doing anything nefarious but remember the same complaint was against wallway and we
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.880]   said we can't use any wallway stuff and more and more we're seeing wallway do some things that are
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:29.920]   pretty reprehensible according to the washington post uh wallway tested ai software that could
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:37.200]   recognize a wegar a wegar muslim and alert police the face scanning software could trigger a
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:45.760]   wegar alarm that clearly is something the chinese regime wanted so you know and i mean if tiktok had
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:52.640]   any technology like that i would be 100 percent behind banning them right it was just a cliche
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:58.480]   or political move and then trump said you know pay us a bunch of money for when you sell it it was
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:06.480]   just the one more one more chapter in the most bizarre four years uh in american political history
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:12.960]   it's just bizarre it's like if there was a train wreck and every train car was a dumpster fire
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:20.400]   uh that was another trenchant analysis trenchant trenchant trenchant

[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.160]   bloomberg wealth uh tells the story of one tommy ziplier with 1.6 million followers on tiktok he
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:26.480]   posted a life hack last month saying here's what you do right there a guy named ziplier

[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.680]   zip as we as we call him so what you do is get like 20 credit cards that have all different due dates
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.480]   and then what you do is you max the first one out and then you pay for it with the other one
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.880]   and then the other one and then you pay for that one with the other one and then the other one
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.320]   and you just keep repeating the cycle and you live off credit for the rest of your life
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:57.680]   it's simple it's easy uh he said i know it's not possible but i also knew that people would fall

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:24.560]   procrastination mm-hmm yes big fan big thing apparently uh i thought you meant the band
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:33.600]   that is a good name that is a that is that is a good they are number two and are tragically hip
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.840]   in the canadian charts revenge bedtime procrastination no apparently it's a problem
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.080]   uh with chinese workers who are working so long so many hard hours nine hours a day
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.960]   six days a week or rather nine to nine 12 hours a day six days a week that they're staying up late
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:01.680]   there's even a name for it bao fuxing uh ayoi ayoi ayoi revenge bedtime procrastination
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:08.160]   reta it literally stands for retaliate to reassert control to reassert control i understand that if
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:14.160]   you've ever worked 12 hour a day you don't want just getting bed get up and go back to work again
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.960]   you want to have a little time to yourself so apparently it's a big issue i don't know why i put
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.520]   that the old the old joke with disney was if you don't work on saturday don't bother coming in on
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:34.000]   sunday yeah oh that's a good joke wow that's good that's good uh let's see what else um we've been
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.200]   talking all week about hbo max and hbo and and time warner and what 18t is doing they are essentially
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.520]   saying uh and this is 18t owns warner brothers remember it during the whole it took them two years
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:54.640]   to get the acquisition through the government uh and and john stanky and the 18t executives kept
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:01.120]   saying look nothing's going to change you know we're just you know there's there's synergy well
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:06.800]   things are changing uh they announced with very little uh warning to the movie theaters
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:13.760]   that all of their movies for next year starting this year with gal gadose and wonder woman 1984
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:20.640]   but all of their movies for next year will stream for free on hbo max you have to pay for hbo max
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.880]   but we'll stream once you pay for it free it's included at the same time as they released to
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:32.640]   theatrical release and it's pretty big months that sell your popcorn futures yeah
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:39.440]   amc CEO was kind of devastated so were some creators christopher no one's pretty
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:45.520]   yeah who would create a tenet and inception and a few batman movies he said some of our
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.440]   industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.320]   thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:01.120]   working for the worst streaming service there's going to be an issue of payment too because
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.960]   if box offices hit they don't you know i saw a story and i can't figure this out that they're
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.240]   i guess there's some kind of of prediction that it's in the contract and it's going to reach that
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.800]   level yeah um it'll be hbo max maybe write in some checks oh yeah well but but i also saw a story
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.400]   i didn't pull up because it was it got too nerdy but it was trying to compare even with even with
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.520]   this even if they pay what what isn't just stated it's still less than what netflix pay is to make
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:35.200]   stuff right so here so i you know we've gone back and forth about this initially i thought this was
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.000]   just kind of classic anti-trust behavior at and t you know saying all right now that we got all
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.200]   this content we're just going to uh lock out the movie theaters and own the distribution as well
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.440]   but uh number people in pluckling paul tharata and windows weekly said no this is just recognizing
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:57.120]   the fact that nobody's going to be going into theaters for quite some time yeah
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.720]   if they're going to lose money it's going to cost them a lot of money i also thought it was
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:09.440]   interesting that story that you that's in the rundown um sources said that that Warner Brothers
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.360]   c o o came up with the idea because they had a weak slate of movies and this was a way to
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.120]   basically hide the stinkers while still getting right you know streaming revenue from the good
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.760]   ones right maybe maybe cooking the books essentially
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:35.600]   uh and but it's also promoting i think hbo max hbo max yeah which has done quite well 12.6 million
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:44.000]   activations engagement is up 36 percent in the past month weirdly though only 30 percent of the
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:51.360]   eligible hbo subscribers have signed up they gotta get the shirt in the password was that
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:55.280]   what was that would you say it was just it's just confusing you don't know if you got it from three
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.800]   very confusing i can't figure it out to save myself yeah i think that's the problem
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:07.360]   uh i remember when stanky took over when att bottom he went into hbo and said we're going to be more
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   like netflix a week later hbo ceo Richard peplar left and went to apple tv plus and
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.000]   you know i think they are more like netflix but that might be a reasonable thing
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.160]   in fact that stanky said that ceo of atnt said look the comp it's not that
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.200]   theaters are competing with us theaters are competing with netflix amazon prime
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.760]   the competition is there's an infinite amount of content you can watch at home period
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:41.600]   so we're just doing where we're going to be where customers want us to be yeah it's good point
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.640]   yeah makes sense good good point so i don't i was slamming this is kind of classic antitrust
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.840]   behavior but maybe maybe it's just sensible playing you know to the audience
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.440]   um
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:06.240]   uh let's see what else is in here fire tv is adding local news in 12 us cities 90 more coming in 2021
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:12.320]   i have to say youtube tv is to me the best alternative to cable right now i'm very happy with it
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.760]   wow yeah i think that it's expensive but it's going to be expensive because the local stations
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:23.600]   uh are demeaning it you got to pay them i didn't see much difference between youtube tv and hulu
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.640]   tv sorry for the construction noise outside behind me but i did like the hulu tv
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:36.720]   ui the user experience a little bit better real and i didn't like that youtube tv would
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:41.920]   the history from whatever i watched over there would show up on my regular web version of youtube
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.400]   yeah and it just screwed it down that's very google where everything's all mushed together isn't it
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:56.160]   yeah i i far prefer youtube tv to interface but you know i guess to each his own why does dian
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:02.640]   warwick say deal with it people thought that she wasn't really doing her tweets
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.920]   right tweets were so good and they were insulting her so if you go down about three quarters away
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:13.600]   down this story she has a little video with a message back to the doubters they are pretty good
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:20.080]   she's 80 years old i don't know probably a lot of the youngs don't know who dian war
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:27.040]   warwick was but she had many many hits is i mean all the musicians know for sure i mean
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.160]   chanthi rapper went bananas because she really referred to him oh she said why do you have to put
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:40.720]   rapper in your name like we get at your rapper he's a rapper yeah she said referring to the time
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.080]   the u2 album was forced onto people's iPhones and ipods don't you think i would have warned you all
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:53.440]   about itunes making you have that u2 album if i were actually psychic uh november 14th did you
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:56.960]   know that the artists can see the names of the playlists you're adding to their songs
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.760]   your their songs do not spotify that was something to consider she followed this up by pointing out
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:11.040]   the titles of various playlists knowing that ho was spelled wrong in one ho ho very christmas
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.680]   spelled h-o-e she's hilarious
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:22.640]   can genzia millennials please tell me why you're always saying screaming or yelling why are you
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:29.280]   shouting should i be shouting as well thanks i don't know there's a video of her answering
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.400]   people doubting her i don't know what a hot girl is tweets dian work but a woman yeah but women
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.720]   support women in this house i'm happy to see kind people receive recognition that is all

[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:50.000]   after warwick uh tweeted about megan the stallions grammy nomination
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.120]   uh later she said thank you for telling me what a hot girl is even though i specifically asked
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:03.120]   you not to i love that if you're very obviously a rapper why do you put it in your stage name
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.280]   i cannot stop thinking about this like be saying dion the singer
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:16.960]   can genzia oh yeah we did that one um the weekend is next why is that it's not even spelled correctly

[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:58.880]   well hello and this is for all of you tweeters who have decided that i'm not tweeting my own stuff
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:07.520]   to you i want you to know i am and i'm getting a very very very good at it you see i have a wonderful
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:14.080]   niece her name is britney and she said that dion you'll have a lot of fun if you get on this with me
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:22.800]   i said okay teach me how to do it and she did and i am doing it so that's it quell all of you naysayers
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:30.320]   and if it doesn't deal with it she's just i'm following her i'm following her is it that the
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:37.120]   greatest oh my god she's having fun trolling she's so awesome that voice i mean you would just speaking
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:44.960]   that voice she sounds so good even maybe walk on by what were some of her hits that's the one
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:52.400]   that's the one she had so many though and probably a lot of christmas i think a lot of christmas stuff
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:48:00.720]   uh let's see she has the rapper talked about it on ellen's show oh he was so he was so jazzed
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.840]   you want to see red it's most upvoted picture of 2020 here you go
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:16.080]   is it safe for work it was not a surprise it's a photo rick astley posted by rick astley he's of
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:23.360]   course that never gonna give you up the the singer of the rick role never gonna give you up it's a
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.840]   multi-layered rick role i this is from i so here's the picture i found a few funnier memories doing
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:36.560]   lockdown this is for my first tour in 89 backstage in vegas following asli's the second most
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:44.160]   i've voted post from 2020 was a short story posted in memes dunking on a flat arthur's changing youtube
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.320]   titles and that's all right that's fine uh have you heard of the asli paradox no what is the
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:57.680]   asli paradox when you ask rick asli for the movie uh give you up never gonna give you
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.680]   he can't he can't give it to you never but he can't let you down okay that's a paradox
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:13.520]   that's a paradox um critical flaws in millions of iot devices may never get fixed
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:23.920]   so what else is new stacey so what else is new um i look i gotta go play cyberpunk 2077 let's finish
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.120]   this up oh this is good news and we haven't reported elsewhere and i want to i do want to talk about
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:37.840]   this the fcc has finally concluded its investigation on passengers using their cell phones in flight
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:48.960]   the fcc uh started this back with tom weiler in 2013 now seven years later they have reached a verdict
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:59.520]   no i don't think it doesn't matter no no not gonna do it the fcc says you cannot use yourself
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:05.840]   by the way thank you boing boing mark frownfelder for that clip art uh there's strong opposition to
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.720]   the commission's proposals for many cometers in this proceeding including our nation's airline
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:17.760]   pilots and flight attendants so no you can't sorry you can't use your cell phone in flight
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:27.600]   so there um should we um i think we should get to our picks of the week how about that can you
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:34.000]   elaborate on that one more time sir you cannot use your cell phone and flight well as in
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:42.080]   Wi-Fi connect make a phone call no they they so back in 2013 you remember every time you get
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.200]   them a plane they said turn you know turn off your cell phone you can't use it yeah and i thought
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.600]   that was because of the connection to the towers that was a lie supposedly it was all lying they
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:55.840]   said interfere with our electronics bullshit yeah both pucky yeah it was so the fcc finally you know
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:02.160]   said all right we'll look into this and it wasn't they didn't you know nobody wanted that guy sitting
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:11.440]   on three c and then i told him i am not gonna shout in his stuff all over the airplane right and so
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:18.560]   even though there is no well you're mad at me yeah yeah there's no technical reason why you shouldn't
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.800]   use your cell phone flight actually there's one technical reason but it doesn't hurt the plane it
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:28.560]   hurts your phone because the cells are moving so fast beneath you yeah the handoffs happening so
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:37.040]   fast that it will kill your battery battery but other than that um that yeah the fcc said no there's
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:42.480]   you know you know yeah remember nick nick built and helped uh you wrote about that and he helped them
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.160]   admit that basically right there was no problem with it that's actually he asked somebody he asked
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:54.400]   the scientist so i did a rough survey and something like 60 percent people never turn the phones off
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.640]   so if there was a problem wouldn't planes be falling out of this guy all the time exactly yeah
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:02.640]   yeah that that's huge that was a big story by nick
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:13.120]   um disruptions want calls on planes you'll need to speak up December 1st 2013 thank you for giving
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:20.160]   him some some credit for uh the expose but seven years ago who's his crusade he lost
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.400]   nick built although honestly he kind of won because thanks to nick you can also you can use your ipad
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.760]   you can use your devices you couldn't even do those remember
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.520]   so so you can use your computers and your devices on planes but you can't make phone calls
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:41.600]   you can't make phone calls it's funny i forgot about that i'm glad you remember that Matthew
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:50.160]   credit to nick all right our last commercial of the day and then we will get your picks if you don't
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:58.800]   mind in just a bit it's great to have Matthew Ingram here from the cjr from the fabulous uh
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:05.200]   i don't know i forgot the name of it craig namar cray newmark graduate school of journalism
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:16.240]   mr. Jeff javis and april from hands-on photography hands-on wellness her show today brought to you
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:22.400]   by linode i'm known linode forever had a limited account forever too they were the very first as i
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:32.720]   remember to offer virtual machines in the cloud running on ssd's super fast making your complex
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:39.120]   cloud infrastructure easy is their goal they believe in cloud computing for all they've made
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:44.480]   deploying managing and scaling cloud applications simple and they've been doing it longer than
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.080]   practically anybody else and they're still the best that's why 800 000 developers
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.960]   use linode let me tell you why i use linode 11 global data centers all over the world flat rate
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:03.040]   pricing on every single one i love the cloud manager makes it really easy to provision a server
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:08.000]   get it up and running set it up with the software you want and shut it down when you're done with it
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.160]   they have a wonderful api it's full-featured and maybe the best thing about linode they have
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:22.720]   the best customer support anywhere 24/7 365 days a year they don't hand you off there's no tears
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.880]   i'm gonna have to get my manager none of that and it doesn't matter if you're a big guy or a
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.320]   little guy because i'm a little guy they will take care of you doesn't matter you can host your
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.760]   website you could build your app it's fun for me playing in the development space you need a
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.320]   server out there and it's really fun for me to have a quick easy inexpensive server i could spin
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.840]   up and then spin down when i'm done and you know so one of these days one of my mvp is going to take
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:54.080]   off and then i can spin it up even bigger it'll scale one of these one of these days you can use
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.560]   it to backup media you can use it to store media whatever you want to do easily launch and enrich
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:03.600]   your developer applications hosted service you love you love kubernetes and docker it's great for
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:10.880]   that websites you want to do machine learning they've got gpu's they have they have machine learning
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:18.160]   instances you could do gaming services cicd environments you can launch in the cloud you could
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:23.280]   scale in the cloud start small grow big those virtual machines are great and we're going to start
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:31.200]   you with a lot a hundred dollar credit on s3 compatible object storage managed kubernetes and
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:37.120]   more in addition to shared and dedicated compute instances you are going to love lennel i know
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:43.920]   you've heard about it l_i_n_ o_d_e surely you have uh... if you have it get to know lennel

[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:14.640]   you know that you kick things off is it is it true yeah you're it's trenchant well i don't know
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:21.920]   about that it's pretty trenchant you're mentioned well the the link to the uh homicide video reminded
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:27.120]   me of this uh... julia styles clip from i think it was ninety four
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.640]   wow and she was in this show called ghost writer she was she is hilarious yeah
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:38.480]   she has this hilarious i think she was on the school newspaper and she was uh educating her
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:44.960]   fellow teen in hacker culture it's hysterical uh let's see i have a couple of picks i like this one
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.320]   i'm gonna show you this one i love what you could do online these days i'm doing the advent of code
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:55.280]   coding competition that's great fun this is for people who want to design a computer
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:06.560]   from scratch it's nand game n_a_n_d_ g_a_m_e_ no flash involved you're gonna start by building
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:12.880]   a simple computer was starting with a nand gate as the as the fundamental building block you're
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:19.680]   gonna build everything else your first task is to build an inverter you read to the left of the
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:24.480]   diagram for the exact specification of the task below the diagram further elaboration
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:32.400]   here is all the information you need to know this would be suitable for a smart sixth or seventh
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.640]   grader somebody who's interested in computing and it's kind of fun because it's graphical here's a
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:44.560]   nand gate we're gonna drag it into the space here we're gonna connect let's see we're gonna connect the
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:56.080]   uh output and we're gonna connect the input does it explain what a nand gate is it does it does yeah
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:04.400]   it's connect that to that oh i have to put this up here connect this to this let's see if we get
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:10.720]   the oh no components so it's uh it's an inverter has a single input a single output the output should
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:17.440]   be the opposite of the input so zero for one so we're gonna flip it oh what am i thinking i should
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:24.880]   put it on the top yep dummy dummy dummy do you think that's it john will i get it was zero out i've
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:31.920]   completed the level let's see no no i screwed up i kind of have to play with this a little bit more
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:39.440]   level is not correct believe me it starts simple available in english russian and chinese it's free
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:44.320]   although there's a donation button and you're gonna see here's all the levels and at the end
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:50.880]   you'll actually get a work in computer i think a great way to learn the basics of computing
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.840]   which more and more people should be learning because if we can you have people who can build
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:03.760]   computers what are we gonna do can you make something that you can play doom on no actually
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:09.920]   it's amazing what you can play doom on let me just say i shouldn't say no jeff your number of the week

[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:42.080]   from female i know that male trees release pollen and that's one of the reasons your hay fever is
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:48.160]   being worse we put in uh olive trees about 30 of them and if you ever had an olive tree it drops
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:54.000]   black olives everywhere so uh we only put in the mail except apparently there was a female snuck
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:01.440]   in there because now we got olives everywhere to six years at a very good time six years that's
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.600]   interesting that's why your hay fever is getting worse that's good to know number two in china
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.520]   a simple smiley face uh emoji doesn't mean happy it means a despising mocking even obnoxious

[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.560]   describing the decision as something very foolish that everywhere in the world has been
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.160]   suffering from ever since in fact he spent the rest of his life trying to design a non-squaring pixel

[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:14.560]   having a lot of extra additional free stock assets can help speed things up and i've been
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:19.120]   picking through it saw a couple different motion graphic templates that i have some ideas for

[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:11.520]   uh but lastly the main thing i wanted to touch on is a gentleman named darien rincher
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:18.720]   from the anderson south kakulaki also known as my hometown but he's also a senior football
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:25.360]   player for clumpson university he recently won the uh disney disney award for sportsmanship
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:33.920]   and in addition to that uh the same week that he won that he was he had a long 50 yard touchdown
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:40.320]   row in the game uh he's a like a fourth string running back on the team but what most people
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:47.360]   don't realize is he's the emotional leader of the team he's not a starter he's not the star
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:52.720]   but he's the emotional leader and when it was time to uh lead up things regarding the social
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:58.960]   injustice and protesting and and get in the message out he was the the main guy i like that
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:04.080]   everybody just corralled around him you don't have to look at that capitol link of him running the
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:11.440]   football running the for the touchdown when he scores the bench clears everybody's so happy for
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:17.280]   this kid because they know how much he means to the to the to the team and there he goes there he goes
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:25.120]   go there and go yeah all the way in oh that's awesome he's gonna be fine that life after football he's
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.800]   got a lot of different things going on he'll do a lot better if he doesn't get into professional
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.920]   football you know right i think that's uh that's really awesome but he'll have yeah i wanted to
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.960]   shout him out because that was a great story last week and it just sort of timed out greatly for him

[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:51.040]   everybody just and and again when he scored you could see the whole bench just took all everybody
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.960]   wanted to be down there which is clearly a penalty you can't run down there oh that's so cute yeah
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:03.040]   stay up to oh they're so happy for him everybody's down there isn't that neat that's a nice story
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:09.040]   when there's somebody who's in a star athlete but he's a star on the team because of right that's
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:15.440]   really awesome that's uh that's not you because you're also could beat the crap out of this so
