[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.680]   This is a subject worthy of TMZ. I can't wait. I cannot wait
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.720]   Can't wait to get into this but but as I started saying
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   You and Jeff Jarvis taught a class together CUNY, right?
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.920]   We did we just we just finished it was a course in sort of a
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.480]   Imagining do over what if we could what what if you were in charge of the internet?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.840]   Redesigning the internet. What would you do? Well you are in charge of the internet. So do it. Oh it was sort of that
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.400]   What a great idea. Yeah, did you come up with any designs?
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.560]   A lot of people are interested in in policy and regulation which is interesting. You know there's a changing the
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.840]   The way people interact on these platforms, but there were some ideas a lot of them had to do with you know
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   The way people treat each other ways to reduce bullying ways to help people get better information
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.200]   and and I thought it was it was
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   Optimistic was kind of the fun part about it, you know to see people in their 20s saying oh we can we can make this better
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.600]   What was interesting is that is that I didn't realize till halfway through the class that
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.560]   They all came on the internet conscious form
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.480]   After the early heady hopeful days. Oh
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.120]   Interesting one ran one class where he had a teacher about the early days of the web and about things that came before and they didn't know any of this stuff
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.600]   Right, it's it's and so it's really and these are these are graduates to me. Yeah, so they're they're in their tight
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.900]   I know it was really cool to see you know, we showed them like this was
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.840]   This is the way a bbs worked or this was Fido net. This is IRC
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.200]   It's kind of like chat except you're in these little rooms and they're like oh wow, that's neat
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.840]   Just or even just showing them you know Fido net which was basically an early decentralized network
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.600]   It was an internet with no, you know with no real server was that it got them thinking differently remember the one woman who did a
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.800]   Chew to a project where people would have to go to this community center to use a computer
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   She shoot and I was like well it used to we used to have cyber cafes
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.920]   You'd log on in a place with all these people drinking coffee was kind of fun remember. Yeah
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   Yeah, those were all love even ansel enough to
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.800]   Douglas is really a pirate. I remember some of that some of that we I mean
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.880]   I remember Douglas back from you know kind of the golden days of the early 90s, but we had you on the screen savers
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.400]   Oh, yeah, about 20 years ago more more than
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.400]   member of the cyberpunks, you know, are you serious and Krasner and Timothy Larry and
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   Yeah, that was my crowd. Yeah, the heady wonderful days my first book was called Siberia. See why be eria
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.960]   I got on the Larry King show. I remember any Larry King. He's like what is this internet?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.040]   What is it what is cyber space and I said Larry urine cyberspace right now
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   I
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   Think we interviewed you when coercion came out which was your
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:49.160]   Yeah, although I did it I did it earlier when you had a show before that that I was on. Um, oh, yeah the site
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   That was with sola dad. Yes that all of that was not wearing a kilt. I'm sorry. No
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   And what book was that we were talking about on that one? God probably media virus. Okay. Yeah, so you've been doing it
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.320]   You've been around covering this stuff for a long time. Yeah
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.440]   What's your dad? What were you gonna be before you got became internet boy?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.520]   I felt a theater guy a theater. Yeah, I was into theater what and I actually got
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:26.240]   I got fed up with theater because I was doing a production of three penny opera where the cheapest seat was $40
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.520]   And I was thinking what am I stuck in this elitist closed closed ended thing?
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.960]   I was I was sick of it. It was expensive and it was also the narrative in theater was so predictable
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.880]   You know crisis climax relief. It was that one same Aristotelian ark and I was into fantasy role-playing games and hypertext and choose your own adventure
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.200]   So I thought oh look I'm gonna go to the internet where money does not gonna matter to anybody
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:58.080]   It's just crazy nerds. You just want to have fun. It's not gonna be all that commercial crap of the theater world
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yeah, I wish it was honestly I think I wish it were that way Douglas. I don't do you feel like the internet has failed us
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.640]   Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I I spent as Jeff knows I spent a lot of time after you know
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:20.720]   Monda 2000 was basically usurped by Wired magazine, right, you know and the story of the unbridled collective imagination
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.240]   Was kind of replaced with the story of um, how are we going to make people more predictable through stickiness and surveillance in order to make more money?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:38.480]   And so so I really I took it really personally I guess that these these tools that were made for people to use were now being used on people
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.800]   And I wrote a lot about that and blamed
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.520]   Repacious venture capitalism for it almost entirely, you know, some great kid is it stampered in their dorm room come up with an idea
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   The venture capitalist comes up. Come on kid leave school in and freshman year and you know transfer parental authority onto me and pivot your company a little bit away from that good for people thing
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   And more for the get from people thing and but but now that I look back on it
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.480]   It's not just the money that that the way we develop technology
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.520]   From the beginning, you know way back has something to do with with a kind of a
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   nerdy isolation and fear. I remember I was with timothy leery when he was reading
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.880]   Stewart brand's book on the media lab. Mm-hmm remember the media lab. I remember ponty and media lab
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.120]   And I'm sitting with I haven't here. I was just
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:39.280]   This is a great book. Yeah, yeah, it's great. But look at that underlined heavily. Yeah, he was underlining radio
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.800]   I mean he's read it all in an afternoon and I'm sitting there probably high or something
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.440]   But um or doing whatever I'm doing. He's right now. This you tuned in and dropped out at the time
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.040]   That's yeah, I dropped out
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.560]   So he's writing all this stuff and then I'm thinking he's gonna say oh my god
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.440]   This is the next great thing and he finishes the book and he goes
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:03.680]   He goes first thing
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.880]   Only 2% of the names in the index are women
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.160]   What's with that good for you? That's early right?
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.320]   Yeah, but to say that 92 and then he says second he goes these guys
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.280]   Their mothers were unable to anticipate their every need and now what they want to do is recreate
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.880]   They want to recreate the womb with technology and have robots and algorithms
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.280]   Anticipate what they need before they know what they want and bring it to them
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.000]   And right just they're just they're afraid of women and they're afraid of people and they're gonna build these bubbles and and and leave us all behind
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   I was like damn
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.760]   Where'd we go? Right now?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:50.480]   We went he ended up being right and the kind of the Peter Thiel zero to one or or Mark Zuckerberg going meta
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.800]   Or everybody doing a derivative of a derivative of a derivative is that?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.520]   Escapism and that's what I'm writing about in the book really it's not just billionaires running to bunkers
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.760]   But the kind of the escapist urge underlying so much of digital technology because digital is a map
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.720]   It's a symbol system
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.400]   It's one you know one level removed from on the ground reality, which is why it's so tempting to use it to get away
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.160]   from all that scary stuff like nature and women and relationship and
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.120]   Humans so when you're talking about escape fantasies of the tech billionaires, it's not just two-minute man
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.680]   Reconditioned minute man silos
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.800]   Uh waiting for the the final days that by the way, which you point out they brought on
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.720]   Yeah, I mean there is that just the the most rudimentary level
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.160]   What I'm really talking about is that these guys want to eat kind of earn enough money to
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.360]   Insulate themselves from the reality. They're creating by earning money in that way, right?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.200]   It's like how can I build a car that goes fast enough to escape from my own exhaust?
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   And that's the justification that the the kind of the insulation
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:04.720]   Calculation that the that the epson printer executive makes when he decides well, we're gonna brick these printers after 5,000 pages
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.640]   And make people throw them in a toxic waste dump
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.400]   I know i'm destroying the world, but my margins good enough that i'm gonna be able to get on a mountain somewhere away
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.640]   From the climate change, you know, so that's that's sort of the the initial premise
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.480]   But where I go is to the what I is not just the escape plans of these billionaires like tio who go to
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.560]   Who want to go to new zeal under bezos who wants to you know get off the planet and the ultimate fantasy of white flight, right?
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.880]   It's it's not just that it's
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.880]   Ride your penis market to somewhere with there
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.320]   I know on your classes. I know did you see staphony rule? I used to love her. I guess I still do i'm staphony roll on msnbc
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   When he landed she's like oh my god. Yeah. Oh, jah. Oh what you did
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   What do you and what are we celebrating here? We're celebrating
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:59.680]   Something we did that six years ago with their rich toys exactly that one person can now do what we could do collectively 60 years ago
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.160]   Right who's winning the space right exactly him. Yes, they're not astronauts
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.200]   Uh, they're just flying their way to their little penis rockets to in cell land. Yeah
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.600]   You call it the mindset this the silicon bell mindset. Yeah, so for the for our audience
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   Tell the story of that you told me in the excerpt that's been printed of the of the meeting
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   Well, you know like you like you guys I get I you know anyone who writes about tech is considered a futurist
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.600]   Right. I'm really just a presentist, but you know people aren't watching they have no idea what's going on
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.680]   So, you know they they're just late
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.560]   Um, so I get called to do these talks sometimes
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.080]   High-paid ones, uh, which then gets me out of my
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.160]   bunker
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.920]   My own bunker here my intellectual social which I might add is well equipped with comic books very important
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.320]   But go ahead. Oh, yeah. Oh, you can see the uh, yeah, the audience has picked up on that immediately your graphic novelists as well
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.240]   So, but yeah, those are my comments. Those are yours. Yeah. Yeah, we'll say
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.160]   Um, all right. I'll bring them out. We can read them together that would be
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.520]   Yeah, but I mean I try not to do these talks
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.720]   You know, oh come talk about the digital future for this group of business people
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.840]   But you know they're paying good money and money talks and so do I so I got on a plane business class warm nuts
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.520]   The whole thing and go out to the mint. I mean, you know, they have more of you from business class and warm nuts who
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.400]   I'm still in a two thought of that form. Who thought how can we make nuts a little extra special because the
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   Because the people who are sitting there eating
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.600]   Every fifth corner. No, no, no, no, there's not just
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.160]   Thing that's what candy this is not like the candied peanuts you get for a book 50 wrapped in paper in New York
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.840]   City and written what this is it is but they make it feel so ramen bowl recently warmed
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.920]   I'm into a couple of cashews and a couple of cashews in there. No peanuts never
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.000]   No, those are cheap. So anyway, and they're lego them. So there's not real nuts apparently. It's a whole thing
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.600]   Did you know that? Yes, I'm not someone told me they're not nuts. They're not that's very confusing. There's legumes
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:14.080]   Yeah, so anyway, so I go out to this class. Yes. Yeah, I go out there way out into the desert
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.240]   Like driving three hours after I get out of the airport and thinking what the heck who's gonna
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.760]   What what rich people are gonna go this far and just as I get to the resort
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.120]   I see these g5 airplanes landing on this private airstrip thing. I'm like, oh my god
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.920]   What have I gotten myself into so the next morning?
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.720]   They come in a golf cart and bring me out to this like little pavilion and in my green room
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   like trying to practice, you know, my best Marxism offer it to throw at these guys and
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   They bring the five guys into the green room. They don't even mic me up. They don't take me anywhere. It's just five men
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.880]   Two or three of them actually where it's a burside
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.560]   One of yours
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.000]   Right and they sit there and they start peppering me with all these questions about the digital future like, you know
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.960]   Bitcoin or ethereum virtual reality or augmented reality. I'm like, don't come to me. I said beta max over me. Hs, right?
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.400]   I'm not the guy
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.560]   I'm not the guy to ask if you want to place your bet
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:15.920]   But then finally they got to the question, you know, Alaska or New Zealand and the whole rest of the hour was spent on
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.280]   Questions like how do I actually I asked them this they started to talk about their bunkers, you know
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:30.400]   Where they're putting them and whether they're going to protect them from the event and the event for them is the pandemic the global warming the climate crisis the
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.560]   social unrest the economic turnaround
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   Exactly a nuclear disaster nano, you know, ai whatever it is
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:45.280]   Yeah, very a gray goo and will it protect them and then they started talking about how they've got
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.200]   Navy seals, you know to come as to guard them from the likes of us because we don't have these bunkers
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.960]   And I remember first they all of them talked about Navy seals none of them talked about army rangers
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.720]   You know if I was gonna have a bunker, I'd go with army rangers. I
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   Why because they're not all land based their land base. Yeah, yeah, you know, thank you just oh but completely rising sides. I guess yeah completely
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.160]   parenthetically
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.880]   Yeah, I don't think any humans with guns are a good idea because as they're quickly going to learn that the guys in the bunker have all the resources
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.320]   Screw this we're going in and they've got the guns
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.480]   What makes you exactly the rangers of the seals are going to be any less dangerous to you?
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.280]   Which is why by the way, and it's one of our stories today
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.720]   The Israelis have figured out how to do autonomous gum turnets shooting at palestinians. There you go
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.680]   This is what we've needed all along was ai protection
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.000]   It's 1917 and the czar. Yeah, because honestly if you're going to protect yourself
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.320]   From the end times in a bunker. You can't let you can't let your guards be humans. You need ai now
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.240]   Exactly, and that's what I hit them with I gave them basically, you know a road map
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:05.840]   I said
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.840]   Exactly what you said. I said
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.040]   Why do you think these navy seals are going to protect you once your money is worthless?
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.680]   Yeah, if the world is over even if you got bitcoin
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.000]   What are you paying them with? Yeah, and there's like one guy opens his little, you know, moleskin
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   He's like, oh figure out how to do it
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.680]   Great. This is a billionaire, right? What am I sitting there with?
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.160]   $300,000 whatever in my retirement account that they say I can't retire on you know
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.880]   What is this so and then we spend the rest of the hour on that single question?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.520]   It's like wow, you know, what if we had you know implants that deserve to decide where people can go
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.840]   But then we could use them to shock people or prevent them or what if I'm the only guy who knows the
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.720]   Combination on the safe for the food or what if we bring in their families and then
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.440]   And I'm like and finally I say well look the way the way to make sure these guards don't kill you in the apocalypse
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.280]   Is why don't you try to be nice to them now and I ended it? I said to them
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.240]   Why don't you um go find your head of security and pay for his daughter's bot mitzvah?
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   There you go
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.200]   Between the eyes later. Yeah, yeah
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.600]   So so how did that then lead to the book? What was the process there?
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.440]   Well, I mean I left that thing in a state of shock right and a little upset actually that
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.920]   That the wealthiest and most powerful people I had ever been in a room with feel utterly helpless to affect the future
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.520]   The best they can do is you know wait for the inevitable event and just hang on for dear life
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.200]   and leave us all behind right then and
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:46.560]   Continue doing the worst possible things to us in order to earn enough money to insulate themselves from us
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.480]   When the bad stuff happened and I start tripping out on like um,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:57.520]   Thomas jefferson and the dumb waiter and the history of technologies that look like they were there to help people do things like
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.920]   Oh, that's so his enslaved servants won't have to trudge up the steps with all the food
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.720]   It's like no you look at the look at motticello
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.560]   Look at the tunnels the enslaved people had to walk through and they had to walk up like four flights of stairs till they get
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.800]   To the dumb waiter, which is one flight below the dining room, right and then
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.640]   You bring it up and it opens up like a like a
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:25.680]   Replicator on star trek but what what they're really doing. They're not trying to save the enslaved people labor
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.760]   They're trying to save themself
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.320]   Having to witness yeah
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.720]   Being slave person right it's it's the technology doesn't replace the labor in that case
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.120]   It just distanced distances distances the wealthy from the labor, right?
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.400]   You know amazon automatic t-shirts you still got people
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.920]   You know picking the cotton and and and getting the rare earth metals for the robots that are making you know
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.400]   Or 3d printing your t-shirt so there was there was that and I ended up writing an article on medium about this
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.040]   What happened? You know my encounter with these billionaires and and and this this
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.560]   technological
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   Insulation equation I was calling it and um I got this flurry of emails
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:13.600]   You know not so much from people who are upset as from the people who sell survival equipment to the billionaires
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.240]   You know like three different people with bunkers a guy who's got farms
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.040]   And people can't invest in it's like introduce me. I've got I've got the product
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.120]   I'm like or people who wanted
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.960]   Bunker expertise from me like more billionaires like oh can you come talk to me about my become the bunker man
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:37.200]   I know like I don't know anything about bunkers. I'm an anarcho-synticalist media theorist. I don't know
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.480]   One now don't you don't you kind of secretly want your own bunker now
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.080]   I got I got five gallons of pollen spring in the basement. That's all you need man
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.680]   And a box of band-aids
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.200]   I'm good. I'm good. You know what I did that point though
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:01.680]   This yeah, and it's the subtitle of the book survival of the richest your new book is the the fantasies
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.160]   Escape fantasies of the tech billionaires really that just follows along with with monacella and jefferson
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.520]   It really is about kind of escaping what they've created mentally as much as it is physically. Is that right? Yeah
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.280]   Yeah for sure for sure they they want to run
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:25.920]   I mean and and when I decided to write the book was actually during covid and I felt a bit of the
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.200]   Preper isolationist billionaire in myself
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.480]   You know I looked at some neighbors who were wealthy enough to get private tutors for their kids
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.280]   And they had this like little makeshift school in their backyard
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.640]   I mean I was you know and rather than feeling guilty about my amazon prime and fresh direct account now
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.840]   I'm like oh thank god. I got amazon prime right I could just stay home
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.640]   I'll get one of those little video doorbells and just sit there wait till the guy comes drops it off
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.760]   Wait like you know a couple hours go out with my bleach right and wipe down my stuff and bring it inside
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.360]   Maybe in addition to my netflix now i'm gonna get disney for the kid
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.560]   And I always wanted criteria and to see what's on there hbo max
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.440]   I mean I started stacking up the cable services, you know got the barbeque going in the back
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.800]   It's like
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.640]   I became like a little bunker person a man bunker man. Yeah
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:20.000]   How many any bunker person so I saw it in in in all of us our our response to crisis was very
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.600]   Uh very individual very non-non-teen player, but essentially hide your head in the sand
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.880]   Yeah, and that's when I decided I got to write this thing
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.440]   And then when I started to write it I realized that this is not a new thing that if you trace all the way back
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.360]   I really looked at there's two main lines that lead to this mindset
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:47.520]   The first one was you know empirical science and technology if you look at frances bacon is considered the father of empirical science when he was arguing
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.800]   For the logic of science. He said science will let us take nature by the hair
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.160]   Hold her down and submit her to our will wow
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.800]   All right
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.160]   So what is science for nature is this wild woman?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:09.200]   Right this scary wild room we're gonna just take her by the forelock hold her down and so it's a domination fantasy that science will
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.240]   Let us dominate nature. It's not going to surprise us anymore
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   You know and that's that's a little weird and then you've got capitalism
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   You know and colonialism which which you all know about and you look at a guy like a Hobbes, right?
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.120]   The great philosopher they teach us in high school when he was talking to the British East India training company
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.480]   You know what he's saying go to the new world. You don't have to treat those native americans like people at all
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.680]   Right they're just part of the landscape. They're like tigers and trees and shrubs. You can don't worry
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.280]   Just kill them, right?
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.080]   And so you have you have capitalism that has this this kind of colonial
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   Ethos as well that any harm you're doing is an
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.200]   Externality right your your iPhone, you know, you're everything about your iPhone is just here
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   Right don't worry about where it came from the people in China jumping out of buildings or whatever with the nets where they got nets
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.920]   They'll be fine. There's net or don't worry about what happens when you know
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.560]   He comes out with iPhone 15 so you're gonna throw out your iPhone 13 and get a 14 or whatever
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:14.480]   You know, don't worry about the toxic waste dump either. That's that that externalization of harm from from you know
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.680]   From a capitalist perspective is is is kind of the same the thing and when they come together
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:27.520]   With the with digital kids who've been and I call them kids these you know the young billionaires who've been you know plucked from college
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.320]   at
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:34.240]   Freshman year before they've had a chance to take economics or ethics or anthropology or sociology or anything
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.600]   And they transfer parental authority onto a peter teal who has them pivot their business from social
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.320]   good to uh social extraction
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.040]   Um, you get uh, you get the mindset and you get these people as as i'm sure they've been on your show who were like making
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.720]   And selling products that they won't let their own kids use right their kids are going to rutov
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.280]   Steiner's goals. They got a goat share up in tepanga somewhere, you know while they're
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.880]   You know selling god knows what to to you and me
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.080]   No, mostly we have an arco cynicalists on like you
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.880]   Frankly, oh good because well it is i'm being a little facetious, but it's not really
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.080]   I would far prefer to talk to people like you and kori doctor ro
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:21.840]   Uh and on and on and on then or and timothy leery if you were still with us, uh, then mark zucker bird bill gates
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.200]   Yeah, it's a you say you so it's a kind of almost this hobsie and we've got to dominate
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.680]   Uh that is driving our entire economy in our entire society
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   the people who are dominated
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.600]   Uh are the ones who complain but those who are dominating or hope to be dominating love it
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.920]   How do you change their to their mind? I mean they're they're winning winning
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:52.320]   They are winning. Well, I thought the essence of the internet is a threat. Yeah is because the dominated can now be heard
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:59.200]   And and so that to my mind, that's the reformation and what we see happening on january 6th is the counter reformation
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.440]   Is the one gonna hold back that's a very interesting point. Yeah, well we gave these these weaklings of voice. What a mistake we made
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.240]   Uh, let's quick. Well yank that back. Yeah
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.080]   I mean, yeah, when you look at you know movies like social dilemma when you see all the millionaire tech bros going
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   Oh, maybe we made a mistake here. It's like you didn't read your postman. You didn't read
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:26.240]   Anybody it was like we've been for 20 years. You've been making them say oh, I woke up and I realized i'm gonna now make everything
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   Cheeks
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.760]   But when did they wake up it was not because people were in pain
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.600]   They woke up because donald trump was elected and they got scared is why they
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.480]   Oh
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.640]   Yeah, it was a little a little late buddy. You know, but let's I mean government has always been from
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.800]   From the very begin for monarchies now down to capitalism to democracies about
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   Preserving the social order and who benefits from the social order
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.520]   The you know the people on top
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.720]   Keeping keeping you know poor people and black people hating each other so that they don't bear up die, you know combined to take over
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.360]   Uh, that's from time immemorial. You're you're proposing to overthrow
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:16.480]   The single dominant way of life in this society. Well, well, I mean I think actually
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.120]   Uh, healthy society has a balance of government and commerce
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:29.760]   You know, I feel like like like business or corporations and government kind of balance each other out like like fungus and bacteria in your body
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.920]   You get rid of one and the other one runs rampant and that's what we did what we foolishly did
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.840]   I remember, you know 1995 or 6 john barlow wrote the declaration of independence of cyberspace
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.120]   You know grateful dead lyricist. We didn't realize he was also dick chinese room mate in college right?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.920]   Oh
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.480]   Yeah, okay full libertarian interesting dude. I mean wonderful guy
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.720]   He writes this thing and he he says, you know at the beginning governments of the where you know governments of the world
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.560]   Beware we are here. We don't need you. We're gonna make our own thing. We don't eat your damn rules and all of us are like
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   Yeah
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.960]   We don't need government and the reason we were like that is because government other than making the internet cast itself
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.560]   Is the enemy of the internet remember it was a operation sun devil
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.480]   They're going and raiding like 14 year old kids for hacking into a shopping mall and like what your hands were on your back machine guns
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:31.040]   You know put your sister on that get down. You know, it's like my god. What are they doing it and tipper gore with a computer and decency act
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   It's like everything
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.840]   It's worse now the legislation that's coming out in the u.s and the uk
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.160]   A legal but harmful content things that are harmful the paternalism
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.920]   Of and the protectionism of the of the formerly powered is getting worse of it
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.120]   Right, right? They don't know how to play with this. They don't know how to promote
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   They don't know how to promote civics online, which would be their strength
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   They just know how to repress stuff that they're scared of right and so then they make themselves the enemy
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.320]   And then we're more open to facebook and and whoever else wants to dominate the space
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.440]   But it is so it's been this way trick the time immemorial. I don't know
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.640]   uh, the part of the problem is
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.160]   Of course, you maybe we're seeing it starting to see I always gain hope when I see what's going on for instance in iran
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.280]   with um women revolting and burning their habebs, uh or
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.560]   You know occasionally you'll see these outbursts
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.280]   Uh what's going on in russia after someone yeah after someone gets beaten to death
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.320]   Yeah, but yeah after it affects people's and I always am hopeful that maybe someday the people can rise up
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.320]   And and try to form a new way of thinking but it never
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.600]   But that well, that's why that's why reformation counter information leo
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   I think that you know and and
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:53.200]   But the reason it never works is because the power is inherently in the hands of the dominant
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.480]   Well, it is a hobby or it takes a long time to to work to some extent
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.880]   Right after looser came came all kinds of crazy
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.600]   Peasant revolts and looser turned against him because he said what the hell have I unleashed here
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.800]   Yeah, because ultimately no one wants uncertainty
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:19.040]   Uh, no one wants upheaval. We we all just want to leave yeah lead our lives and so that's we end up letting these guys run it
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   Yeah, but I feel like the the the most successful people at
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:29.680]   Evading domination. Usually don't take take the dominators on
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:37.200]   Head-to-head, but create an alternative. There you go. Yes. That only they understand. So I mean
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   it's easiest to see in the history of
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.520]   black americans, right the black americans were not allowed to participate in the regular economy
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:54.000]   So in their towns they created their own circular economies and it turned out when you're disconnected from the giant sucking sound of corporate america
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.080]   You end up having a circular economy and people were investing in one another and creating
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.920]   Mutual aid and they did better than their white counterparts
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.560]   So their white counterparts went and attacked them and killed them because I how could you be doing better than us?
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.160]   If you've been cut off from the economy, it's precisely because of it also you say
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.040]   Yeah, exactly
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:18.880]   Exactly because because they were using the what we're now be considered in white culture state of the art
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:26.160]   You know a platform cooperative or some new neo alternative currencies and and you know, it's like yeah
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.880]   They were doing it since like 1810. Thank you very much
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.680]   And then I'm even thinking about like augmented reality people were asking me. I was just on a show where they said what do you what is the
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.440]   most creative use you've seen of augmented reality and I said um
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.120]   Yeah, I said the underground railroad. Oh wow
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.040]   They put symbols on houses. So you would know this is a safe area. This one has a dog
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   This one's dangerous or the hobo markings. Yeah, the hobo markings on trains exactly
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.520]   That's augmented reality and if we use that as our model love it then the technology becomes
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.840]   Liberty rather than then dominating. I think there's always been and you're part of it
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.840]   but the kind of uh
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   Underclass and under subculture of artistic creative people who have wanted to see it another
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.880]   Uh way who was it? Uh, I think it was uh
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.480]   Joseph Campbell said if you don't like the culture make one of your own if you don't like the dominant culture make one of your own
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.880]   We've always had subcultures, but they've always been kind of little ferments that bubble and then disappear
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.680]   Uh in the in the larger dough. It's also about publics and counter-publics
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.960]   Um, you know the the the hopper-ross argument that we end up with one public sphere one public
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.680]   Is a is a dominant way of looking at the world
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.400]   Everyone will be like me or what I want the world to be as opposed to realizing that the world has always been made up of competing
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:54.000]   Publics and the communities there's always been we're all in different. It's competing publics, but the game is rigged
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   We know who's gonna win in the long run, right?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.520]   Well, um
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.160]   No in the long run luther did pretty well
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.720]   When it's also what do you define? How do you define winning?
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   You know and that kind of goes back to my my billionaires they define winning in a in a finite game, right?
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.440]   Winning means rising above everybody else, right winning. I mean even I mean even god bless
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:27.120]   Even my dad used to tell me and it was without any evil. I think he was raised in the tenements of the lower east side
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.000]   What he called the slums, you know, they all nine of them in out in a in a tenement
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.600]   There was a bucket they used as a bathtub in the kitchen. It was all hard and he was I worked hard
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.480]   I went to school. I made money to get out of that neighborhood so I could raise you somewhere better
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.720]   So that's the way we think about it lifting ourselves up and out is winning
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.520]   But what about when the world is your bad neighborhood, right? You can't be so
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.480]   They said this is a bus is going and there's not so you're not the virgin guy over there
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.480]   So then you have these um, you know, I mean a lot of uh fiction authors have talked about it like William Gibson these kind of little
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.000]   mini cyberpunk you were a cyberpunk uh
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.600]   Subcultures that somehow thrive and survive below the surface. Is that the is that the future you want?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.560]   Or do you want to become dominant?
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.520]   And then just like ever because with all due respect
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:27.520]   Yeah, luther survived by by Protestantism survived but by becoming the dominant and suppressive
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.200]   Mechanism in many countries and power grows, right?
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.720]   Yeah, so is it the power that corrupts or is it human nature that as soon as you get in charge
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.640]   Look Douglas is really investigating right was what was the chicken and egg there?
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.440]   Is it the one of the realization that you have the power or is it the money and then you want to protect it?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.320]   Uh, you get the money so you can have protect the power or you get the I always you can I always come to the conclusion that it's humans or the problem
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.000]   What do you think that was?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.200]   Human's are the problem and technology is the solution? We can just not
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.400]   I
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.480]   know I I um
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.880]   I'm doing a kind of a disciplined thought experiment if you will where I
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:14.960]   I'm refusing to imagine a future and what I want in the future
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.960]   And I'm trying to discipline myself to create that future through
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.840]   Appropriate action in the present good. I'm with you. How do we do it? Let's do it. Let's go. I agree 100%
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.920]   I want to live in your future
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.160]   Well be it right now build it right it's just engender
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:39.600]   In gender the future you want in this second so we're doing it right now, right? You're giving me time
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.560]   I'm giving where we're and then we step away. How are you treating that person? How are you treating your
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.840]   You need and then it's in the moment-to-moment decisions that you make if you make them differently like instead of
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.880]   Uh, you got to hang a picture
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.600]   Right. Oh shoot. So I'm going to go to home depot and get a minimum viable product drill
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.840]   Right, which is made by some enslaved person somewhere and I'm it's going to work for three weeks
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.960]   And I'm going to throw it out there, but it's going to get the picture up or
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.400]   Who on my block has a good drill?
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.920]   Right. Maybe we should have one good drill on our block and everybody borrows the drill from joe
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   There's a good Marxist for you
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.640]   One lawnmower. Well, is that Marxism? I mean no, I like it
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.760]   Well, the problem with it is that with people will say is well
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.720]   Yeah, but if everybody's sharing all their tools like that what happens to the people working at the tool company
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.880]   What happens to the gdp?
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:39.440]   Right? So what we actually have to do is is stop feeling responsible for these systems that we've put in place
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.240]   And and I want to talk to the tech bros and help them understand dudes
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.280]   You are accepting the operating system of startup venture capitalism as a god-given
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.040]   Circumstance of nature. You are in a gamified
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.600]   Where you think you're the one who's always saying that we might be in a simulation dude
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.280]   You're in a simulation right now of how your company has to work
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.560]   If you don't take money in that way and don't sign that kind of contract
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.560]   You're not going to need a thousand ex returns and you're going to get to do the business that you want
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.960]   Are you satisfied with 10 or 20 million to take home instead of a billion if you are
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.000]   You could have a lot more fun at this. So it's really it's that it's it's engendering a
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.360]   A spirit of just sharing and fun
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   What we would call the an infinite game rather than selling your business to the mob or or you know the stock market
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.040]   You know where they're going to just run money through it
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.880]   What if you start a business that you actually want to run and keep and enjoy
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.440]   You I think
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.800]   Almost everybody
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.560]   I'm maybe i'm giving people too much credit have in the back of their minds as they're watching this
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.720]   Uh, you know kind of endless growth endless progress
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:57.280]   The thought that you know it it might be possible to do zero growth to create a sustainable economy where everybody
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.560]   Lives comfortably, but nobody gets rich
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:07.440]   Uh, you hear people say no more billionaires. I think in the back of our minds. We all think that would be kind of
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.880]   Right that would be the proper way to be the proper way to do things and then we go
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.080]   And we don't
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:25.040]   People wanting more because they work more so they're gonna feel entitled, you know, there's always that entitlement
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.320]   Well, I think it's the other way around. I think they work more because they want more right. Yeah
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.160]   So they don't feel safe if we don't if you don't feel safe
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.680]   That's right. If you don't feel like your neighbors are going to take care of you when you're old
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   Right then you need to have two or three million whatever they say you need to have now to retire
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.120]   What freaking species is there on the planet that collects?
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.880]   Why are deadmark and fiddling happy because they they have a safety net
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.680]   Right and it doesn't have to be I mean because we can't in this country. It doesn't have to be essentially organized
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.400]   Uh, uh, social safety net. I mean, what if social security? We're really just
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   Social security, right?
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:07.120]   And we know we see people act that way when there's a disaster. We do do that. We do come together
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   We do yeah the first week. Yeah
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.040]   Yeah, but that's the problem. We only do it. We also only do it the disaster and individual has a disaster in their lives
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:21.120]   We don't care. All right. We care about a scale. We care about us is is Ian hitting the whole state
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.240]   You're not getting the reset button. Well, I love your ideas are not. Yeah, let's hit the reset button
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.160]   Well, you don't do a control. We'll delete either. I mean you take a tech bro
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.200]   Right and send them to burning man and give them some ayahuasca. They have this realization, right?
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.720]   Oh, the planet is crying out to me. Yes
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.800]   It's a economy. I'm gonna sit for 14 hours in my car burning
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.400]   Right. Well, yeah, well, they get on the g5
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.600]   They get on the g5 back to san jose and while they're on the plane
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.360]   They come up with a i got a software stack exactly
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:00.480]   It's civilization. Let's call it game B, right? Yeah, plan B whatever we want and this is it. It's got education
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.080]   I did the education stack. I did the environmental stack. I did the farming stack the
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   Architectural stack the social stack the sex stack the religion stack and then or we'll do it out in the ocean
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:14.880]   Right if you like my nation you move up your little raft and attach it in your part of my nation the minute
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.520]   I do something wrong. You just detach and go to the nation. You like better right zero friction, right?
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:25.120]   Zero exit costs to move from it's less like shopping for your the civilization of your choice, right?
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.440]   And it's these it's that that turn key solution that that
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.840]   That we are with a great reset as they call it the control alt delete
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:40.720]   Mindset is is part of the tech-birthing. It doesn't happen. The theory of change is the actual change
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.120]   That's why i'm saying i'm trying to be disciplined and be in the moment
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.360]   It's the how we do it matters more than whatever it is that we think we're doing
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.440]   Love it and the responsibility and agency we have that was the part of our course
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.240]   Was a truck yes, it's the students that they had the agency responsibility to build the future of the internet
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.680]   Do they have a power alone? No, do they have to grab it? Yes
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:06.480]   Uh, but but but their actions now set the norms for the future their actions now set the demand
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.120]   uh in the marketplace
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.920]   They have to take responsibility for that and with the acknowledgement that they don't nobody ever has enough power
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.440]   It may be that we do have honestly, I think that
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:23.520]   This has gone on for so long. I mean remember communes everybody thought this is going to be the future
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.600]   Then there was co-living like we're just going to do it and it's going to be better
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.440]   And it always seems to fall apart and I think part of the problem is humans
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.320]   People
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.600]   Right
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.160]   So right but but especially frustrated dudes come in and abuse the situation again
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.640]   Right what takes is one person who says you know what with all these people being passive
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:51.440]   I could be dominant and run the whole thing and uh and it's over so and yeah, inevitably that guy or gal comes along
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.360]   Right, it's a seven samurai thing, you know the nice people in the town. It's like
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.560]   You know the seven I always thought about when I watched that movie
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.520]   You know how they have to go get the seven samurai to protect them from the bad guys
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.720]   So why can't the samurai come and just teach the whole town kung fu
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   You can do this
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:17.920]   So but we've seen it again and again, but maybe what's maybe there is a little a gap of a possibility here because we are
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.760]   headed towards a global
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:26.320]   Crisis that we are going to have to come and cooperate to solve that it cannot be solved by any one nation
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.240]   Any one group that's everything is negotiating norms
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.360]   Negotiating our priorities that that's and the thing that the issue now is that
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.880]   There are more people at the table than there were before more people who've always had a voice
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.440]   But something can make themselves heard and again
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:50.240]   That's what the old white structure resents and would rather burn down the fields than share them with those who follow
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:57.040]   But what is what is rejected as cancel culture or woke or any of those code words now is
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   People who didn't have the power before tried to take it
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.280]   And that's a process of negotiation in society. That's what
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.080]   How we should use these tools is not to technological ends, but to the human ends
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.320]   It is interesting that your book is about
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:19.680]   How these tech billionaires are reacting to this existential climate crisis by not fixing it
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.840]   By an island, right?
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.320]   Yeah, I mean they'll be happy to fix it. They'll try something, you know
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.800]   Take a little higher shoot some but just a case sulfur into the sky, you know
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   Some iron filings in the ocean, you know, there's the the nice tech
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.640]   Bro billionaires like bill gates who's like well, I'll just buy up all the farmland in america
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   And I'll administrate it better than they can themselves, you know
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.840]   There's those ones but again
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   They're they generally look at these one size fits all
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.280]   Solutions even the ones that want to do I mean god bless them right the you know singularity university and the x prize
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:06.640]   It's like we'll give a hundred million dollars to the best solution as long as it scales globally
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   Right and it's like no maybe
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.200]   Rather than one solution that scales globally
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.160]   It's like a hundred thousand solutions that scale
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.680]   Locally and that we can model off each other because nature is distributed not yeah
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.800]   It is interesting the labor movements are suddenly
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.440]   becoming more and more strong for a long time
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.840]   uh, you know it was the
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.360]   Cardinal orthodoxy that oh unions are bad and I think that's changed dramatically in fact
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.840]   I just saw a poll that some vast majority of americans think unions are a good thing
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.400]   Uh, and you're seeing it happen to amazon as starbucks and as fight though. They may apple
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:48.720]   Um, so maybe this is maybe maybe this utopia is uh is possible or is this just another
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.280]   Luther you don't worry about utopia
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.920]   So don't you have to have a goal don't you have to have a thing that you're hoping to achieve no just improvement?
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:08.400]   I don't I mean incremental improvement. Yeah, you could say yeah, we're leaning toward justice right for more people
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.920]   Right, but right but we need to engender compassion for one another
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.200]   I mean you I got it in the book you put a billionaire in a in a
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.720]   MRI machine and show them a picture of a starving baby and the part of their brain that's supposed to light up doesn't light up
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.360]   Really billionaires actually yes. It's as if they've had brain trauma because they're sociopaths
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.480]   They're sociopaths. Yes, but they become sociopath. They're not that way before the billions
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.880]   It's because in order to do the things you need to do you have to become one. Yeah, right
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.080]   You've got a very your conscience if you're going to become that rich because in your heart of hearts
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.600]   You know you're doing it based on the subjugation of your fellow man
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:51.520]   Yes, but here we are living on the platforms built by people with that sensibility
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.360]   Right, so we too learn how to swipe left on the stories
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.080]   We don't want to see until the algorithm learns. Oh, just don't show dug that anymore
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.440]   Right it doesn't exist
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:08.800]   Uh, are you uh, okay, uh, are you calling for um?
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:15.280]   What do you what do you what would if you if you were to issue a manifesto if you're dude
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.560]   How to do parry barlow? This is it? This is it?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.720]   No, I guess the book before this team human team was my manifesto
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.040]   You know and that was basically are you anything that brings us together?
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.760]   Um is our friend anything that isolates us is not and that we have to
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:39.200]   Um, we have to remember that in a quantized universe in a digital universe an algorithmic universe
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.720]   Um everything between the one and the zero is noise
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.400]   All the soft squishy stuff that makes humans human there are our ability to maintain
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.000]   Ambiguity over time to sustain paradox is is stuff that that?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.640]   Our artificial intelligence is an algorithms can't understand and we are we are so
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:08.960]   Uh, uh, uh, uh, in amored of sort of auto tuning our reality to conform to this digital substrate
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.720]   at that that we are shaving off what makes
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.960]   what makes humans truly human and that's uh, uh,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.200]   You know, just take that's what I want us to blame
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.240]   Right. Yep. So polling does that polling puts you into binary buckets. Um,
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:30.960]   Political systems do that markets do that. Here's the here's the product. Take it or leave it. Um, we have the opportunity
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.760]   One thing I try to say in the book. Well, I'll plug pretty soon
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.240]   Uh is that
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.440]   Um
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   We have the chance to do more than measure now. We have the chance to listen and listen
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.160]   He's not easy listening brings nuance. Let's sort of brings conflict and and and and and
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   Um, uh, uh, confusion
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:53.520]   But that's where we have to try to get to because when we reduce people to a binary
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.560]   We lose their humanity
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.960]   Yeah, I remember there was there was a time
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.600]   You were alive for this jeff there was a and you were too leah, um, um
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:11.040]   Yeah, no, where was the time remember in the 80s when someone would go into computing
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.920]   Like get into it as a thing their parents would be worried about them
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   Oh, no
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.840]   You could jotty you could have been a doctor or a lawyer
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:27.520]   And now you gotta want you to play video games and dungeons and dragons and then play with these these machines
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.560]   Why are you throwing your career your whole thing and
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.440]   Those were the good old days, right?
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.720]   because
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.120]   It was just passion. It was just it was connection and it was a choose your own adventure hypertext
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.840]   How does this world work? What is this fractal that i'm in and what's my relationship to the whole?
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.080]   It was a trippy wonderful crazy thing and I do believe
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.480]   um that that that
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:50:00.240]   Spirit is being retrieved because this other thing has reached its limit even the tech bros who built it know that it sucks
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.560]   Right, right and I don't think it comes anymore from the technology in you know, right?
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.600]   They sure key the technology gets interesting when it gets boring
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.920]   I think that the the what's what's interesting now is what gets done with it
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.160]   The scary stat to me. I don't know if you know those Douglas. I just saw this a couple weeks ago
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.680]   Is that within about a year american colleges and universities will graduate more computer science?
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.800]   Degrees than all the humanities combined
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.080]   In the 80s when I or 70s when I was in school it was pre-med and pre-law
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.320]   Kids go to school to study the thing they're gonna big make the most money at so
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.000]   It makes perfect sense. They'd all want to be computer science. We then we we then mischaracterize school
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   Because I agree that you and I think schools are different has a different purpose
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:51.920]   Most of the people who are spending 30 40 50 60 thousand dollars a year. They they expect a return on their investment
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:51:00.960]   Well, yeah, but why should why should corporations be entitled to outsource their employee training to my education loan?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.360]   Right my education loan is for me
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.880]   You want to train your employees you just do that on your dime?
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.160]   You know you're talking like a history major an English major
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:16.480]   You humanity's types you got no no clue
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.920]   Was a theater what was your major? Yeah English and theater. I was pre-med. I
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.320]   Accomplished of my own gonna
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:29.360]   We're gonna be your mom was from mom and dad. That was for mom and dad. Yeah, I finished pre-med
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   I was you know, I got high a minus average enough to get into a good
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.520]   Thing and then went took drugs and did theater. Yeah, thank god for drugs. That's all I can say
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.520]   Well, they
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.960]   They open your mind
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.120]   I have to point out though if you use no proper
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:52.000]   The billion air said I know that take the ayahuasca have sometimes have a different experience than you and I
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.320]   They are so shocked. I know
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:59.920]   Right whatever whatever you take acid in college like all we got to do is get the awful people to take this
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.040]   And they'll be you give a tech bro acid. They think they're god. Yes. They think they're god
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:11.600]   They make the machine elves who are running the things behind the scenes and they say hey, let's make a deal
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.680]   And it's completely different experience. Yeah. Well, it's what leery said it's set and setting
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.320]   It's set and setting determine the quality of your trip, you know, and that's the same set and setting
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.720]   It determines the quality of the internet too
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.800]   You know, we started this internet with a set and setting of creativity
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.840]   And sharing right it was all shareware now for 20 30 years
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.680]   We've been living on a psychedelic substrate of the internet with a set and setting of surveillance control and domination
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:45.040]   So that's why we're all having a bad trip. Yes, but we can we can as jeff might say
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.240]   We can reset that trip right by re by re establishing a different setting setting around this stuff
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.480]   And that's really what our course was about
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.840]   What if you were in charge? What is the set and setting? What is the mindset that you want to bring to this technology?
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.200]   What is the setting in which you want to build this technology?
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.560]   And you may get some very different results than what we've seen so far
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:10.080]   There are people doing that I do see people doing that and it's always very encouraging to me
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.640]   uh as a old hippie, but
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.960]   Sometimes I think we're we're fighting an upstream uphill battle
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:22.640]   Yeah, but like little salmon stays salmon. Yeah, the salmon make it right some of them
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.680]   That's what you used to yeah, fairs. Don't get you first
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.640]   Uh, I love it the book uh brand new it's out now you can read it listen to it
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:40.000]   Soon, I'm sure it'll be a podcast underline it throw it against the wall break the spine survival of the richest
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.880]   published by ww norton escape
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:49.040]   Fantasies of the tech billionaires and you know, I'll put in a plug for team human because that also is a book
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.280]   Yes, uh people should absolutely read because this is the this is the plan
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.400]   This is uh, this is this is what we need to do
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.800]   Uh to get how many books is it?
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.520]   Like 20. I think this was the 20th. Yeah, that's great
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   But i'm done. I'm going back to theater actually. I want to do a play about
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.360]   tech bros who go to south america to do ayahuasca
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   I can't wait. I do think ultimately
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.800]   Art is our final hope that it has yes
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:27.200]   For some reason art seems to succeed and go forward in a way that all of this intellectualizing
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   bookwriting
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:35.520]   Podcasting doesn't seem to to take but art can do it and and whether it's film theater
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.000]   Uh paintings photography music dolly right dolly
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.960]   Yeah, I will be
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.480]   Art can do it although
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.880]   It's funny that you told this anecdote about uh doing three penny opera with expensive seats
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.080]   I went to see roger waters who's also utopia nist and wants the world to be a better place and the seats were
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.280]   242 dollars and i'm thinking you know
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:03.760]   Yeah, and this happens again and again you go see these these people with these utopia and dreams
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:09.360]   But once you pay the the the price to sit in the seat. It's uh, it's a little bit more capital still got to eat
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.760]   Yeah, how do we support how do we support the creativity got to support the arch well?
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   Maybe maybe smaller scale perhaps, you know
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.160]   I think he'll be okay with a lower seat price. He's gonna somehow make it
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.280]   Or just or do a little community theater do it do what you do
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.480]   Value the roger waters you've never heard of exactly value the guy in the subway
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.280]   Yeah, and there's and there's you know the 6.5 million creators on spotify
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.800]   Yeah, um, there's a lot of roger waters in there and there's some schmums in there too, but no I agree
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.920]   Hey, it's been a pleasure douglas to reconnect with you after 22 years

[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.800]   Brilliant guy fascinating guy and probably misunderstood and misrepresented in today's culture

[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:39.520]   Now back to the show we have eliminated the dug rush cuff monitor. It's just the
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.000]   Cool down a little bit
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.520]   I forgot what an energetic fella he is. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He was awesome. Isn't he great?
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.960]   He's so inspiring and I feel the same way about it. Yeah, I bet he is if you can get a word in edgewise
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040]   I would
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.760]   I can't I can
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.440]   You know the great so so what was great about us is bookmarks teaching the courses
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.040]   I wrote what would google do and he wrote throwing rocks at the google bus right?
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.240]   Um, right and so you know we could we could counterpose each other but we ended up at the same place
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.120]   We ended up with this idea of trying to convince the students with their agency responsibility
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.240]   And I think I've said this in the show before but what Doug said that I love so much
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.800]   He said well Jeff. He said we end up at the same place. We just get there differently
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.320]   He said uh you want more good and I want less bad
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.400]   Less evil. Oh, okay. That's that's good. I like it more good less evil
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.200]   Um, we could do it with both
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.840]   Because meta has been ordered to pay 175 million dollars
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.880]   Not to a government
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.520]   Not to the fdc, but to another company voxer who created the walkie talkie
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   Messaging app you might remember
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.560]   Voxer went to a jury in texas and said hey
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.800]   We've got the live streaming pat patons facebook live and instagram live in fringe on them
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.040]   Uh
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.520]   Actually the story of behind voxers kind of interesting
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.440]   Founded by tom katas was a us army veteran
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.760]   Who according to the verge wanted to fix the shortcomings he experienced in battlefield communications
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.160]   After his combat unit was ambushed in kunar province
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.840]   In 2003 he and his team began developing telecommunication solutions in 2006
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.760]   They uh, and invented a technology that allowed the transmission of live voice and video
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:39.680]   Although it seems to me we had that before 2006, but yeah, okay. They invented it. Yeah, that's what this is
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.160]   We just said last just on last week's show
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.000]   We kind of said aren't we passed that you know apple versus amazon i invented the button no i invented the button
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.480]   off and we're kind of back into it walkie talkie was launched in 2011
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.720]   Uh now here's maybe a little bit of a smoking gun according to the court filings meta
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.160]   Approached voxer shunet soon after the apps launched
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.120]   looking to collaborate
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.920]   And then by a year later voxer had disclosed its patent portfolio and proprietary technology
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:20.400]   to meta but as often happens microsoft used to do this too. Oh, I guess we can't really reach an agreement to work together
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:28.320]   meta identified voxer as a competitor according to voxers complaint despite having no live video or voice product of its own at the time
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.000]   They revoked voxers access to key components of the platform
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.520]   And then launched facebook live two years later
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.400]   Uh, so maybe this was a reasonable decision the jury was unanimous awarding
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.280]   174 million dollars
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.000]   to voxer meta says it will
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   appeal
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.280]   I don't I don't know. I don't know. I mean by the way facebook still have facebook live
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:04.160]   Uh, yeah, sure absolutely. That's the streaming platform of uh, um, but mass murder is everywhere. I think
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's not well. I hate to say it. Yeah, but it kind of is. Uh, yeah shots fired. Yeah, yeah
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.680]   Um among others. I mean other people use it as well
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.840]   Um currency, uh, been a bad day
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.520]   Uh, bad week bad months bad year in the stock market. Thank you. You know the kingdom
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.000]   Uh, it's been bad britain too. Yeah, you know what's interesting though
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.240]   Uh as the dollar surges the pound collapses
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.360]   Bitcoin has gone up six and a half percent
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.080]   Uh, twenty dollars. Yeah, what's 20,000
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.560]   Six percent is new use. That's how far back everything has been
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.160]   Yeah, spinn uh, henrich the founder of northman trader markets research firm tweeted
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.040]   You know we've reached a unique time in history when bitcoin suddenly is less volatile
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.760]   That phy hot currencies
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.800]   Oh that hurts. That's got to hurt
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.200]   Um
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.360]   I'm not saying this is the time to invest in bitcoin just an observation that bitcoin is
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.120]   Is doing well as other currencies seem to be sinking
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:20.000]   Rapidly how has uh ether dong the sense the merge, you know, I think it's not been good for the merge has not been good for east
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.040]   But let me just look and see yeah, uh, actually, you know, it's doing all right
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.200]   Uh, it's let's look at the one month
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.680]   Tranit did go down quite a bit september 10th after the merge
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.000]   Um, but it's stabilized a little bit. We'll see it's not exactly at its uh, it's a little one year if you would
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.120]   Uh, the not exactly that you're high
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.440]   Um, oh it literally went off the chart there for a while. Yeah
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.480]   So, um, I don't know I think that there's gonna be there's a period of time
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.240]   Where people adjust to the idea of proof of stake and
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:00.080]   Uh, I know I have high hopes that ether will survive that that merge because
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.440]   I want other crypto currencies to adopt this. Oh, yeah more than survive. I want them to become a model. Yeah
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.920]   Um
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   meta also being sued right now
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:16.560]   This is a great story. We talked uh quite a bit about apple's app tracking transparency
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.600]   That was the little switch apple turned on an ios 14.5. It said hey, do you want to let facebook, uh, track you
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.920]   Say no option. Yeah, give you the option and uh, and most people took no
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.560]   Facebook wind and moans said we're gonna lose billions of docs. I think they said they lost 10 billion dollars last year
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.200]   because of this att switch
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:47.440]   Uh carl bode writing and uh tector it says advertisers most of them believe facebook cried like a disappointed toddler at christmas
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.080]   but
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.640]   Facebook also and they even said this in an earnings call
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.440]   Found other ways to get the same information. They're being sued now
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.240]   apple security researcher phyllis kraus found facebook was getting around apple's system
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.160]   By directing any link a user clicks on in the facebook app
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.120]   To a new in app browser window where facebook was able to inject a code
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.920]   Alter the external websites and track user behavior online without user consent or awareness
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.040]   So uh, they figured you know as one does they figured out a way to get around it
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:30.960]   That is now facing two different class action lawsuits accusing it of violating state and federal privacy laws including the federal wiretap act
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:36.400]   Not sure that's really the right law for this but uh, hey, whatever it takes
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.360]   It has been called basically a glorified spyware attack
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:49.200]   It's one of the reasons I actually don't have the instagram app. Uh, I don't have the facebook app
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.920]   on my uh on my phone
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.600]   Uh, by the way, there we talked about it yesterday. I'm back break weekly and now I'm regretting it
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.400]   There is an app that just came out called the og app. Have you seen this?
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.120]   I know you did that right? We were talking about this
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.960]   No, I haven't seen this one. Okay. So the idea is
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   It's using instagram's api to create a better instagram app
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.000]   Uh by stripping out the ads stripping out the algorithm
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.200]   It looks just like the old school instagram with pictures
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.600]   Uh
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.960]   Guess what it is. I mentioned it yesterday. I said everybody get it before apple takes it down. It's gone
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.160]   As of this morning. It's already gone. Why do you have to take it down?
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.400]   Sure instagram complained. Well, yeah, that's the thing. I don't think it actually violated any terms
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.720]   This is a public api that they were using
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.480]   Uh, I knew it wasn't going to go well after I installed it
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.760]   And then went back to instagram the app said there's been a security breach. Please verify your password
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.800]   Do the uh two factor. We're gonna call you
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.000]   And I thought oh, this is just punitive. This is just instagram saying well, if you're gonna use that app
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.560]   We're gonna bug you every single time you load uh
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.880]   og
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.760]   Um
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.000]   I really it's an interesting story because I really thought this might be
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.920]   A way of telling instagram you've gone you've taken the wrong route
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.600]   Uh, it was created by anch nanda and hartic patil who had just raised a lot of money for zepto, which is their um
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.160]   Uh shopping cart app that's done quite well. I think they just raised over a hundred million dollars in venture funding
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.800]   And I guess this is a side project
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.280]   Still in the androids door
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.360]   Let me just see. Oh, I oh jean. I wonder if I I did I deleted the app after it. Yeah, shoot
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.400]   Now i won't be able to get it back. Uh after i gave it a trial on androids. Yes, see give it a trial
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.800]   It's really nice because it looks just like instagram
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   Except it says og instead of insta and uh and it's it's just your friends
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.600]   You know, it's that it's that people you follow feed. There's reels at the bottom in store
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.360]   Oh, maybe it's gone. Look for the og app. That's what it was called in ios the og app
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.400]   It's gone. Oh
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.760]   Oh well
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.960]   There's they haven't gotten rid of the ads not that kind of thing
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.080]   I don't think honestly it's but i'm sure
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:25.040]   I'm sure that uh facebook complained to apple but um or insta or mad at whatever you call them
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.760]   But I you know, I use instagram quite regularly, but yeah, I admit
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:37.280]   I do feel a little icky sometimes knowing that every time I launch that app it the splash screen says a meta
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.840]   Property or something like that. Don't you don't you also just engage minutes. Don't you yeah? I understand that but
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560]   You you also have to kind of hate the
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.080]   Way it looks now and how it feels and they really prefer video and
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.040]   It's just not the instagram. I used to know
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.280]   the video stuff um
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.200]   Really, really bugged me. It's not bugging me as much now because the videos are starting to look
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.160]   More like the things that I care to see. Okay. Uh, yeah, i'm starting to see more
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.640]   um behind the scenes
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:17.120]   Uh, cinema stuff. I'm starting to see more photography photographers doing their behind the scenes and things like that
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.040]   Not just a bunch of
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:26.240]   Idiots dancing on the screen to some song that somebody else wrote. Um, it's actually being a little bit more effective even a couple
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:33.840]   Um, i'm seeing people do little quick tutorials little 30 second tutorials for things. So it's that's getting better for me
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.680]   See that's not instagram to me. That's do that on tiktok. I mean i don't i don't that's not instagram to me instagram is
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.720]   Photos it's about photos. My friends photos. Yes, i'm not seeing a lot of photos anymore 30 second tutorial videos and insta
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:54.400]   Anyway, it's not insta anymore. So the og app has tweeted yesterday night after we received 10 000 downloads
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.600]   We're number 50 on the apple store and i will add after leo loport recommended on mac break weekly
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.080]   And had an average rating of 4.1 stars apple took us off the app store users
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.400]   Chose og over instagram because we listened to them and built what they wanted apple. Which side do you want to be on?
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.600]   Uh, okay, we got dozens of submissions approved the app store in the past three months
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.160]   They requested multiple changes to og. We complied with all the changes they requested
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.800]   To fit within their guidelines
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.160]   There are other apps in the top charts that replicates instagram's user experience have been there for years
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.520]   So apple i don't know we don't know apple has not made a statement. I'm not sure why they
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.360]   Pulled it down. They said we're working to get relisted on the app store
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.520]   Until then to get an ad free and customizable instagram, please download the og app from the google play store, but maybe not
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:55.600]   Shout out to scooter x who just put a link in the irc. Oh, you can get it. Okay. Now i'm doing it from the browser
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.280]   I just when i put it in on my phone. It wasn't sure it is the og app from you and one
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.520]   E ed
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.040]   Now somebody i think probably Andy and not go pointed out
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.200]   Um, maybe it was uh, steven roblas that
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.880]   You are in order to use this you have to sign in an instagram. It looks like it's instagram oauth
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.960]   It's not using
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.720]   Something provided by og, but it's going through instagram to give them permission
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.360]   Um, and for some reason instagram did not block permission. They just made it unpleasant
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.760]   Maybe maybe maybe per maybe worried about any trust action. I don't know
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:41.280]   Now I I will say that the reviews here are 2.8 stars. So I know I have I had to look at that and
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   Oh now they want a phone number or a google account to sign in
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:53.760]   Glitchy doesn't load out of the time. Yeah, I think frankly metas. It's making a statement more than an app. Yeah, metas throwing a monkey wrench into this
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.000]   Uh, yeah, yeah
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.960]   Well, I have a feeling we haven't heard the end of the og saga
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.440]   Another way to look at this
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.040]   Is it's all a valentine to instagram
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.800]   People are saying I love the instagram that was why are you messing with it?
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.120]   Yeah, that's they should see that and it's not to plug myself here
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.520]   Uh, but when I was on on moonlighting glen gordon kara and the producer
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:26.000]   Colby and I complained so much about the show not being on and about all the reruns and he said thanks for the valentine
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.120]   Yeah, it means you like it. It means you want it
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.520]   Yeah, and people who want the original instagram facebook should have this metish and other sense to see that that they've got some
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.000]   Real value there on there and they're
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.160]   Pissing it off. Well
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160]   If douglas rush cuff were here
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.800]   I think he would point out that
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:52.560]   What this is all about is the perceived threat to instagram and meta and more meta than instagram from fate from tick tock
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.160]   And and this is a defensive action against tick tock
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.320]   Uh, which by the way meta does all the time instagram added reels they added
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.320]   I mean they were fighting snapchat for a long time. They had snap stories
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.640]   Story style features and right so the strategy we talked about this is sure you talked about a lot
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.040]   The strategy should not be to copy what everyone else does and say I can do that too
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:22.000]   Because that you lose your essence it'd be nice to for them to care more about users than they do about the competition
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.720]   But I think they're probably not wrong and thinking
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.240]   This is our platform to to beat down they successfully beat down snapchat
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   Remember the yeah, you know their goal is more global their glow is not goal goal is not to make
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.880]   Instagram your favorite app their goal is to defeat snapchat
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.680]   Which is the only so that so that they can be the only ad
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:50.960]   It's all about ads right ads on on meta and uh, and so let's get let's get the competition out of the knock them down like bolan pins
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:58.400]   And tick tock is the is big ad competition. I would guess for facebook right now much more problematic than application tracking
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.080]   Chipotle
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080]   Get ready jeff
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.720]   Chipotle is moving the robots into the restaurants
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.600]   They're also piloting ai that tells the kitchen staff what to cook
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.480]   Yeah, this is what this
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.120]   This is a tortilla making robot. They've been trying out
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.280]   It's made by me so tortilla making robot. It's a it's a fries all it's written. They're trying robot
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.560]   Uh, I guess I don't know how it works. Let's look at the video. Let's watch the video
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.320]   Uh, let's more cut looks complicated. It's called chippy
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:43.520]   Made by meza robotics make to tia chips. Oh, it makes chips tortilla chips. Well, yeah fries it
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.400]   It puts just you know, isn't mcdonald's has the thing that they put the but they put the french fries in the basket
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.640]   It goes down it cooks it comes in it's a robot. That's a robot
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.240]   Right
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.400]   Right let's the same with this with this claim of ai that drives me completely bananas
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.960]   Because it's well, we're going to use patterns that we already know to decide what to do. That's a spreadsheet
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.200]   It's not a i no no no no. It's more complicated than that by the way
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.680]   White cast also has
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.640]   From podray white castle also has an arm based robot called flippy that flips burgers
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.760]   Flip fries, but you're right. That's not exactly well. It's a we it is a robot jeff
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:25.120]   That's a robot just as much just as much as your toaster is
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.440]   It's flipping stuff around. I don't know. I don't know. I think your toaster has taken bread down and cooking it put it back up
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.840]   I will tell you however
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.440]   That one of the big challenges of becoming a manager and mcdonald's is understanding
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.520]   How many hamburgers to make for the big rush that's going to come in new that's true. That's true
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.520]   It's a it's a hard thing to do
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.200]   How many potatoes to wrap at ponderosa steakhouse precisely and and mcdonald's
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.280]   When I even went back when I was there in 1973
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.720]   50 years ago, oh my god
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:08.560]   Even then if you made too much you didn't throw it out you put it in a special
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.640]   White hamper that was then counted at the end of every day
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.560]   Oh, yeah for your stats because they want to know how much waste you're coming up with
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.760]   Well, they also want to know that you're not giving food away for free
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.920]   That's right. We had to count at ponderosa. We had little
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.840]   Sour cream cups, you know, we're going to charge you for the sour cream for your potato
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.680]   And then you get to buy about ten of them to get enough
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.280]   Um, we had to count the cups every day
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.240]   To compare with the crash register
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.000]   Uh sour cream cups sold to cups left in inventory
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.960]   Did we screw up and give away any any cups a human is cheaper than an ai to do that
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:50.800]   However, I would submit that finding the guy who can really make exactly the right night for a hamburger
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.680]   For the afternoon rush, right? That's probably worth something and I could see in it which it's ai because you're going to train it on
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.160]   As much data as you possibly can
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.880]   The which is also hamburger you
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:11.280]   You train the humans by going and saying we've learned from well 10,000 restaurants the way to do this humans can do ai too
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.040]   Absolutely, but yeah, but computers are officially. Yeah, it's just everything everything gets
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.840]   You know, it's like my mushroom gravy upon her steakhouse, you know, would you like a little ai on that?
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.760]   Yeah, like a little robotics on that would you like a little blockchain on that? I mean, it's bs
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.080]   Speaking of ai I mentioned this during our conversation with Douglas Reschkoff
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:39.360]   Israel is deploying ai powered turrets this to me should be a war crime. I mean I feel like this is
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   This is creepy as hell. This is in the west bank, you know, and if I've been through this checkpoint
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.280]   Um, the sohata street checkpoint in the city of hebron
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:55.600]   Which is you know a place that you go from the west bank into uh, juruslem
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.840]   and uh, the this gun is they say
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.600]   It's not a remote controlled gun. It's ai controlled
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.920]   It doesn't shoot live rounds, but it does shoot grenades stun grenades tear gas sponge tipped bullets
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.080]   Uh for crowd dispersal apparently it's not unusual get
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.880]   protesters at the checkpoint
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.200]   And so now it's just as easily fire bullets too of course
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.920]   And how creepy is that right to I mean, uh
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.600]   You know
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:37.360]   People's lives you're talking about here. Um, to let a machine automated machine gun
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:44.800]   I don't know that's very disobeying. I'll put it. I'll put this already trade. It's not gonna work well, right?
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.920]   Yeah, automation is always perfect. Yeah
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:54.800]   It's but it's also this is this is trident glib, but I don't mean it this way, but it just
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.360]   Don't they have any pr sense?
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.080]   Acceptance is like
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.840]   They don't know the extremist view of saying they don't know they don't want it. No, they don't know. Yeah. Yeah, they think this is
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.920]   Oh, this is good. Everybody everybody's there the guys really good guys. Don't you all know that?
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.480]   We're gonna protect ourselves this way
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   um
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.480]   a
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.640]   New theory. I have been told many times not to play this sound so I will stop
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:30.400]   There uh, but if you've been watching our shows, I like to play this sound over and over
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:36.240]   It is a moaning sound coming from the pa system of american airline 1631
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.120]   apparently though many other planes have
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   both Boeing 737 800s and air buses
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.640]   Have had this weird human voice coming from the pa system. It went on all through the flight
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.440]   flight attendants
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.080]   Came on saying we know we hear it. We can't get rid of it
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.520]   The copter comes on saying as far as I can tell it's not a threat. So we're going to continue the flight
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.240]   when it landed
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.720]   american airlines inspected the
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.960]   plane and determined the sounds were caused by an issue
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.280]   With the pa amplifier there was no external access to the system in other words
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.880]   We weren't hacked if I played this for you and I won't because it makes everybody crazy. I haven't heard it
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.200]   Oh, all right. I'll play it for you
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.880]   I was gonna buy my own here. I'll only play. I'll only play a little bit
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.640]   Uh of it
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.800]   Maybe okay. Let me see if I can find it
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.800]   I saw the ad but I never not add I saw the headline but never pointed it
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.280]   Yeah, because we we talked about it uh on the show
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.640]   Uh, and I actually played it for steve gipson
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.720]   Um
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:48.560]   And uh, he said there's no way. I said look you're an you're an expert
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.880]   I said to steve on
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:56.080]   Um, because he's done this kind of thing voice synthesis as things like that. I said you're an expert on this
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:02.880]   Is there any way american airlines could be right that this is caused by a malfunction in the amplifier?
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.800]   He said no
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.120]   They don't make human sounds like that but
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:10.960]   I
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.720]   Think we found the answer
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.760]   I'm first going to play this sound for you because you'll have the same reaction steve had that I had
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.520]   That everybody I played it for has let me see if I can find it
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.800]   Here's emmerson colons original tweet. Okay. I'm sorry everybody
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.880]   Uh, but I have to play it for jeff because he because jeff and aunt haven't heard it
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.520]   This is on the airplane. Can you turn on my uh sound? Oh wait, I turned it off here
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   because
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   Oh turn it down. Let me do it
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:55.120]   Wow, so this goes on through the whole flight
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.920]   That's so bad
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.920]   Keep it going along was the flight
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.400]   Several hours
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.280]   The flight at 10 is in it come on in a second
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:09.920]   Gentlemen, we realize there is an extremely irritating sound coming over the public announcement
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.440]   The flight deck is trying to troubleshoot trying to turn it off. So please in patient with us
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.360]   We know this is a very odd anomaly and none of us are enjoying it
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.080]   So we do appreciate your attention just for a few more moments. It went on the whole time
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.720]   So horrible isn't that oh
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.680]   It sounds like some credits
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.360]   And there's all sorts of theories about
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.040]   It has to be a hack right has to be a human
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.960]   uh, nobody believes uh american airlines
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.080]   When they say no we investigated there's nothing or nothing wrong with it. Well
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.040]   Uh, a v
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.800]   Is this normal sound?
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.840]   Well, I mean there's there's no there's no, I'm sorry. No hacker has gotten in there's something clear. Oh, it's hard
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:01.040]   But there's no hacker. Uh, so a website av geekery.com reached out
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.800]   To american airlines. They said it's a hardwired system. There's no hacking
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.920]   The pa systems on board aircraft are hardwired. There's no external access. No Wi-Fi. No way anybody
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.640]   Could, uh, hack it
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.360]   Uh, there were some theories about this
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.840]   um
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.680]   But I think
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.680]   the answer is
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.560]   drumroll, please
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.640]   there is
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.280]   uh on these devices a a uh, uh, ai
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.480]   Here we go
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.280]   designed to filter out
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.080]   human voices. It's his noise reduction system
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.720]   Okay, and the noise reduction system is specially crafted to
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.840]   filter out human voices
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.600]   And the theory that somebody came up with I think is av geekery, but the theory somebody came up with is ah
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:03.040]   That's what happened a malfunctioning the amplifier and instead of filtering out human voices it filter out everything, but
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.520]   human-like sounds
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.680]   So you're getting a high pass
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:16.560]   Exactly. So precisely high pass and not low cut. So instead you got human sounding noise from from just the
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.840]   noise
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:24.960]   Speech in the plane or from the back from the plain sound even so so the I guess there's a noise
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.680]   I actually thought I had the article and it's not but there's a noise reduction system
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.600]   You weren't even gonna bring this up and then I made you no it's a good story. It's a good story
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   Especially since it's a AI
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.920]   See
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.920]   Has a gravity or another planes
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:49.440]   um, I honestly uh, when I read this and I wish I could find the guy who figured this out when I read the um
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.160]   the uh explanation and went I mean oh that must be what it is a device that's designed
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:01.680]   To reduce the sounds of human voices background talk while the attendant is speaking to you
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.640]   All right, and if it if instead of cutting it it did cut the opposite which I think you could probably electrically things could be flipped
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.800]   flip it around. Yeah
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   That so it filtered out
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.440]   It filtered out all but the human frequencies from the background noise that what's weird is
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.600]   Isn't the normal setting for a PA system off?
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.360]   And it's only when somebody hits the button right that it comes on that was it. So the system was
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.000]   Going on too. Yeah
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.960]   Anyway, oh right. I see you just saying you needed something to even trigger it. Oh, yeah, that's done by hand
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.960]   Okay, but this is just it was all right. It's on okay. It has a mind of its own now a voice of its own
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.480]   Yeah, that's what the computer that's what AI sounds like
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.560]   It sounds miserable. It sounds unhappy
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.240]   Uh
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.240]   This is from the uh
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.480]   Had been flying free at least two more time
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:06.640]   Um, there were a lot of theories on reddit one that it was a medical intercom, but that's not it
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.280]   um
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.520]   the uh
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.040]   Actually, there's been kind of a
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.200]   you know mystery that a lot of people have jumped on
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.800]   And then more people reported. Are we heard something just like that on another flight?
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.320]   Um
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.280]   Andy bio replying to kasey newton south west has been inflicting
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.520]   Psychological audio torture on unwilling passengers since 2015
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.160]   But i don't think it's
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.880]   If you don't like it don't worry. It'll be over in about three minutes
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.080]   Some band gavin de groi playing
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.240]   over the pa system. I don't think that's I don't think that's what's going on
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.800]   Um
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.120]   You see there was this woman who was who was the thing used to be preaching on the plane. Yeah
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.160]   I asked you. Oh, I'm sure, you know
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   People grab that stuff and do all sorts of stuff
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.240]   um
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240]   It's the pa amp
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.720]   I think Andy ended up having the final explanation. Anyway, it's something people have really
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.840]   Clommed on to
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.400]   Maybe maybe by next week we'll know for sure
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.280]   But that's by that's the best theory I have heard so far
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.240]   Is it's a noise reduction system gone wild
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:27.200]   So we talked last week about figma about adobe spending 20 billion dollars
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:34.640]   Uh to acquire figma turns out there is a open source competitor out of spain called pen pot
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.520]   Are you familiar with that? Uh, pen pot. No, I am not
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:41.440]   Pen pot as soon as figma got the announcement
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.400]   Got purchased by adobe. Of course, that's going to take a while to complete
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.920]   Saw it's signups jump by 5600
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.200]   And as a result, they've been able to raise eight million dollars in venture capital
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.040]   Uh
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:00.560]   Because people say well if it's worth 20 billion to adobe maybe uh, maybe this will be worth a little something
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.840]   So if you've been if you're among the many people who say figma users who say i'll never
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   pay for it from adobe
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.200]   Take a look at pen pot open source
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.800]   That's an escalation beat. That's exactly how it should is that you have alternatives. Yes that people can do and um
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:25.600]   God bless adobe do ever kid god bless figma's founder make some money, but hey, here's another part another way to do the same
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.680]   Shame job. That's great
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.720]   Speaking of heard of the what is it ink space ink space the other open source? Yeah
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.080]   Yeah on design
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:41.600]   And graphics but this looks more like ui as well as graphics. Yeah, so ink
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:46.400]   Incscape is uh, it's like illustrator basically. It's an illustrator clone
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.440]   But pen pot is so the whole thing about figmas is collaboration, right?
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.440]   So pen pot is also team focused
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:00.160]   Um, it's free. It's open source. That's cool. Does pretty much
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:06.640]   The same thing i'm sure won't have quite the polish of figma, but maybe who knows? I think there's great open source stuff out there
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:07.680]   Yeah
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:11.440]   And I do know douglas rushkoff is also a supporter of open source
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:17.360]   It is that's exactly the right answer if you don't if you don't like it make one of your own
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.960]   That's why you all learn how to program. Okay
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:27.520]   This is what uh, this is why I have hopes for for dark sky because it's blue sky blue sky
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.480]   The federated story i've heard of um, uh, blue sky because
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.280]   Protocols protocols ban right?
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:41.760]   Uh really interesting story in vanity fair about uh darth vader's voice
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:50.480]   Yeah, you do you read this uh to ant? I think it's really great. It was it was one of those bitter sweet things to see in here about
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.960]   um, you know being
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.960]   Than a star wars, but
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.160]   Here we have ai in place and this ai does a really good job
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.640]   Poor jia show for a jeff
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:07.920]   It's gonna be more ai all the time. That's the future. It does a really good job though
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:13.840]   It's not it's not bad and it's gotten his his um approval because you can say seal of approval
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:21.600]   Yeah, you know and and and i'm glad it has gotten his seal of approval because now the hardcore fan boys and fan girls out there
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:28.240]   Cannot get out there and bitching mauling online about him not being the voice in the future episodes and yadda yadda
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.520]   Look, this man signed off on it. He'd like to retire and he's giving all the rights so on and so forth
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:38.560]   It's a nice happy ending in my opinion. So james zerill jones the voice of darth vader
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.200]   uh, you know
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:48.320]   I do not the breath of darth vader. Yeah, I find your lack of faith to stir
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:57.040]   Um is 91 now it doesn't sound as much. I think I could do the job, but instead that would be nice
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:03.520]   With the Scottish accent, but no a font your lock of faith disturbing
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:10.160]   Oh, the Scottish Darth vader Scottish twin. That's that's not bad. The force is strong in this one
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:15.600]   It's a new darth vader
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.000]   Now you can first
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.280]   But this is the fascinating story the company that's doing it is Ukraine is in the Ukraine
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.840]   Yeah, darth war times
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.200]   Respeacher. This is the uh lead from vanity fair bogged on balayev was working from home
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:36.480]   When the air raid sirens went off they hadn't been heard in the city of leviv since world war two
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.680]   But it was february 24th and russia had just invaded Ukraine
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.800]   When we heard that missiles were attacking and that our internet connection was dropping from parts of our country
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:53.120]   We got into shelter says bill yive that meant he his wife and their dog and two cats
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:34:00.080]   And up huddling in the center of their building. It's a shelter in quotes because it was actually our bathroom. He says
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.840]   There's a role in multiple walls, right? This is this is so sad. There's a rule of two walls
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:11.040]   You need to behind two walls first wall is taking impact second one is stopping small shrapnel
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.240]   But for balayev the work carried on because he needed two people on the other side of the world
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.360]   We're relying on him and the project was the culmination of a passion he'd had since childhood star wars
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:24.000]   He's a 29 year old synthetic speech
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.920]   Artist and they were working on the voice
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:34.080]   They had already done the voice of young luke skywalker for the book of bobba fett and the recent obi one can obi series
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.880]   Now they needed to make darth vader's voice
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.560]   Uh as it was 45 years ago
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.200]   Uh hell of an undertaking right? Yeah
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:48.080]   But I think I bet you they've done it. I mean I think this is something that that can be done pretty well
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.840]   in the past
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.280]   You know when uh would would either woodpecker retired
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.720]   They'd get a new woody
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.040]   So uh, like I said, believe it was never the same, you know, it was two darons
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.280]   On bewitched the second daren was never the same as the old daren
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.480]   I know the voice of today's porcupig and I swear to god he could be melblanc
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.600]   He's really good. He came in actually in the studio and tried to teach me how to do it
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.600]   Um, the very nice guy young guy, uh auditioned he had he the story is great
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.440]   Was it a triangulation? I think it was he called melblanc as a kid
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.720]   He looked up melblanc in the phone book and called him standing
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.040]   And he calls in his wife answers and he says, um, can I talk to mel
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:38.080]   And he talks to him and melblanc becomes a mentor for this like he was 12
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.360]   That's awesome
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.240]   And eventually he takes over and does the voice of porcupig the pig
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.080]   So, you know, it's not unusual that voice artists
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.640]   We miss without phone books
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.720]   You see all those privacy stuff
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.120]   Yeah, that's because of the call up melblanc
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.600]   Exactly exactly and
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.760]   Uh, anyway, I get arrested for it
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.200]   Uh, let me see if I can uh, oh bob burgen. That was his name great is his name. Not was
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.600]   Uh, great guy the voice of uh, porcupig. This was a triangulation
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.000]   episode 22. So I just
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]   referred with the
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   Talk. Yeah, so he taught me how to
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.920]   The scene where he's having a crime fit banging on the door talk like porcupig the pig
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.480]   He kind of sounds like porcupig the pig
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.240]   Mom, would you please open the door?
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:26.160]   Mom, god damn it blankety blankety yackety act so I come in on blankety blank
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.080]   But I have to be you don't even get the first few say I did first job. I ever had good man. He was there
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.480]   Yeah, so it's four hours of that. You know, anyway great guy bob burgen
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.880]   Uh triangulation 23. I miss doing triangulation. That's where we're bringing some
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:47.760]   People in time. Yeah, it's so much fun to meet all these people. Yeah, anyway, great story highly recommended
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.800]   Uh
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.320]   James Earl Jones
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.240]   As you said gave his seal of approval. It's okay if you use my voice. I hope they gave now
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.880]   Will be used in the movie is it gonna substitute you don't need James Earl Jones any more?
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.400]   No, that's correct
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.360]   He the term was he licensed it. Yeah, so you need an actor
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.360]   You need somebody anybody to say the lines and then they apply the synthesis on top of it
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.080]   To make it sound like James Earl Jones
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.920]   So everybody's having free the washington post, you know now
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.520]   Hey, all they can make pictures as fast as it can be and that's neat and that's danger
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.760]   It's not dangerous wonderful
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.160]   I agree. I agree, but it's all the all the moral panic there. Give me some time there
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.520]   Um didn't have it ready. Oh, sorry
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.200]   Yeah, you know, I gotta be on the trigger all the time with me aunt, you know, you never know
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.840]   Oh
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.680]   Right and it's always you can always use it for bad and good and and the fact that you can get all these neat pictures now
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:52.800]   And everybody can get dolly. This is cool. The fact that James Earl Jones can live on the movie. This is cool
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.760]   Okay, we should mention that apparently the dolly waiting list is now eliminated and anybody can sign up
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.240]   Although I see still here. It's just sergeant rejoices. Yeah
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.400]   dolly too, which
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.240]   I don't know if it's the best of the artificial intelligence artists
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.240]   I have to say stable diffusion kind of the og is the og for sure this one from open ai
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.200]   Stable diffusion is uh, it's pretty. I tried and tried and tried to get it
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.440]   And it's competitors to give me a cover for guttenberg parenthesis. Oh and
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.760]   Um, and nothing will work out. I wouldn't understand parenthesis. It wouldn't understand guttenberg
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.880]   So I just got four actual designs for the cover by the way nice and your audience can
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:38.160]   Should we look at them? Yeah, why don't you if you don't is this uh
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.840]   Here it is
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.840]   Pick the cover it's in a tweet
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:47.360]   Because jeff doesn't do anything that's not in a tweet. All right. Here's cover number one the guttenberg parenthesis
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   Oh, I like it some lead type for the yeah, so for for the folks on audio
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:56.880]   It's kind of a parchment looking background and then two pieces of lead type. They're actually
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.400]   A braces not parenthesis, but we'll we'll go with oh
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.720]   Yeah, you're gonna have some problems with that one. Yeah. Well, it's so I think it can be changed
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.880]   The uh, so that's cover one. Yeah, the literal net may not like that one. Okay. I may not oh again with the braces
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:17.680]   No more braces that kind of but just kind of just a title braces top above and then and then the subtitle below and above
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.680]   box, you know white cover
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.600]   I think kind of nice and then it kind of makes the box at the bottom
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:30.320]   Uh has a has a cursor pointed at it. So it's the old cursor trick. Finally we get some parentheses in here
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:37.120]   Then you have big parenthesis very modern. This is much more modern. Look. Uh, very senseerif font
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:44.640]   And then number four you have two parenthesis one filled with old type one with modern programming
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.040]   And everything's a kimbo there saying the Gutenberg parenthesis and everything else in between
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.640]   It's kind of like the trash masher on star wars. They're in there about to get squished
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.360]   So uh, that's good some some good choices which one which one would you go with?
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.880]   Hmm each of you
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:11.280]   I think I like this uh the modern one myself, but which one the three this one? Yeah, but I have to say
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.800]   I kind of like the old fashioned feeling of this, but I'm afraid it won't sell any books. Yeah that one now
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.000]   Pretty is probably you got the eye you got the eye out pro. What do you think?
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.600]   I'm more with that one through right? Of course remember. I'm the guy who chose the twig twig
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:30.080]   album art
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.720]   So maybe you shouldn't listen to me
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.640]   I like it the twig. I like it. I like it. I like it
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.920]   This kind of what we did by the way, they'd give us I think eight choices and then we'd go through them and
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.720]   Eight or nine choices stand a procedure. Where so where did you go to get these designers? Did bloomsbury?
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.400]   Bloomsbury the publisher did they give me about 10 these all right. I got an assignment for our audience
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.400]   Midjourney stable diffusion dolly to whatever you want
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.320]   Let's see some submissions for your ideas
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.440]   Artificially generated for the Gutenberg
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.400]   Sure because I know jeff doesn't know how to write a prompt. We got to get somebody's really I don't either
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.080]   Isn't it amazing how writing has become as become it's a new programming. I've said this before it is
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.000]   Programming doesn't have to be you know the code that you see
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.480]   It's whatever it takes to get a computer to do what you want
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:25.600]   And when you're dealing with an AI you need to speak its language and that's all and the people are very good at it
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:32.400]   I bet you will get some good ones. I do. Yeah, I can't wait for this on twitter. I like it. Yeah stuff. Yeah. Yeah
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.520]   tweet tweet at jet jar jet jar with jeff jar with at jeff jar with
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:47.440]   That's oh, I haven't even gotten to your section yet jeff jar with
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.920]   Well, we do have some true events. You have some of this. We have the amazon event and the google search event
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.160]   I think we got it. Yeah, it was a little annoying that google did a search event the same day as amazon did it's
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.120]   hardware event
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.720]   Stacey really needs to weigh in on these we'll let her
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:08.480]   Next week. She's not here, but next week. I'm sure she'll have quite a bit to say she's usually invited to these
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:14.240]   These are by the way. They don't do them live. You have to be invited a lot of the press isn't and gadget did get invited
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:21.280]   So i'm going to be reading off of the engagit live blog of the things amazon announced this morning 9am pacific
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.080]   with their annual fall
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.320]   showcase
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.560]   Let's see what any easier list leo. Yeah, you have one down at line
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.320]   58 because axios makes everything short. Oh god axios got purchased by the way
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.600]   And uh, there's a hysterical
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.920]   Atlantic piece
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.920]   Have you read this yet
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.640]   on axios and the axios style
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.520]   axios, uh, has
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.040]   You know what it book out pushing the smart brevity
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.520]   Yeah, and one of the funniest things is that even though axios sold
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.840]   Uh, who bought them? I can't remember some cocks cocks bought them
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.560]   They did not sell the intellectual property rights to their style
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:20.560]   So they have kept the property rights to this bulleted style and it's thought that perhaps their plan is to sell this to enterprises
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.480]   Yeah, that is that's probably the idea that though they have they basically they have a book out on how to do smart
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.000]   brevity and they're trying to argue to companies that this should become your new communication standard
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.360]   So the story from the Atlantic is about axios
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.960]   telling every employee to buy six copies
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.440]   in a
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:47.120]   They well they can they can make expensive and a highly unethical attempt to get to the top of the New York times
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:54.960]   Just like bliss non junior, but then the Atlantic had the good idea of let's do it in the smart brevity axios bullet style
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:01.760]   The men who summarized the news at the bullet point loving startup axios mike alan Roy Schwartz and jim van de high may now be driving it
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.320]   They have tried to tamper with their books position on the new york times bestseller list
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:14.320]   And then the rest of it he has even little special bullet points. There's a why it matters why it matters and then a but
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.440]   and a but but
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.560]   The numbers driving the news but but but but but but
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.080]   And this is the thing I thought was juicy
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.240]   The core technology was not included in the sale of the cocks it was spun off as a separate b2b company dug
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.760]   Axios hq they're gonna do a series a round this time. This is the greed
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.080]   Douglas Rushkopf was talking about
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.880]   Is how can I make as much money as possible?
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.680]   out of this
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:52.960]   Anyway a very funny parody robinson mire both delivering the news and parading axiosist style
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:59.120]   So let me go and get the axios bullet point list online 58
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.560]   This will be a lot easier to first
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.440]   Oh, why it matters
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.880]   You got it. Okay, why it matters. This is the most significant update to amazon's kin so they have a new kindle scribe
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.480]   The kindle scribe is a big deal. I think it's finally now has a stylus. It's the remarkable
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.840]   This is identical to the remarkable two which I love and have
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.080]   I'm cheaper. Oh is it 340?
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.760]   Versus what is it 1000 for the remarkable? No, no, no, it wasn't that
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:28.800]   expensive
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:36.000]   No, well, I think it's more like 600. Let me see. Let's just go see I still have my remarkable and uh, and I do like it
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]   Use it regularly no
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.040]   279 my friend. It's less expensive not more
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.880]   What?
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.400]   Oh, okay
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.120]   I think you probably mark or not included but still
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.280]   Yes, still wrong. I'm not thousands of dollars. No
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.120]   I thought it was more. Yeah, um, so anyway these kindle scribe
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.160]   340 including a stylus 10.2 inch display
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.760]   Yeah, the remark you know what I use the remark before and I will use it every December
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.480]   I use it to do sketches for my coding
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:10.240]   My coding competition because a lot of times I need to sketch stuff out before I start writing code
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:16.240]   So it's useful for that, but I'm not a handwritten note taker as I'm not my handwriting is a god awful
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.560]   That's why that's why I was I my parents forced me to take typing
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:26.000]   Before I went into the seventh grade because she said they said you're everybody's every teacher's gonna. I think you're an idiot
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.960]   Yeah typing worked
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.960]   in fact that was very uh
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:38.560]   Perspicacious of them. Oh, it probably led me to journalism. I can type first. Okay. Did you take typing class? No
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.280]   Yale. No, yales far. We don't have typing. We have writing people
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   Who
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.760]   Uh
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.960]   Remarkable says it sold a million devices. So it's clearly a market that amazon wants to get into it was a lot of being
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:57.760]   $139 halo rise a nightstand device that has a little glowing halo
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.120]   It contracts sleep
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.920]   Without you wearing sensors or without putting a camera in your room as you know the google nest will do that
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.640]   Also, but using the camera and this and the microphone
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.440]   The biggest story if you ask me
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.200]   They've got new echo dot and echo studio speakers new better audio and all that but
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:22.480]   Amazon as you know bought euro the mesh router system and the new echo dot devices are euro extenders. Yeah
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.040]   That finally makes sense. Isn't that brilliant?
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.520]   Isn't that freaking brilliant
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:33.680]   Because I mean it's a win win amazon wins because you're gonna have more amazon microphones and cameras in your house
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.360]   Right you win because you're gonna have basically a subset euro is extenders
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:44.000]   That you're gonna have a mesh net subsidized. Yeah, there's a kid i'll be eager to hear here stacey on that next week
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   Yeah, I think that's a good move
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.760]   And as long as they work as well as the euro euro zone beacons, which is their extenders then uh, oh, that's great
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.320]   there's a new kid friendly echo dot
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.160]   with uh
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.280]   Let's uh children collaborate with elects at the right stories
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.760]   Uh, let me guess with a eye with a eye
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.920]   No
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:13.360]   Bmw is going to use uh amazon's echo in its uh next generation car in car voice assistant
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.880]   No, no, although if you've heard
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.240]   The voice assistants at least I know from ford
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.120]   That they offer they're so poor compared to the ones that even apple offers and uh an amazon and google
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.520]   I would I would rather have a voice assistant coming from a company that really has my choice
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:34.800]   And may I ask you what kind of car do you have?
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.360]   I haven't christmas 300, but it's not a new one. So I always think all this fancy
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.720]   I always think a mafia dawn is arriving at work when I see it
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:54.320]   It's black. It's dark. It's scary. I just feel like oh my god here comes tony soprano. Yep get out of the way
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.280]   No
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.320]   Now you know you can get radar in there to prove that he doesn't have anybody in the trunk
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.280]   Oh, that's kind of yeah, that's a who's doing that. That's a cool idea. Where was it? You had that stroke?
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.040]   I know I will get to it. I guess it's not
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.040]   Volvo
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.560]   My tweet on this is this is why why you never see sopranos driving Volvo
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.160]   In car, but there's a good reason for it because people leave pets and kids behind
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.240]   And don't know it most cars now have a uh sensor in the backseat
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.480]   That will say you left something in the backseat to avoid that
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.880]   But this is cool because it will actually if it senses a human or a dog in the backseat
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.960]   Or in the car it'll turn on the uh ac and keep it cool. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:36.720]   So anyway, I know I went I went out of the sick of the
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:42.480]   Euro home networks will gain the ability to set a backup internet connection method like a cellular connection
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.040]   If there's a broadband outage, that's a really great fallback
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.560]   Solution it's a software update for existing heroes as long as you have the euro pro subscription
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.920]   Oh, so wait a second wait wait wait wait so I use my it takes the wifi off my phone and then makes that house wide
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.640]   Yeah, okay got it got it
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:07.680]   Amazon's new $35 Alexa voice remote pro coming in November. Let's use the voice assistant to find the remote
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.640]   That's lost
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.160]   Okay, first you have to buy a remote
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:20.160]   And then you have to lose it if you lose the remote well, we've got a new remote finding remote
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.960]   For only $35
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.040]   You have the tag for your tag for the tag
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.880]   And
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.840]   They're only doing this because they know people are going to fall for it
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.920]   Well, I guess it's maybe it's in the remote itself has happened to us
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.120]   I guess it's a set it is a remote itself that will answer when you talk to it. I guess
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.880]   If you're in the vicinity and it can hear you
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.880]   If the chihuahua ate it, I don't know if you can talk
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.960]   While an updated $140 fire tv cube by the fire tv cube is actually pretty good
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:02.400]   offers more input options that will be available next month company also announced a new high-end tv line branded with fire tv
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:10.000]   Starting at $800 remember the hands up before they have a TV before you did another update. It's cheap. Yeah. Oh, I see it's so high
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.520]   This is a little higher end
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.360]   Uh, remember the astro robot didn't do anything except it would go up and down
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.560]   Uh people they getting some updates. Yeah
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:23.280]   Uh, it's going to have the ability to learn which doors and windows should be open or shut
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.480]   So if you leave one open and leave the house it could scream like a curl. I don't
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:34.640]   Say what it's going to do, but that's the point is you left the door open
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.960]   Hey, hey
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.600]   Neck up
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.120]   Hey
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.640]   So it's going to go is it it's going to go?
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.480]   Wandering around the house mumbling to itself
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.520]   Humans left the window open. I always have to check
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:58.800]   Get there figure out to close the window the rolling robot will also be able to detect pets and capture a short video of the dad dog or cat in action
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:05.040]   Trying to eat it probably a software development kit cost
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.560]   Oh, it was expensive wasn't it? It was a thousand. I don't know you can't even get it right because you had to get it
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.800]   It's one of those, you know, I was a day one stuff one. No, I was just he had 999 bucks. Yep
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:24.960]   Requested a day one you have to ask you have to you have to request an invitation to spend a thousand dollars on this useless robot
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:32.320]   It's one of those day one editions wonder if there's any new day one editions actually come to think of it
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:35.200]   I don't know you can't
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.200]   Okay. Oh, here we go day one editions
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.280]   Invite only request an invite now still got the drone camera. Nobody wants and the astro
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:51.600]   I did get and I actually we use it the sticky note printer the print sticky notes from your amazon echo device
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:55.680]   That was a day one that I bid on and got and you use it
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.680]   Yeah
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.440]   Because printed things on the refrigerator is that what it is you could do it for that what I
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:05.920]   Thought we would do is tell it add something to our grocery list
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.160]   And then at the end of the week say print my grocery list and take it to the store because it's got a little checkboxes
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.640]   And the whole thing you can do
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:19.520]   Yeah, at least ended up just you know, we've always had this pad and she keeps writing on that. I'll say honey
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:23.280]   I'm gonna tell the echo the pragmatic person, huh?
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:26.400]   So there's always like two items on it
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:33.440]   By cheese for a new and you know, I mean it's dumb. It's dumb. Nobody else puts anything on it but me
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:42.480]   Amazon says it's shaping most of its device work around the concept of and you'll love this jeff
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.440]   ambient intelligence
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.520]   He's not really bright. He's got ambient intelligence
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:57.120]   He's not the smartest guy in the world. He's got ambient intelligence
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:05.520]   I don't even know. Oh, there's intelligence in the fabric of the mesh of the universe. Well, it means that it surveils you so it already knows what you want
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.640]   Amazon's hardware chief dave limp
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:15.440]   That's his name. Oh no the poor man was was born with that name dave limp
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:21.360]   Uh, contrast it Amazon's focus with that of other companies that are focused on virtual reality
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.000]   Limp said technology needs to be personalized
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.560]   And intuitive enough to adapt to you and your environment that the other way around
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.680]   Limp said we call this ambient intelligence
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.760]   Was that limping up for you?
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.760]   That was droopy
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.720]   Oh, I was drooping not limping. Oh
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.440]   Anyway
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.960]   Technology needs to be personalized and intuitive enough to adapt to you and your environment actually that's
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.880]   Now that I think of that droopy dog is really just a parody
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.680]   of

[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.760]   Google is trying to reinvent search

[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.400]   And land the 10 biggest announcements from google search on 22
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:53.600]   Is that today the 22? No, what does that mean?
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:57.360]   Search on oh
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:02.080]   They are they talking about
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:05.520]   Number one
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:10.480]   Multi search expanding they're gonna expand what's multi search jeff
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:17.440]   Oh shoot. I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that I forget search by image and text at the same time. That's right. You could you could yeah, that's right
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:24.240]   That's right. They're expanding that to 70 new languages. Uh, they launched it last year for english and us based queries
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.000]   Oh, this is this is the one where you can use your camera's phone
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.640]   Yeah, it's kind of like google lens
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.240]   And then it will give you both text and image like if you do a stop sign or something the general argument here
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:39.920]   Is the search becomes more visual and the tick-tock once again?
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.760]   I scared everybody to show in the way and I there was a story of the rundown two weeks ago
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.760]   We didn't talk about it. That was fine
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.200]   Um about how the kids today are using tick-tock for search and and I tried it and actually it's not that bad
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.320]   And so I thought oh let me try it and I tried it. I just went for restaurants and it actually wasn't that bad
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.040]   Well, no, okay. I'm just playing. I I've been reading this and I don't get it. So let me go to tick-tock
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.040]   The easiest thing to look for restaurants
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:10.400]   Right there on tick-tock restaurants near me on tick-tock and what you'll find is I can't I'm mesmerized by a young lady in her bikini

[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.040]   Isn't that funny?

[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.200]   That's why you have to give it the location give it the town now
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:56.640]   For giving petaluma

[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:14.240]   Yeah, okay. That's a good one. That's a start. Mm
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:20.080]   Here are five sonoma restaurants. Well, that's close. You know, that's the same county anyway
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.680]   Uh
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.560]   Spain
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:25.360]   Yeah, this is good. I wouldn't say it's better than google
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:28.960]   No, no, but it's I thought it couldn't possibly do anything
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.200]   Yeah, this looks good
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:38.400]   Oh, so nice shrimp scampi from cafe rusica where we got our pizza. Okay moving along item two multi search expanding multi search
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.960]   near me coming soon
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:43.360]   Oh see
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.040]   Yeah
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.120]   Zooming on image and text crazy by looking for products or anything via your camera
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.880]   But you can then qualify to say I only want local results
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:57.280]   So I could take a picture of shrimp scampi and say where can I get that near here?
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.440]   I'm near me. That's nice. I like that
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.320]   Google lens translated text is now clearer
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:09.280]   Well, I'll be the judge of that. Okay. Well, yeah, so they're putting a background behind it
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:11.440]   So that you can read it a little bit better
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:13.600]   Google that's before the
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:19.200]   After as per taking the background out after starting to read great
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:22.480]   Google iOS app shortcuts today the google
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:26.800]   I liked the before you did too. Yeah. Oh well
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.360]   We were being generous thinking that before was the better. No, I just went to the one I could read
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.960]   Google iOS app shortcuts today the google search app for iOS will add shortcuts
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.080]   To make it easier for searchers to search translate
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:42.160]   Oh, you know
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.000]   That's a nice way of saying
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.480]   Instead of giving you search results. We're going to give you things that we think you want
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.200]   This is more that you know knowledge graph thing where
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.600]   Yeah, I you know, I I think this is the problem with google is
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.680]   there
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.440]   And I understand what they're saying is we want to give you what you want not search results
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.280]   What you don't you don't really want search results
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:08.240]   You want them qualified in a way that makes it more useful for you and we'll decide how those are qualified
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.560]   And I sure I agree with that
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.840]   New search was not refinements. Google's are rolling out new search refinements and aids for you when you search in auto complete
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.800]   Uh now as you type your query google will present tapable words
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:29.280]   To build your query on the fly if you type f o it's going to say food fox ford ford ford night forever football
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:36.480]   And then offer you fox nude food near me food forever 21 footlocker and ford not at all useful
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.960]   you
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:41.360]   Okay, auto crazy start with f o
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.800]   Things to start with foe
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:49.520]   That's what that was wasn't it, but I guess if you went to a third letter it would be better, right?
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.920]   Uh
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:57.760]   Google will allow you to refine your query after you search by letting you add or remove topics you want to zoom in or out of
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.040]   So this is basically a new way to you know a new search ui or better improve search ui
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:11.200]   Uh more visual information google's showing for some queries a more visually designed knowledge graph approach to the search results
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:16.240]   That so instead again when you search for wahaka instead of getting the search results
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:21.440]   You're going to get the wiki pd you're going to get a flight. You're going to get a map. You're going to get weather
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:29.840]   Uh restaurant named wahaka near you and restaurant near you named wahaka explore as you scroll as you scroll through the results
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:33.920]   Sometimes the more you scroll the less for is irrelevant the results get yeah
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:40.320]   Yeah, google now has a new explore feature to give searchers inspiration around their query
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:45.680]   But not something that exactly matches their query you getting a you getting the theme here
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:49.280]   You don't really want what you searched for we
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.360]   Well, it goes back to it goes back to your do we all have to be good at writing
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:02.720]   Props queries. Yeah queries and prompts. Yeah google search today may show a section for discussions and forums for us english results
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:09.840]   So this is a response to people using reddit instead of google to search for stuff. It will in fact now
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:16.000]   Give you a section called discussions and forums that includes reddit quora and edmunds in this example
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.920]   translated local and international news
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:23.840]   Translated so this i want to actually tout
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:30.240]   Uh, are you on chrome? No, you're probably not. No, i'm on firefox. Oh, no, no, and i'll tell you why i'm not probably
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.240]   Translated ready. Yeah
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:35.520]   Um
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.320]   Go to google translate
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:43.280]   Translate dot google dot com
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.040]   Yeah
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.560]   And uh, put in the site hs.fi you wanted to translate that site
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:56.480]   So i can do a website hs dot f i so that's a finish
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:04.560]   Site exactly it's a finish news has a sinky sound mat now i have a signal for the mat i could select translation
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:10.080]   Original or trust to come back to the original and of course it will be absolutely there's no you can't pick a word out
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.840]   Yeah, but the translation news in russian reread the latest good time into the scroll down
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:23.840]   It's a very good newspaper and i now go to it every day because of google translate that's kind of cool
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:27.600]   It really actually and this finish one is important because of the uh
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:31.760]   The explosion war or to pipe or the door pipeline, right?
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:38.320]   They make the wonderful president they have yeah, um, and the fabulous 3d printed meat
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:47.040]   Stoodler restaurant critic tested the taste tested the taste wait a minute. Why is this all blank down here?
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:50.720]   What's going on says information is not yet been retrieved? Oh, okay?
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.200]   Because you're using something it's true bad browser. It's translating
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:59.600]   a it always works instantly for me. What do you mess up leo? She's
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:05.680]   Do you know what your roof is doing or how your roof is doing in this way moist?
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:08.000]   It does not sneak in that's an ad

[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:21.760]   It's fascinating. Let me see how the news in russian is look at this it's in russian
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:24.400]   Wait a minute like this
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:29.040]   Was it must come as a finished family couple living on the border
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:32.800]   That's good
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.000]   It's really interesting as a figure that it left the syrillic
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.800]   This by the way, well, this is three newspapers. This is the the the dog is die heather
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:47.760]   Politiken until singing in centenmont. They all are together publishing us there are some of their stories in russian
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:54.160]   What is it doing with you? That's so we would you get a real browser? I just stopped on the ground too. I'm in brave
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:58.080]   It's probably all the ad blocking. I have running. Let me turn it off
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:00.320]   Oh
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:05.600]   Yeah, the 52 trackers were on this page 48 percent of the page
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:11.840]   And it connected to nine different domains out of 12. They were
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:19.040]   So most of us loaded for me, but a little bit is not let me refresh. Yeah without the blocker still nothing
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.760]   No, no, it's still not there for me strong. Huh?
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:25.440]   Well, maybe they maybe so many americans are going there right now
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:28.000]   Because they're already the show so popular
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.720]   So it has news, but it also has foliage
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:36.320]   What's foliage
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.720]   Something to translate
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:43.520]   Let's see what's most read here in hell sinky
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:47.360]   Absolutely nothing nothing
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:52.560]   How about hs has sink in sonomot vision
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:57.680]   Oh, is a normal toothbrush inevitably the wrong choice
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:06.160]   There's a new threat lurking in the stock market. It's interesting that for the stock market image. They have the uh, New York stock exchange
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.120]   Well, yeah, because it's that's the one that matters, huh
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:13.280]   Putin's panic solution. They've even got uh,
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:16.160]   Litaration in finish
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:21.520]   If only you had a decent browser, you would see the story i'm looking at right now, which is historical hell sinky come to life
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:28.240]   I actually enjoy hell sinky the train station there is quite quite something it is. It's a wonderful place a wonderful country
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.480]   Yeah, uh and it's a sane country
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:34.400]   So you're saying if I used chrome it would just do it automatically or I guess well
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.560]   Yeah, because then I will then when I do is I just add the google translate into the chrome
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.840]   Oh, I get it on the top and I could just do it and it works beautifully
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.600]   So my point is that I can now read news
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.120]   Finish is a language. I am never gonna learn
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:55.200]   I'm not gonna know how to pick out any word and yet I can now very comfortably read the hell sink in sonomot
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:58.800]   Which is an excellent newspaper because of how good google translate is now
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:04.960]   So any language you want to go into and now they're incorporating that in google news so that you can get local views
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.240]   Uh, you want to find what's going on in next though. You can I would love the newspapers. Yeah, that's pretty amazing
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:16.080]   So you could uh news from mexico maybe out do you search for news from or?
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.040]   I don't know. This is launching. This is launching next year. So we'll have yeah
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:24.240]   Yeah, so it's not there. Yeah, the point is always doing is bringing that translation ability
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.080]   I think that's actually excuse or you more stuff. I think that's I think it's really valuable
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.320]   gigantic um and do you think that's a response to uh,
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.960]   senator clobuchar snippetechs
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:38.960]   No, I haven't thought about that way
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:44.000]   I think it's just uh, the technology's gotten so good. They're just incorporating how long these use this
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.960]   I mean, I the the clobuchar stuff is driving me completely. Yeah, she's made a deal apparently with the ted cruised
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.560]   So that's going ahead this idea of it is truly a ploy fewer than 1500 journalists
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.600]   Google has to carry you
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:05.280]   Which is just and so against the first amendment. It's so against the court. I'm sure court will throw it out
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.800]   Although I know I know well
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.840]   Those lower courts now because because the right wing the right wing is saying is do it a must carry right?
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.240]   Uh, you've got to carry our hate speech. Yeah
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:22.400]   Uh, we're only at 10 of the 22. So let me hustle along. No. No. No, it was 10 things in 2022
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.680]   This is this is frying your brain today. I don't know that it's not the 22nd of the month
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:30.640]   It's not 22 things. It's 20 20
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.640]   It's never 10 in 2022
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:37.520]   About this. This is actually another good one about this result displays personalization
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.320]   So we've always had this about this result next to the searches that explains what's going on
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.840]   It will now show of personalization. I eat tracking
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:52.560]   Has uh been used good. That's more in the results. So I think that's really uh, really great
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.480]   Very nice. Thank you search engine land for breaking this down the biggest updates from google search on
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:01.600]   2022
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.600]   Uh, I'm afraid about a story
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:09.360]   Yeah, sure. So did you read the new york times story about the linkedin ab test test? Yes
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:12.240]   So
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:16.800]   Linked in with academics at mit and somewhere else I think
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:22.800]   Did a large scale test um of of the loose ties?
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:25.520]   Theses
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.440]   And the question is when it comes to getting jobs and getting connections is it better to have
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.400]   Strong ties or loose ties?
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:35.360]   By the way, I think this is the
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.240]   This seems to be uh, I don't know if i'm agreeing with you or disagreeing here
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.760]   But this is a kind of a scatological headline or a
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.440]   That's my point. Yeah, that's your by guy. I hate tailio. We're gonna agree a little moral panic here
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:56.240]   Amen, amen linkedin ran social experiments on 20 million users
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.240]   Well, they did what everybody does they didn't ab test right at scale with
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.160]   academics with
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.080]   Happens all the time. That's the whole views of what it is. This is what we used to do in job search
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:10.160]   We tried something else to see if it worked better than people and it did so now we're gonna give it to everybody
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:16.760]   What's wrong with that? Yeah, and you know the new york times ab tests everything sure so here's the new york times
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:23.360]   Demonizing the knowledge that comes from from the ability to say let's try two things in the market
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:30.080]   And get the feedback loop and then go with a better one for people they do say about five paragraphs in tech giants like linkedin
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:37.920]   The world's largest professional network routinely run large scale experiments in which they track different versions of app features web designs and algorithms
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.560]   Under four people the long-standing practice called ab testing is intended to improve consumers experience and keep them engaged
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:48.640]   Which helps the companies make money through premium membership fees or advertising?
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.600]   Users often have no idea the companies are running the tests on them in parentheses
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.600]   What am I supposed to have that have the cookie thing saying if we're doing tests on in parentheses
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:03.680]   The new york times uses such tests to assess the wording of headlines to make decisions about products and features the company releases
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:13.600]   So that wasn't in the story that was added in. Oh, you think that was added later? Oh, I don't was somebody somebody had their original version and put it up
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.000]   Oh my god
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:23.200]   Well, they didn't even admit they do ab tests as they as they demonize them and and what really bothers me about this
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.400]   The reason I want to have a fit is because we're trying to
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.200]   very much to get these companies to share data and to do
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:40.080]   Test experiments call them what you will with researchers so that we can find out more about what the impact is and improve things for people
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:45.920]   We want them to do more of this and when the new york times does something like this and then probably Amy clobuchar will come and write a
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.640]   You know the law saying you can't do this anymore because it's evil
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:55.600]   Um, then we lose this opportunity to have researchers and companies work together and it pisses me off
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:01.040]   Thank you for my the question the article raises was anybody disadvantaged
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:06.400]   But that's that's that's that's a red herring too because linkedin started off saying well
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:08.320]   This is we think it operates this way
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:13.200]   And so everybody was operating that way they said well, let's just test and see if another way might improve things
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:17.440]   So yeah for the time of the test somebody was ahead and somebody was behind
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.240]   But you don't know until you know, which is good until you do it. Yeah
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.920]   Red herring it's like saying well, we're gonna test vaccines and people who don't get it are disadvantaged
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:33.040]   Well, yeah, but that's the kind of the nature of the test and if the vaccine happened to kill people then the people who didn't get it
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:39.520]   We're not this advantage right so that's why we test so yeah, I think that this is not
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:46.560]   Uh, I think that's a little bit of a scary such water dumb headline. Hey, we're running way behind
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.040]   So let me quickly do our google changelog
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.280]   I know it's too much fun
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.440]   Robin way too much fun
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:04.080]   Couple of quickies here uh chromecast with google tv the hd version is now officially available for 30 dollars
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.880]   Yes, you get your very own color bars
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:10.640]   1080p hdr and 8 gigabyte of storage
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:16.640]   Uh as a user of chromecast with google tv the previous version I highly recommend it. It's really really good
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:18.240]   They did a good job on that
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:23.680]   Uh, sometimes, you know, I don't we talked about fire tv earlier not a fan of fire tv because it's just a big ad for amazon
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.200]   Shows, you know, like lord of the rings takes over the whole thing
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:32.400]   Chromecast is good. They don't really do that. It's it's it's a good interface. I think they did a good job
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:38.240]   You have you have I presume you have the wall so you have you have fire you have chromecast you have apple tv you have roku
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:41.040]   Yep. What's your go to?
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.600]   Usually apple tv i'm sorry to say
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:50.000]   It's the most expensive of them the only one that I have that's equally expensive is an invidious shield
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:56.640]   Which is android tv it's not as good because android tv just does not offer the same range of channels apple tv
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:59.680]   Seems to have the most premium channels
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:05.200]   I think roku if somebody just said well, what should I get roku is so inexpensive less than a hundred bucks
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:12.640]   It's technically probably as good as apple tv or almost as good as apple tv. I think apple tv is a little better because it has a better processor in it
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.320]   Uh, I think it does a better job of 4k hdr and everything
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:24.000]   But I have to say comparing head-to-head the 30-dollar chromecast dongle with apple tv the chromecast dongle at pretty
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.440]   though
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:27.280]   You know what are you? You price is pretty good
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.320]   Believe it or not extreme xbox one
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:36.160]   That's actually fine. That's a good I used to use that all the time and in fact expos one
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:39.920]   Their original landlage are all roku enabled TVs here, right?
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.960]   But um the primary tv is it's got a xbox one on it and I have one of those
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:50.080]   Harmony remotes. They ain't that what they're called and that just runs everything
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:55.920]   Actually, if you liked the old chromecast sad to say that google has now discontinued
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:03.440]   The old chromecast the traditional chromecast software support will continue they really want to go with this google tv version of chromecast
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.480]   They've done this before I was a big fan of chromecast audio do you remember that it was just like a chromecast
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:11.920]   But it only did audio an optical out killed it almost immediately
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:17.360]   Uh, they will continue to support the software. Uh, so you can continue to use it at least for the time being
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.880]   Chrome now lets you search your history and bookmarks from
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:27.520]   The address bar so that's a nice feature. I often open history to go back to a pitch
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:34.560]   They're accidentally closed or whatever you can now at history at bullmarks or at tabs
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:37.440]   Nice feature follow that with a space
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:41.920]   And then that will be a search you bad. You don't use chrome
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:49.840]   Well, I'll tell you why don't ruse chrome it should be in the google change law google has announced that they are moving to manifest three
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:52.560]   Manifest v3
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.400]   It's a story above. Yeah, uh, and I am not a fan of manifest v3 because
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:04.240]   It will not allow my favorite ad blocker, uh gore hills you block origin
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:07.840]   You stop starving the journalists in the country
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:12.480]   Well, I don't care about them, but I do want to starve google
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:20.000]   Uh, so yeah, I mean you can make a case and and steve gibson did yesterday that uh manifest v3
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.680]   Which is part of will be part of all chromium versions by the way going forward
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:31.920]   Uh, is better performing because it doesn't have to pass the content through all the all the extensions you've got and potentially more secure
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.160]   At least more privacy protection because but I install what extensions I want
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:40.640]   I know what extensions I have on there if somebody wants to install honey and let honey see everywhere
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:45.680]   They're going in order to get those honey, uh, you know coupons like my wife
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:53.520]   They should be allowed to that I don't think it's up to google to say no in any event manifest v3 will block that api that is used
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:59.360]   By a lot of ad blockers and other tools. Uh, it will improve performance in theory improve security
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.200]   um
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.760]   Firefox continues to support manifest v2
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:09.600]   Some browsers that are based on chromium like vivaldi say they will continue to support v2
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.760]   Uh brave has its own way of doing things some brave probably won't be affected, but at but microsoft's edge
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:18.320]   Which is right now the number two browser
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:23.760]   Uh will in fact follow google's lead because both microsoft and google are ad companies
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:28.080]   When they call it a content blocker what they really it's just it's not it's an ad blocker
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:32.400]   It's an ad blocker, uh, but it can add block other kinds of content for instance
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:36.000]   I use you block origin to block that annoying cookie banner
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:41.120]   That's a good kind of content you could use it to block, uh, uh, bikini shots
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:47.840]   I don't think there is a filter on the keys, but i'll look. Oh, he's only gonna go so far. Yeah, I mean
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:49.840]   I has only so much a guy could do
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:54.720]   You guys really don't
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:56.960]   All right
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:00.000]   Here are all the new features and updates coming to google maps ready
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.960]   Take a picture because it's gonna be quick
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.840]   boom
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.680]   Immersive view
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:09.680]   Neighborhood vibe
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:11.680]   What what's that wait?
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.720]   Instantly see the vibe of any neighborhood through photos information places. Yeah, the hybrid vibe
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:18.800]   Neighborhood yeah
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:21.600]   If it has an artsy vibe or a food scene man
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:24.480]   search with live view
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:29.440]   Uh arrows and directions right on top of your view of the world. I really like this live view thing which
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:32.800]   So you actually be able to work terribly well. I'm trying to go
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:34.880]   They've showed this at google.io for years
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.960]   I know time and time and time again
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:42.000]   So it'll be rolling out in london, new york paris san francisco in tokyo in the coming months on android and ios
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.720]   eco-friendly routing
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.160]   for developers
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.480]   Because god knows developers need to practice eco-friendly. No it means that you'll be able to
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:54.560]   uh put eco-friendly routing into your third party
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:59.200]   Apps which I think is like uber and lift etc etc
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.920]   Great new map features. There you go
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:09.360]   Android auto 8.2 beta is now rolling out tweaks dock of cool walk redesign
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:14.640]   What that's the headline for nine to five google if you don't understand what we're talking about
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:18.160]   You're a good company my friend
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:20.720]   uh
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.720]   Okay, fine
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:29.120]   Tweaks dot you know watch all about android get the inside i don't know ask all about android
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:33.520]   Just ask him and that's the google change law
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.240]   What's the vibe in your town?
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:42.080]   My town is it's a mall, you know, what's it gonna say?
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:48.240]   I actually you know, and now i'm curious well i'll do that after but that's an exercise for later
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:52.480]   Did you watch I did live on monday as nasa
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:54.720]   nudged
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:56.720]   a uh asteroid
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:02.320]   That was so cool and here's the coolest thing go to google and search for dart
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.880]   And your search results will be whoa, whoa watch out. Oh
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:09.120]   knocked sideways
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.120]   By the dart satellite
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.960]   The first time I did this I didn't notice the satellite coming into the picture and knocking it sideways
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:18.800]   I just looked and said what's wrong something's wrong
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.800]   Oh, it's out of alignment
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:27.600]   I made a little fresh program. It's such a cool thing that satellite comes in hits the corner of the dart
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:31.520]   Knowledge graph and now the whole page is is slightly
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:34.400]   Slightly tilted
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:39.840]   Nice touch. Isn't that I thought I just ignored I thought oh, yeah, the computer's doing something weird
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:41.840]   Okay
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:45.440]   Once again, nope. I'm not having a stroke something's wrong
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:52.000]   Isn't that hysterical? Let me let's have you have you watched the pictures of the dart. Did you watch it live?
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.760]   I watch it live. It was yeah, I didn't watch it live. I'll see you in 12th to the second
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:03.600]   Um, so there's so excited they were this is in the lower right hand corner. This is the nasa folks at john's hopkins university
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:09.680]   Uh watching, you know their years of work become true the satellite was just traveling at 14th
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:11.760]   thousand miles an hour
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:14.000]   Is homing in on that little dot
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.760]   Which is p did a most I call it p did a most it's just did a most
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:21.200]   but p didi mose is
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:25.840]   It's just this is time. It's a a kind of a binary
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:28.960]   floating thing. I don't know
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:31.440]   The left the big thing is dimorphous
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:37.200]   On the right the as asteroid did a most they're going to try to hit it smacks square dab in the middle
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.080]   And deflected just ever so slightly as one would do if it were headed for earth
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:44.480]   It's not at seven million miles out not an even bill
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:50.080]   Wouldn't it be ironic though if they hit it and then it hit earth like they accidentally knocked it into her
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:52.640]   law of
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.880]   the uh asked the uh dart uh
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:04.960]   Satellite or whatever it was vehicle thing dart thingy was launched last winter
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:09.600]   It uh came in within 17 meters of its target which you know
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:17.760]   If you aim at something seven million miles away and you hit it within seven meters you does crazy pretty pretty darn good
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:20.240]   That's crazy. Wow
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:23.200]   Pretty pretty good. You see we're slowly moving in
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:27.200]   But it's going to get pretty quick as we get closer you you know as as uh
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:30.800]   Dimorphous goes out of the uh picture on the lower left there
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:34.080]   And we really focus on it did a most you can start to see
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:36.960]   features of uh
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:40.800]   The asteroid like rocks and stuff and surfaces and as you get close to it
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.680]   You know the last frame. It's like that's it
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:46.480]   We we crashed into it
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:54.000]   And the celebrations uh began so you're saying for you you're saying uh now what what what was left to do after this on monday
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.080]   Was to then see how much the uh asteroid was deflected
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:02.800]   I think it's physics. I think they get pretty well predicted. I would bet and they can do that math
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:08.480]   Yeah, they can if they want to figure out how to get within 17 meters, then you believe that seven million miles
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:12.000]   17 meters pretty impressive
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.080]   How big was this thing?
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:18.880]   Uh, I don't know. Do you know uh and how big it is? Well, they'll talk about it on this week in space. I'm sure
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:27.120]   Um, I'm getting the feeling maybe it might be 530 feet in diameter. Oh, it's pretty tiny. Okay. Yeah, okay
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:29.920]   I'm just looking at how many football fields is that?
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:33.520]   Uh, standard unit of of measurement that would be
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.360]   a yard
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.360]   yard of football and a half
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.240]   Football field, but that's all the way around it's the diameter
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:46.320]   So what you're looking at oh actually yeah is is even smaller than a football field. It's a pickle ball. It's a pickle ball court
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.880]   court
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.880]   Our new standard measure
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:58.880]   If I could fly seven million miles and I could fly seven million more
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:04.960]   Just to be the satellite that smashed into your door. Thank you to
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.080]   Gumbie, you know another thing about this though, sir
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:11.760]   It's just how clear look at that these images were look at that wow
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:14.880]   As it gets closer and closer to the far away
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:20.880]   And the transmission it comes back such a clear image pretty impressive how how many
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:23.280]   Newions of years has this been moving around?
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:28.240]   You know, unmolested then suddenly I don't know where what here we go. I do
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.720]   It's the first time in history
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:33.600]   That human beings have moved an object in space
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:35.440]   intentionally
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:42.400]   and uh, it is the first ever planetary defense action there it goes instead, which means it hit the ground
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.160]   And of course the camera immediately died. So you're saying that uh
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:53.120]   78 we have we lost signal we lost signal and they're celebrating huh. Yeah, that's one time you celebrate our
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:58.560]   What line line um line 78 purports to be to show the results
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.440]   images show the chunks
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.680]   The large chunk of at oh look at that
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:11.040]   There's a big dent in it. There's a dent in dinnamos. Wow
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:14.800]   Uh
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:20.400]   Light Italian pubes up for imaging of asteroids which accompanied dart so there was another
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:27.600]   Satellite at their release set of photos on twitter. Yes. There you go. That showed a dimorphous with a big honka out of it
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:29.600]   I
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:31.600]   Holy kimonly
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:33.680]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:38.960]   I mean you said it was going with 17 000 miles per hour 14. Yeah pretty fast
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:42.800]   Pretty pretty fast. Wow. That's cool
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.560]   Now, I guess the next thing is you've got to watch and see how far it was deflected and all that well
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:53.520]   It's it's gonna be it's it's gonna change its orbit around its its cousin there. Yeah. Yeah
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.240]   Oof, there's a big puff. What was that? Was that the dust coming off? That was where you see that was the puff of smoke right below it
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:02.640]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh wow. Oh, it's in the same thread. Yeah
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.080]   So this is I guess this is dinnamos flying through the air. It just got hit
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:09.360]   And they're quite a bit of uh material got ejected
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:13.360]   Dude, dude. That's from a ground based telescope
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.800]   Amazing
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.360]   Amazing. I think this is just really cool. Anyway, it is uh
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:26.480]   And you didn't even need to clarify movies. It is exactly it's amazing
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:31.520]   All right, let's get our picks of the week stacey will be back next week
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:34.800]   Douglas ruschkoff. Thank you for being here his new book
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:38.240]   Uh is is actually really a lot of fun
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:44.160]   But it also is very thought-provoking. It's fun to make fun of rich people. Yeah, I love making fun of rich people
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.160]   um
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:52.240]   Uh, let's see. Oh, what I want to do plug one more time the fact that kori dr. Oh and rebecca ghibli his uh his co-author
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:57.840]   Will be on tomorrow a special triangulation three pm pacific six pm eastern time
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:01.120]   Uh, that's uh 2200 utc
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.680]   We will be talking about their new book chokepoint capitalism
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:11.200]   Which is really if you if you enjoyed or were intrigued by the conversation with that was ruschkoff kind of a continuation
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:17.200]   Yeah along those lines a sequel of sorts jeff actually you know what i'll be a stacey
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:20.320]   Today, okay with a thing of the week
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.320]   Did you uh, I know aunt you must have loved the matrix right
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:33.360]   Mm-hmm great movie great series. I love the second one more than all of them very famous in all of them the rain the green rain
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:38.080]   Right and there've been screen savers and so forth. Well, there's a guy res mason
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:41.040]   Who has spent years of his life
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:43.680]   Trying to improve
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:46.640]   On the green rain and he has a github
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:51.680]   Oh dude, that's pretty you can download his code
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:54.320]   and also
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:59.360]   Variations so in fact, uh lily wachowski was one of the two directors of the matrix
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:03.200]   Series said it's actually probably better than we used in the movie
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.280]   Um, so this is this is all done in a web browser
[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:10.320]   So that looks like we just went from um
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:15.360]   Uh sd to 4k. Yeah, okay ready you want to go 3d
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.080]   Look at this whoa
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:22.000]   Green rain
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.960]   Uh, they used a whole bunch of interesting glyphs including some from susan care who created the original
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:29.600]   icons for the apple macintosh
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:33.360]   There's a holographic version. We can't show you you have to have a looking glass
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:37.600]   Uh display. There's a mirror mode. This is from resurrections
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:41.440]   So it there was a slightly different look at matrix resurrections
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:43.280]   um
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:49.840]   There's a whole bunch of varieties that you could take a look at play with morpheus mode
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.800]   Ooh
[02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:58.800]   Look at that 3d and it's various colors mega city mode. This was in revolutions
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:04.240]   I there's something about it that really is uh is very attractive
[02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:08.480]   Uh, there is a font you can get there's a glyph database
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:14.000]   There is uh, there are command line options you can use to create your own
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:20.640]   Very nice. Uh, this is res mason. He's from vallejo, california just over
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:28.160]   Down the road wrote a piece. Yeah at res mason on twitter. It's on his github github.com/rez
[02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:31.760]   M a s o n. He says coder artist
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:34.480]   something
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:38.400]   So that's my uh stacy's pick for the week jeff you have a number for us
[02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:46.160]   Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do? All right, decisions tick tock were these kids um transparency numbers. Mm
[02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:49.520]   Do you trust them?
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:55.120]   Yeah, yeah for this. I think this is this is saying how much they removed
[02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:58.000]   So they removed total videos removed
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.320]   Against total videos by quarter less than 1%
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:05.280]   That's kind of surprising
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:10.160]   Given all the people I fall in tick tock are always complaining about how their videos were removed. I know
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:13.520]   113 million
[02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:17.760]   Exactly
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:22.720]   From april to june in the quarter 113 million videos removed total
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:26.800]   uh of that 48 million were removed by automation
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:29.280]   and then uh
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:31.680]   5.8 million were um
[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:33.760]   restored
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:41.040]   So a certain percentage of their are brought back uh on appeal but not a lot right it sounds like the automated removal does pretty well
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:46.800]   So if you look at why they were removed 43 percent because of uh minor safety, that's a big one
[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:51.520]   That could be something like a kid doing something dumb by the way. That doesn't have to be yeah
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:53.200]   Good
[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:56.080]   Illegal activities and regulated goods 21 percent
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:33:01.760]   adult due to the oh no we have bodies and sexual activities six 10 percent
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:04.640]   Violent graphic content 9 percent
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:08.080]   Harris but in baleen 5.7 percent with the most important one I think
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:15.600]   Suicide self-armed age or sex 6.1 percent hateful behavior 1.7 percent and violent extremism
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:18.320]   0.9 less than 1 percent
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:21.840]   Is that
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:26.560]   What else is interesting here? I think that's by country
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:29.280]   Uh, it's all purple who cares
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:30.480]   um
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:35.360]   Total account removal so account removal was uh
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:41.280]   Fake accounts removed 33 million
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:43.760]   Wow 20 million
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:47.120]   Because they were suspected to be under the age of 13
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:49.840]   Yep. Wow
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.320]   Uh fake engagement. I'm not sure what that actually means. That's probably more like bots
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:58.560]   14 trillion 40 billion. I mean billion
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.840]   Um fake follow requests prevented 9 billion
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:12.080]   Fake followers removed 1.4 billion. That's interesting. Here's the spam numbers and look they've gone down. I guess everybody went over to twitter
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:19.040]   75 million blocked spam accounts or blocked from creation
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.000]   And then 76 million removed
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:28.960]   So I thought that was fairly um readily actually. Yeah, it's much much better than it's been in past quarters
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:36.400]   Um government request total government requests for takedowns july through December 21th. This is this is not a update never mind
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:41.120]   Yeah, that'll come out. We'll get another one of those in six months
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:46.560]   Yeah, okay, very good those are and and and and and and
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:50.880]   sandwiches made by salt bank. Oh, sorry
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.880]   I
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:57.360]   Never I never plug anything. I never plug it in. I'll go ahead plug something
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:03.120]   By gutenberg the pre-order page for my book the gutenberg breath assistance is coming out next june
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:10.320]   But it's up now that just happened yesterday. So i'm very proud b uy to go so u t y n b e r g
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:12.800]   B it that l y slash by
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:20.000]   Gutenberg, which will bring you the upper right it says us you can buy it in in five different places and divert
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.160]   Nice
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:26.320]   You've written it right this is only good. This is how long it's gonna take him to produce it six months
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:31.520]   Waiting for the copy out next. Yes. Oh, okay stuff to the copy at it. All right. Yeah, this does take a while
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:37.680]   This is why uh, you know maggie haberman's getting a lot of heat because her book
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.360]   Uh
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:43.760]   Contains an admission by dal trump that he took classified documents out of the white house
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:48.160]   She knew about in september, but that's normal these books take six months to get out
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.320]   Or more or more you do wonder why she didn't mention it
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:56.720]   Yeah, yeah, could have said something just a little hint
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:00.320]   mr. At prr what
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.760]   Oh, what are my pigs? Oh
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:08.480]   I have them right here if you if you can't remember remember i have to go down and look
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:10.000]   um
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:15.040]   Couple weeks ago. I had one of my my video monitors that I put on top of my camera
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.720]   Break. Oh to get a new one. So I ended up checking out oc tech
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:27.280]   Uh, I've seen good stuff about him and I decided try one out for myself. I bought bought t5
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:33.280]   And it is a solid dad gum monitor for the price. It was only like a hundred and thirty dollars
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:36.080]   Yeah, that's great affordable, but she get um
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:42.720]   The scopes on the screen you get to see your waveform your false colors and focus pecan and i'm like dude
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:47.040]   This is nice for 130 bucks and just plug it in with an hdmi
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.760]   cable to your camera
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:51.840]   takes uh npf or
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:53.280]   lpe
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:55.760]   e6 batteries from cannon or sony
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:58.800]   Or you can just use like a um d tap
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:00.160]   um
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:05.040]   Battery power to plug it in through the dc port and it rotates you can rotate it to vertical
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.080]   So if you want to shoot something for vertical video, it'll rotate its um orientation
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:12.160]   with your camera
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.240]   Um, it's quite nice. Um considering that that is pretty much doing everything those
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:21.520]   Atomos ninjas are doing, but it's a lot like 125 bucks
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:27.440]   It's a lot cheaper and then I also have the this I think it's the seven inch q7
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.000]   So no t7
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.080]   And it's the seven inch version. It's just bigger
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:36.240]   Does everything and I just say it accept this bigger and it's brighter is 3000 nits
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:38.240]   So it's really really bright outside
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:40.800]   nice
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:45.360]   Very good for everybody. This is mostly shooting video. Yeah. Yeah shooting you don't need it for stills
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:49.680]   Yeah, you don't need it for stills. Yeah, but if you're shooting video most of the time
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:55.920]   Um those better angles you're holding the camera like right probably around your chest or so or a little bit lower
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.480]   So you can't see your viewfinder. That's why you need a monitor. Also this records, right?
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:06.800]   Yes, you can throw a sd card in and record to it. I don't recommend that. Oh, okay, but
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:12.160]   Because most sd cards are not reliable and slow. Yeah. Yeah
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:15.200]   Very nice
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:18.640]   My next one is one more little reminder of the dobe max
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:25.120]   But who hold on jeff had jeff wants to stick something in that's okay. Hold on. Well, I think for for athletic
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:27.600]   Uh uh aunt here

[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:38.720]   Sorry
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:45.920]   Well, I'm finished with I had a reminder in my mailbox about adorbi max and I said i'd mention that again because it's free virtually
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.640]   Um, so people go check it out. Um, my friend claudie. She's going to be speaking there
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:57.360]   Um mr. Day Clayton another friend of mine. He's going to be speaking there and I still want to show some love and they updated the list

[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.280]   And mr. It's always funny to see those comedians because they're
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:11.040]   They're in a crowd of nerds, you know creative nerds and
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:17.680]   They come on stage and they do the adobe sneaks where they preview some stuff that adobe's working on
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:20.400]   and you know, they sort of
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:24.960]   Weigh out at the stuff that they're being shown in their own little comedic style
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:30.480]   It's pretty funny like I remember tiffany haddish being there and john malaney being there and just having them interact
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.640]   With these geeks and nerds that are showing some really cool AI stuff on the stage is pretty funny
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:43.120]   I can't wait that sounds like fun. This is free. It's in l.a. Jeff, but it's uh, you could do it virtually. So that's the key

[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:54.160]   But oh you mean like you wait a minute. Okay. Just what just michael gueira and talian cyclist
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:56.160]   Guys, it's like knowledge of
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:01.440]   Physics and aerodynamics to adopt a plank position. Oh, that's because he's more aerodynamic
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:03.840]   It's downhill. He doesn't need to pedal
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:04.960]   Look at that
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.240]   He's beating these guys because he's because he doesn't have the wind resistance aerodynamic
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:10.720]   Oh, dude
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:14.720]   And keep keep going can you imagine be that being one of the competitors seeing him do this?
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:16.240]   Do you see the guy on the motorcycle?
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:18.800]   He's gonna beat the motorcycle
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, wow. I can't wait to see this in the tour de france
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:25.280]   Wow
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:30.560]   Some serious injuries. Yeah, this could be very dangerous if you fell
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:33.520]   It's also pretty ballsy
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:40.880]   Dude, really it's ballsy just to ride this bicycle this past anyway. He was sitting up. I don't know if it's any more dangerous this way
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:48.480]   Uh, but I watch the other motorcycles can actually pass the guy in a motorcycle. What what double-titch
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:58.960]   Okay, that's a sad way one more the next thing he has to do is he's gonna get off the plank
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:05.280]   But the wheels are going so fast. Yeah, you gotta use his shoes your core wheels
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.480]   Just slow down the bike so that's the hard part. You can't get the pedals
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:13.520]   Isn't that unbelievable kids
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:20.160]   Do not try this at home. I guarantee you that would be taken down from tick tock as being way too dangerous
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:25.440]   That's crazy athlete. So oh yeah and a nut job
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:31.520]   And then you could you could one more one one one second video you couldn't let me out of dynamic island one line above
