[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google ants here. Jeff's here. Stacey has the week off.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160]   But good news. Kathy Gillis, attorney at law, is joining us.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920]   Just off the Supreme Court, she was there this morning to hear arguments in a very important
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960]   copyright case. She'll give us an update. We'll also talk about the new Pixel 7 and the Pixel
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.400]   Watch-er-bye you may or may not want it. And the MetaQuest Pro. It sounds like a pharmaceutical,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   but it's actually the latest in VR from Meta. But who wants it? We'll find out next on Twig.

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.160]   He's got we got a card for you, Ant.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.520]   Ant. Welcome from TV's Hands-On Photography.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   I'm doing great community manager in our club to it. We also have Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.680]   Tau professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig. New my graduate school of journalism at
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   the city university of New York. His car has got a little more written on it.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   And this is very good news. I have a card for our special guest, Stacey Broker,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.440]   toe last night. So Kathy, Catherine, our gales Esquire is here from CG Council.com.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.200]   Former internet professional webmaster now assisting clients with legal issues related to
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.280]   the digital age. Hi, Kathy. Hello. You're in DC. I'm in DC. And why are you in DC?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   You know, I guess if you're a lawyer, it's good to go where it gets made sometimes.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.200]   You went to the sausage factory in Pertons. I went to the sausage factory, yes.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   And I understand that today you were in the Supreme Court. Yes, there was an important copyright
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.760]   hearing at the US Supreme Court. And I wrote a amicus brief in the case. And it's interesting to
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.880]   kind of see it live as they talk about really important issues and what they're going to do
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.960]   about it that are going to affect all our lives. I bet you, Kathy knows how to pronounce
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:34.480]   certiorari. I think I've been saying amicus. It's amicus amicus. I think it could be either.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   Some people seem to say it's the way that I don't pronounce it and they're just wrong.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.920]   So I think you can have whatever your own natural accent provides. Last time, just doing a brief
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.720]   get you a ticket into the Supreme Court? No, no, it did not. I had to stand online. I got there
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.920]   at 6 a.m. And they only took 19 of the Supreme Court guard people. But I got in. But my friends
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.280]   who got there at 8 a.m. didn't. In previous years, I'd actually camped out for a case. I camped out
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.240]   for Ariel because they were line sitters. And it was so competitive that we were afraid that we
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.720]   wouldn't get in. But then after that case, Justice Scalia said enough of this nonsense.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   Your license by this court stopped hiring line standards. So you had to do your own standing.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.400]   And lawyers are lazy. So we just show up for the Supreme Court. Have you argued?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.360]   I am, which is I could in theory. It's also how I made a file. Amicus briefs there. If I weren't
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.760]   barred at that court, I couldn't be the attorney that did that. Oh, so the onion is barred at the
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   Supreme Court? They had to hire some. No, the onion had counsel that was barred in the Supreme
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   Court to file it. I mean, they may be barred by the Supreme Court at some point. After that
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.040]   brief, but we should probably explain. Bard in means you it's like passing the bar. You're a
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   do you zero test? How do you get barred into the Supreme Court? No, for so you get licensed by
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.520]   state and they're the ones who in theory are testing are doing the full test of moral character
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   and in theory, you know, your competence to be a lawyer. That's what people take the bar example
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.240]   open question about whether it's actually an effective test of competence. But that's what
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.760]   they do. But then different courts in the federal system do their own admissions if you want to
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.160]   practice before them. I think the individual district courts and for them, you sometimes just need to
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.440]   pay a fee. Sometimes you pay a fee and add a little bit on a form. Sometimes you need references.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.920]   And then for the US Supreme Court, it's basically the same thing. It was mostly a form, but you had
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   to have been in practice, I think three years, although maybe five, and you had to get people that
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   signed your form kind of as movements. So like they moved to have you admitted in the US Supreme
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.880]   Court. So it's a little more formal. But basically, all you have to do is be a lawyer,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.200]   not get in trouble and fill out a form. But if you do get in trouble after you can get kicked out,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.920]   my understanding is that Bill Clinton after he was impeached got kicked out of the Supreme Court
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.240]   bar because they didn't like that nonsense. He wasn't a good moral character, etc. Do you get a
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   bumper sticker or anything? You get a little something to put on your desk? They sent a certificate.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.480]   A lot of the court sent a certificate. My certificate, I think if I remember, is quite
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.920]   is sort of large because it's the US Supreme Court. But the interesting thing was there were
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.600]   two people that had to get signed. One, I think was a reference, but the other was called the
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.520]   movement. And I got my Con Law Professor from Law School, the really scary kind of paper chase
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.760]   Con Law Professor. He signed mine. And for some reason, that name, then when I got my certificate,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.560]   his name is like, and the person who moved you is, and so my Con Law Professor is on my Supreme
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.120]   Court certificate for having moved me into the Supreme Court. That was kind of cool. I actually
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.720]   thought that was like an accident. That was a nice accident that happened. So yeah, mostly paperwork,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.440]   but you know, sometimes learning is all about the paperwork. So you know, you do paperwork.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   You chose it. Right. Well, not for the paperwork, but yes.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.800]   So why you're there for the Andy Warhol case? Tell us why you're there.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.400]   So there were a couple of cases, losing track of time now, time, how does it work a couple years
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.520]   ago, case in the second circuit coming out of New York and a case also that was similarly
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.680]   troubling that ended up coming out of the Ninth Circuit. What these cases essentially did was
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.560]   decide that subsequent works didn't count as fair uses. And if they didn't count as fair uses,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:48.800]   then they would be infringing copyright. So both cases ended up, they both won at the district
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.440]   court were both of these subsequent uses that used another work were found to be fair uses of
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.880]   the work. In the Ninth Circuit, this was the case involving the Dr. Seuss mashup with the
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.120]   oh, the places will boldly go where somebody wrote a book that took Star Trek imagery
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.880]   and combined it with Dr. Seuss motifs. Bad taste, but not illegal.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.080]   Actually, it was it was really well done. Actually, I think it was quite clever. Like, you know,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.320]   it really kind of really united those things in actually a really meaningful way that
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.120]   added new meaning. And that's important. We'll get back to new meaning. Meanwhile,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.520]   there was also a case in New York, and this was less recent, but there had been a photograph of
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:39.040]   Andy Warhol taken in like the early 80s that then ended up that Andy Warhol then ended up adapting
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.160]   and turning into the really famous Prince PRI and TS of Prince PRI and CE. This is a very
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.760]   good picture of Prince, not Andy Warhol. It was a this picture from the 80s. Lynn Goldsmith took
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.800]   the picture. And this is Andy Warhol's portrait. Even before then, wasn't there a
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.200]   AP suit shepherd fairy over this famous Obama Hope poster because an AP photographer
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.280]   took the picture. That one was settled out of court.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:15.120]   Yeah, that one hit a weird roadblock in discovery and never really got decided on the merits of
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.600]   everyone kind of bailed out of that case. So it wasn't really figured out, but there was an
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.280]   important case in I guess the late 80s called Campbell versus A.K.F. Rose. And this was a really
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.520]   important fair use case that the Supreme Court considered. This is the one where,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:37.680]   and now I'm blanking on the name, it was was it beasts? So there was a take off of Pretty Woman
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.560]   that was a very raunchy take off parody. It was two life crew, yeah.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   Two life crew, yeah. And that was a really important case because Breo Bisson or his estate really
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.520]   didn't like that. It was, you know, it's not a it's a kind of crude song, and they didn't like
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.000]   the they called it infringement and they didn't like that. It was messing with their song.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.400]   And the Supreme Court said, no, you know, we really need to create space to have
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.440]   new meanings and new things come out. This has to be a fair use. But you know, that case can
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   really only reach the merits for what the facts of that case were challenging it for.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.080]   But it had a lot of it had language for how to think about a situation like that. And then it had
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.560]   some other helpful dicta that sort of helped guide courts in the future to find that other
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.120]   subsequent uses, even when it used identifiable source works could still be considered fair use.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.320]   One of the tests in the two life crew case was, did it have a cause commercial harm
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.200]   to Roy Orbison? Would it cause loss of sales to Pretty Woman? And the Supreme Court said,
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.800]   it's extremely unlikely.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:53.680]   I mean, that that is true. So fair use, built into the statute has a multi factor test. It's not
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.240]   necessarily exhaustive, but there are four factors that used to be thought of at common law, but
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.760]   then they kind of baked them in the statute when they updated the copyright statute for the 1976 act.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.680]   And I don't I should pull them up. I don't have the front of it. But okay, so there's four factors
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.960]   that you look at. And you kind of analyze, okay, so you have the original work, and then you have
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.120]   the subsequent work. And let's say, especially that the subsequent work is, you know, somehow
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.840]   harkening back and identifiable way to the original, that may still be fair use, but you're going to
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:30.960]   decide if it's fair use by thinking through those factors. So that's great, but it's also really,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:38.240]   really, really fuzzy. Yeah, and fair use is is somebody once said merely the right to hire a
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.880]   lawyer that Lawrence loves like something. Yeah, Larry Lessick. So the four cases are
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.160]   the purpose of the use, whether it's for commercial, for instance, or nonprofit or educational,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.320]   that's number one, number two, the nature of the copyrighted work, number three, the amount and
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.400]   substantiality of the portion used. And number four, the effect of the use upon the potential
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:07.440]   market or value of the copyrighted work. And that's it was that fourth test. The Supreme Court said,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:16.240]   yeah, you didn't cost Roy Orbison anything. I'd heard also that the parody defense.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:24.640]   So for instance, when Weird Al makes a parody song, it has to parody the original maker of the
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.400]   song. It can't be devoid of that. It can't has to refer back to the original.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:38.880]   That's not in the more for certain. Yeah, because some of it has to do with commentary, like fair
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:45.120]   use commentary, there you go. First Amendment rights to have free expression and copyright
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.840]   and theory and pinches on that. But one of the ways that copyright is not in compliant with the
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.280]   first amendment is to make sure that you still have free expression around it. And fair use helps
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.720]   preserve the ability to freely express other things. It's there to help vindicate that other
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.400]   expression can happen. So if you're commenting on the original, then that tends to be more clearly.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.640]   And there's there's precedent, I think, on point about this to say, well, okay, you know,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   we can't make that illegal because then we'd have a First Amendment problem. But that doesn't
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.200]   necessarily mean that other types of expression couldn't be legal to, but sometimes it's not tested
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   or then you get these cases that I'm describing where all of a sudden, like the district court
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.320]   looked at them and looked at these subsequent uses and said, yes, they're fair use. But on appeal,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   the appeals courts said, now we don't think so. They basically reran the four factor test and
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.840]   reran it in a way that looked at the subsequent use and said, nope, nope, nope, we don't see
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.160]   clear to do this, this must be infringing. And so this case at the US Supreme Court was,
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.600]   hang on, it doesn't look like the way, and I bring up the Ninth Circuit case because it was similar
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.720]   and I think really troubling. And in a way that I think highlights what was troubling about this
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.000]   one somewhat more clearly. But in this particular case where the Second Circuit said, nope, Andy
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.840]   Warhol must have infringed essentially when his prints were not, his prints prints were not fair use.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.360]   All of a sudden there's a question about is that decision right, but also what would it mean for
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.120]   any subsequent uses because the logic they used in running those four factor tests would shut down
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.000]   an awful lot of other expression that happens to build on other works. And you really need to be
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.640]   able to build on other works to be able to say new things. So that would create a really chilling
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.560]   effect. So what was before the court today was, hang on a second, did the Second Circuit get it right?
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.160]   And they were talking most particularly about the fourth factor, but also the first factor
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   with new with the purpose and character of the work and questions about whether the new work
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.960]   brought new meaning. And if yes, what is the significance that it did bring new meaning and
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.600]   how should that come so many years? Let me give you the facts of the case so you understand that.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.240]   Thank you. The picture was taken in 1981 for the
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:14.640]   by a photographer Goldsmith before he was famous. Three years later, Vanity Fair commissioned Andy
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.560]   Warhol for a series of six silkscreen prints as well as two pencil sketches based on the original
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:33.520]   photograph and published them. However, the Vanity Fair had obtained a license from Goldsmith,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:41.280]   but she said she was not aware that Warhol created other images that were not licensed. In fact,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   she only became aware after Condi Nast used a different image when she had not licensed
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   as part of a 2016 Prince tribute. Mealy had lost death. Of course, Warhol died in '87.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:00.960]   The relevant works are held by the Andy Warhol Foundation, which had given permission
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.560]   to Vanity Fair to use the image in 2016, but Goldsmith was not created. So that's when she
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.120]   sued. In 2019, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Andy Warhol Foundation,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.120]   saying the images were transformative because while Goldsmith's photo showed a vulnerable
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.320]   human being, the Warhol prints depicted an iconic larger-than-life figure. Actually,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:31.840]   that sounds like they were ruling against the foundation. I think that NBC got this one wrong.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.520]   Ruled against the foundation, the foundation then sought Supreme Court review after the second
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.440]   court ruled in favor of the photographer in March 2021. Goldsmith holds the Warhol
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:52.720]   version, and they were saying the Warhol version was in fact a larger-than-life image. So they
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.000]   were in favor of the foundation against Goldsmith. Yes, you're right. And then in under a few,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.640]   the second circuit said, "No, no, the photographer wins. The appeals court faulted the district court
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.400]   for focusing on the artist's intent, saying that the judge should not assume the role of art critic."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.840]   Yeah, it's interesting. Instead, a judge must examine whether the new work is of a completely
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   different character to the original. It must, quote, "at a bare minimum, comprise something more
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.000]   than the imposition of another artist's style on the primary work." That's part of the comment.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   That's a nonsensical one. That takes us to the Supreme Court. Kathy, what did your amicus brief
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:46.720]   say? Our amicus brief, I did this for the Copian Institute, which is the think tank half of Tector,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   is we base two big points. One was to remind the court that copyright law has to
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   comport with the First Amendment. So the first half of the thing was talking about,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.480]   if copyright law is all of a sudden saying no to free expression or somehow not helping further
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.040]   the progress of arts and sciences, which the Constitution says is what copyright is for,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.280]   then you've got a problem. And so if you're looking at a case where all of a sudden you're saying no
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.880]   to further expression, that suggests that if that's the way copyright law is being interpreted,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.040]   you have a problem. And then when you talked further about the reason I talk about the Dr.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:32.240]   Seuss case, I was so alarmed by that case in the Ninth Circuit basically saying, "How dare you
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:39.520]   create something new that the original copyright holder for all Dr. Seuss works is not, didn't
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.480]   license you to do." And just how foreclosing that would be if the original copyright holder
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.400]   could say no to things. And we also pointed out that it's different in this case, in this Warhol
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   case where Warhol, the subsequent user is dead and the photographer is still alive. But in the Dr.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.680]   Seuss case, it was the other way around. The estate of a dead person was saying no to the new
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.880]   creative work of a live person. And if that's something that copyright law says is okay, I think
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.360]   we have to think twice about it, especially given the really long terms that copyright has.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:18.240]   That's a problem, I think, if that can happen. And so we pointed out how that fact alone helps
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:25.200]   illustrate what happens when you kill the ability of other people to rebuild things and create
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.720]   something that might never have existed if the original creator, I mean, a dead person is never
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.440]   going to do it. But maybe they wouldn't have licensed things anyway. The Ninth Circuit sort of took
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:42.320]   the view of like, well, as a copyright holder, they could have decided to license to a Star Trek
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.680]   mashup or a, I don't know, a Mickey Mouse mashup or any sort of other mashup that they wanted,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.040]   that they chose to license. But either nobody knocked on their door or they weren't interested in doing
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.320]   the deal. So none of those mashups happened, especially not one with this particular expression
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.880]   in charm until this artist independently thought I can make a fair use by combining these two things
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.760]   and creating something new. The district court said that looks good under the four factor fair use
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.080]   test and relying on the Campbell versus a cover rose test. And then the Ninth Circuit just sort of
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.760]   said, nope, nope, you're too greatly cutting into the exclusive rights of the copyright holder.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.480]   And that's something that came up today because copyright also, one of the exclusive rights that
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   a copyright holder has is to control derivative works. And there's a tension in the copyright
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:38.000]   act between a derivative work and the fair uses of works, which may be transformative in their
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.800]   meanings. And so what is the difference between a transformative work and a derivative work,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.560]   because one would be legal as a fair use and the other one would not. And this is actually when
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.640]   I was learning copyright law was really confusing and made me very frustrated, like how do I learn
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.840]   this? Like how do I get my head around that tension? And the tension is sitting in the statute,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.880]   but what the Warhol side was arguing a little bit is that the text does sort of say that like
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:11.040]   the derivative work right is subject to fair use, the fair use rules as well. And then they kind of
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.400]   point out what would it mean to subsequent free expression if because everybody somehow references
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:24.880]   a source work somehow. What is there didn't basis no white on nothing. And of course,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.160]   famously Walt Disney then copyright, it's no one else can make us no white. The brothers
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.440]   grim, I guess didn't get their day in court. So today was the day for oral arguments in front
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.920]   of the Supreme Court. That's why you were there among other things we learned that Clarence Thomas
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.160]   was a Prince fan who knew one but not necessarily anymore only on Thursday's apparel.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:54.720]   So the thing unfolded where he started with a hypothetical of let's say I were a Prince fan
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.840]   and then he says under his breast like which I was back in the 80s and then I somebody I think
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.920]   Justice Kagan kind of piped up and no longer and so everybody in the room laughed and then he kind
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.960]   of pulled himself together and said well only on Thursdays. So the just interesting because
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.120]   you don't usually think of the Supreme Court as having any banter during these oral arguments
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.000]   but they do actually. You know one of my takeaways I was telling somebody is I'm actually really
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.760]   glad I went as somebody who practices before the court because I've been really really angry with
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.640]   them and for good reason. Their jurisprudence has been frightening the way they've been
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.880]   comporting themselves has been disturbing. They've really sort of taken themselves down a notch in
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.440]   in this demon what they're worthy and also but what happens to our symptom of law if it's not.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.200]   Like you know we talked at the beginning of the show about what it was like you know getting admitted
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.920]   to the Supreme Court bar. The first thing they do before every oral argument is there's some
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.240]   people who actually get admitted on the spot like their papers are all in but then the court verbally
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.320]   grant that their motions be granted and then they're given the oath on the spot and there's like all
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.360]   this dignity built into it. So when they're kind of cutting corners and changing the rules and this
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.160]   then the other thing it's really heartbreaking almost on a religious level of like you know this is
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:20.400]   something we really kind of revere and need to revere. So my attitude has been very very cynical
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.160]   growingly cynical. I kind of appreciated being in the room and being reminded of the human beings.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.640]   I mean I don't think it redeems the systemic things that are so troubling but I think it made me not
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.920]   hate them quite so much and I think I needed to be reminded that these are people and that my
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.120]   skills and my writing could still potentially speak to these people. They have ways of thinking
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.880]   about things and my job as a practitioner is figuring out how to convey something that they can hear.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.240]   They're not gods although they have godlike power in some cases.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.080]   But I was actually surprised by the report. They seem to be collegial. They seem to get along.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.120]   They did. Yeah. Interesting. Kathy I saw a tweet today. I couldn't get in the context of it so I
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   just saw somebody come. Oh my god the government's arguing against fair use. That's not true at all.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:19.120]   It's not true at all. It's a debate about what is fair use right?
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.840]   I am well blitting the baby a little bit. I think Jeff is actually more correct.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:36.240]   Really? They basically took the photographer side and their model for how they did it I think
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.160]   was troubling. It's been too long since I've seen it but Mark Lemley kind of summed it up in two
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.440]   lines of like if this is what they were arguing some fundamental thing is missing. But overall
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.160]   and I can't remember what that was even though it was pity incorrect. But I think the model that
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.360]   they want is really one that closes the door on an awful lot of fair uses and they were explicitly
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.240]   taking the side of the photographer and not on the side of the derivative work.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.520]   I think some of the biggest argument was well because one of the problems is that this is
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:14.160]   involving photography and photography has such a limited runway in terms of how it can be monetized
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.520]   and it's so easy to copy and photographers were writing really panicked amicus briefs saying like
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.080]   if you grant this as fair use photography is dead. I think that might be overstating it and I think
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.840]   there's still monetization models in this than the other thing. But it is a very difficult medium
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:36.720]   to protect especially if you have expansive fair use so that that's true. I think the government's
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.080]   position was but we've got some licensing models that provide monetization that creates income
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.800]   and if you have too much fair use then those licensing models will fall apart and the economics
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.720]   of photography will change. And I can see the alarm and the government wanting to sort of protect
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.600]   photographers but I think they're trying to protect the photographers at the expensive photographers
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.880]   themselves because it's at the expense of anybody who would like to make subsequent expression
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.240]   and sometimes that's photographers that everybody needs fair use to be able to sort of speak because
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.920]   we always reference it some way something that came before and the longer a copyright term the more
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.200]   expansive a copyright seems to be the more exclusive rights and the more powerful those rights
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.400]   the harder it is for anybody to speak and I think that's dangerous. I think they are taking the
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.920]   wrong view and needed to take a more global view of we got to keep people talking and if we want
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   to keep people creating. Here's a dumb question. Oh, why is the government already?
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.920]   A couple of points to be because one is that oral arguments aren't always the best way to
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:48.400]   understand the justices point of view on this right? True. It's very difficult to read the tea
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.280]   leaves off of an oral argument. Second point you can listen for yourself the Supreme Court publishes
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.160]   the audio not the video but the audio from oral arguments and this one's already up
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:05.520]   of all things. Now 42 was live. It's actually I mean the pandemic made a mess of so much but one of the
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.320]   benefits of the pandemic is that this court used to not have any live broadcast or live of anything
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:19.440]   of any of their hearings and they started doing live simulcast only sound not video but they started
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.840]   doing that during the pandemic and they just really last week this week opened up to having the public
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.800]   in in the court for oral arguments again because it had still been closed for the pandemic and there
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.000]   was a question of well when people can come back in or they're going to turn off the simulcast and
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.200]   know they kept it on and this is to the court's credit. I think it's really important and I hope
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.280]   they keep it going and the fact that they did so far makes me hope that they will. Yeah,
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.360]   so they forgot to turn it off. Supreme Supreme Court? No, I think they did it on purpose. They
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.280]   did it. They were doing it. If you go to supremecourt.gov and click the oral arguments link at the top
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   you'll see all of the weeks oral arguments so far and you can listen to it including today's.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   Okay, Jeff sorry. I just need to wake up at 6am. This is a silly visit. I just had a dumb question
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.760]   Kathy. In a case like this where it's one party against the other, why is the government a party
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:20.400]   and is the government always a party? It's not a party. It was I don't actually know what it's
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.640]   it might be an intervener but I don't know what essentially happens is I mean sometimes I guess
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:33.200]   the government might intervene versus goldsmiths. It's like foundation versus a photographer.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.680]   So why was the government making arguments today? Sometimes the court actually asked the
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.440]   government to lodge a view. I don't remember if it was done on invitation this time or or
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.520]   there might have been a motion that the government wrote its brief and then say we want it we want
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.840]   to submit it. The other thing that we're the argument was Yaira Dubin who was Mika's Curia.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.920]   So it was essentially another Mika's. What they got is the oral argument and that is they had to
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.680]   do that on an ask but I think it was unopposed. I think if the government shows up and says we'd
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.920]   like to speak to it it did it. What did what did Dubin say? What was her position?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.320]   Well the government took the same position that it took in the briefs which is they were very
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:24.000]   worried about the fair use test. If fair use could be found the way Warhol was arguing they were
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.720]   afraid of the consequences. They did not want a test that was that broad. So that's interesting.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.520]   And so they were much more limited. They were somewhat differing from what the photographer
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:38.640]   was saying in terms of what the test should be but but basically they're calling with lobby
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   narrow test and a broader test. This is more they took the Hollywood side versus the Silicon
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.160]   Valley side. I'm reading Lawrence Hurley's article for NBC. He said that the justices
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   seemed to focus on purpose of the images Warhol's image versus Goldsmith's image and
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:08.640]   that the fact that they were both used in the same way to illustrate articles about the singer
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:16.880]   seemed to be an issue. That that Judge Sotomayor said does the fact that the images have the same
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:23.280]   market? Is that enough to destroy your defense? Justice Gorsuch said the prince images were quite
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:29.200]   different from Warhol's images of Campbell's soup cans because the difference in purpose
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.040]   in the latter instance was obvious. He wasn't trying to sell Campbell's soup.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.840]   So Gorsuch said that okay the Campbell's because they're using Warhol imagery as an example. So
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.240]   Warhol has the famous Campbell's soup cans sitting in a you know a picture by itself.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:50.800]   And Gorsuch basically said well that's an easier case to find the fair use because
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.120]   the original label is designed to sell soup and this purpose is designed to you know antagonize
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.720]   the consumer state or something like that. Like you know you're not using them.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.840]   So far. They don't have the same function essentially but they're looking at essentially
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:11.440]   two pictures of Prince and they're like they have the same function in that they are to convey
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.240]   a picture of Prince and in this case more specifically in the in the magazine.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   Although Chief Justice Roberts said no it's a different style to different purpose. One is a
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.400]   commentary on modern society. The other is to show what Prince looks like. So he argued again.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.160]   Wow. You can't tell. Read too much of the tea leaves here.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.520]   Hair splitting. Well but that's what the Supreme Court does.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.720]   Well so so Roberts was sort of getting back to what the district court found.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.200]   The district court made the point which I think is valid which is if you look at those two pictures
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.920]   and you had that up on the screen and I think it it illustrates it. The original picture that
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:58.560]   Goldsmith took portrays Prince as kind of as a different sort of person with a different sort of
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:05.280]   persona than the adapted one that Warhol did. So what Warhol foundations argument is is they're
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:12.320]   not conveying the same thing. The way Warhol treated that image in creating his transformative work
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.080]   transformed it in a way where it said something else about Prince that the original one hadn't
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.800]   said. And then the question they were saying that well the test is that the purpose is that they
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.040]   are saying something different about Prince. Like yes they're both pictures. Yes they're both
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.640]   pictures that may be used in a magazine to illustrate an article about Prince. But they are saying
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   different things. And I think one argument that got left on the on the table. Although the Warhol
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.760]   sort of side sort of intimated at it is that you know they're not yes they're competing
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.840]   with each other but they're not competing with each other as literal copies of each other.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.120]   They're competing with each other like not for price and sale term or licensing terms or this
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.520]   than the other thing. They're essentially competing each other for if you're doing an article about
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.960]   Prince which is the image that you think conveys the thing about Prince that you wish to have
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.280]   convey is to complement your article. Like they'll tell you to have a I make one.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.560]   That message. I'm sorry. I'll just have a I make one. I'll just have a you know Dali make one.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   And it will be a difference which is a question actually Kathy. Was there any discussion in the
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:25.520]   court today of the remaking mode of online and how art is changing now in a collaborative way of
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:32.560]   re-constant remix? I think not and probably thank goodness if it came up it did not linger very
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.000]   long it does not ring a bell and boy that gives me a headache but because if we're having enough
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.040]   problems with like what humans can do we're not at the point of. Well I'm not talking about the AI
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.840]   I'm not talking about the AI I'm talking about about any old schmoe using Instagram to remake
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:56.640]   something to make a statement. The remixing of culture today is on a such a different scale
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.400]   and if they try to cut off that from anybody it's one matter to you know use a photo you don't
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.800]   have permission for it's another matter to make a comment on it buy your use of it in just the
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.480]   fact that anyone can do that now and it's not just Vanity Fair. It's a much broader market.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:20.080]   Oh the Warhol Foundation made a point which is that one of the things that the photographer
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.920]   and I think even the government may have argued is that everybody oh and I think even the second
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.040]   circuit was that they sort of got stars in their eyes where oh it's a warhol thing so it must be
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.760]   different and special because it's warhol. It's famous and we're looking back on it and that
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   because it was a warhol thing we're going to look at it differently and of course we're going to
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   assume that there's a different meaning and so there's sort of bootstrapping on the fame to
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.280]   decide that there's different meaning and the Warhol Foundation sort of pointed out of like no
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:53.120]   it's not about us. This is really about the unknown artist who wants to create work that remixes and
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:59.600]   reuses something that came before and even to have the fame to be able to like all of a sudden like
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.680]   oh because you don't know his name so if you hear Joe Schmoe's New York you're not going to
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.840]   presume oh it's something new and different you're just going to know it's a subsequent work and
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.120]   that you're not going to have that that reputation to enhance the concept of meaning and he's like
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.200]   so it can't be dependent on this reputation because what our job is is to protect those new artists
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.360]   who someday may be the Warhols but they're never going to be the Warhols because they're going to be
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:30.800]   too scared to ever make any work because this is because it won't be enough that it has enough
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.840]   a different meaning because it'll still be identified as the original one and then both the Goldsmith
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.160]   and even the government were making this point which is that well Fair Use is an affirmative defense
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.480]   which is getting back to that lesson quote that Fair Use is the right to hire a lawyer.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.320]   That's not useful if you're a creator if you have to hire a lawyer or to defend yourself and hope
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.240]   that a court sees it your way you're not going to produce the air at all. We deal with that all
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.680]   the time there's a chilling effect and we're always here always aware of that chilling effect
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.720]   because I don't want to have to defend it in court even though I firmly believe most of what we do
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.840]   is Fair Use because we're news and we're covering news. I'm going to ask you as a photographer because
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:16.160]   I think you have a dog in this hunt as a photographer. When I look at this is from the Skoda's blog
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:24.080]   images. So this is on the right is the actual Lyn Goldsmith 1981 photograph of Prince. On the
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:32.000]   left is the Vanity Fair cover in which they're using that photograph essentially modified by Andy
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.760]   Warhol. They did pay Lyn Goldsmith I think 400 bucks for the right to do that. It was
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:46.240]   only the other images that she saw later the customer to sue. What's your reaction to this?
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.880]   Are you naturally on the side of the photographer?
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.760]   In this instance I'm standing with the photographer.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:02.320]   She took this picture. Yeah right we set rates from client to client. You know their portrait
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.280]   photographers out there that will charge X amount of dollars to certain individuals
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.080]   but if that individual is a CEO of Google is probably going to charge that person a little bit more
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.640]   because of reach and other places that image can be shown and we want to make sure we capitalize
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.960]   properly offer that. How do you feel now if I show you the other images which are much more
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:34.400]   clearly artworks that weren't licensed and this is what she's suing over. Does that change it?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:41.040]   Nope that's still my shot. That's a derivative of my capture. You didn't capture this.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:49.200]   That's how I look at it. We're talking about the AI earlier. I thought the AI had some type of
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.920]   fences in place that no it doesn't. I tried to stop from putting like I can put prints in
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.320]   but it's not going to give me an actual picture of prints. Oh maybe but the AI style of Warhol.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:09.280]   Yeah you could say I want to draw a drawing of prints in the style of Warhol. It's more about Warhol
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.720]   and taking the style than necessarily an image because the AI can do 100 images of prints.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   Dolly too is much more careful about images of people but stable diffusion is not at all
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.120]   and you can very much with stable diffusion you get prints pictures. You can probably get this
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:31.600]   picture because the larger question here it trains and all these images and it could train on this
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.520]   image much from Scotus blog really. But that's the thing training on something to have as a
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   background is one thing reproducing to your exact same image. I think that's problematic.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:51.360]   How close is close? And this is what Kathy was talking about. What about derivative? Walt Disney
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:00.640]   didn't make up Sleeping Beauty. He derived it from the Brothers Grimm. Much of art is based on previous
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.480]   works of art. And that's how an artist proceeds. You've learned photography by looking a lot of
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.240]   people's photographs and it could in fact be that some of your images. Trying to imitate other
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.800]   photographers. Exactly. Exactly. That's how it works. So Ben and others you society sees this and
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:23.600]   this is why there's limits on copyright. Society sees this as a societal good that things are
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.280]   copyright for a limited period of time but then enter into the public domain where others can
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:37.280]   elaborate on them and become part of the kind of. In fact this is what Larry Lesig was so interested
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.920]   in when he created Creative Commons. He said public domain saying I'm going to put this public
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.600]   domain is insufficient. Copyright is too much. There needs to be something in between that allows
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.280]   me as a creator to assert certain rights but to still allow people to create derivative rights.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.640]   Kathy am I saying that? You feel like is that accurate?
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:06.880]   Creative Commons. Oh she disappeared. Creative Commons tweeted and I dig this tweet and says
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.240]   even with the Creative Commons license fair use is key to free expression. Everything builds on
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.080]   other works and copyright depends. Just as you were saying everything builds on other works and
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:22.240]   copyright depends on limitations and expectations. So they're hoping that the courts recognize this
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:28.160]   in the cases today. Let me see if I can get a portrait of Prince in the style of Andy Warhol.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:34.880]   I just put in this one is this is this is Lexica. This is yeah you have mid journey this is
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:41.840]   this is Lexica and these are all AI generated that's Britain's obviously.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:48.640]   There's Michael Jackson somehow snuck in. So I mean that you know by the way.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:54.400]   Those really close to being one thing that we didn't mention is where a prince is right.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.280]   All of this none of this is gone. They're gone. He has no rights. He let the photographer take
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.640]   the picture. Well he wouldn't have had a copyright in his face and this is actually also sort of an
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.440]   important point. There's other things that are running through copyright law like merger and
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:17.040]   the fact that you can't copyright facts. So the basics of what he looked like in theory the question
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.200]   is he doesn't own his likeness. Not as a only only if it's used for commercial purposes that he
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.240]   doesn't go right. Well that's that's a completely separate thing that might be right a blisty type
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.200]   things. There's some really weird things that are happening now that we're starting to take
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:39.280]   inventory of how much we own about everything because of deep facts. Yeah. Well not just that.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.440]   I'm not necessarily a fan of this. The idea of like divvying up the whole world and that we own
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.040]   the whole world is this is not a model that will scale to accommodate everything we needed to
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.240]   accommodate. But but no he wouldn't have a copyright in his face. Now there is an open question
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:01.120]   sometimes with photography of the issue is who brought the originality to it. It's kind of generally
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.320]   presumed as the photographer but if the subjects in the picture basically position themselves,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:12.800]   stage themselves, direct the lighting like at some point the resulting photograph may not really be
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.000]   the original photographers. It might actually start to be the people in the photo. That's not
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.560]   generally presumed to be the case but but that is a thing that in theory it could happen and
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.120]   copyright would enable. But the other point I was getting to is you know there's a very factual
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:33.360]   basis and copyright law is supposed to resist somebody locking up the only way to speak something
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.760]   or the facts of something that that stuff is not supposed to be subject to copyright.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:43.200]   And with photography where you've got something that's so realism based. Because essentially
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:50.080]   what they're arguing got copied here was not the artistry that went into the original photograph
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.760]   but maybe just the essence of what his face looked like at that pose. And they didn't really discuss
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:03.200]   that but I wonder if they should have because they're really sort of saying that goldsmith so much
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.440]   of what you see was goldsmith's originality and that's maybe an assumption that needs to be tested.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.240]   But in theory that got tested at the lower courts and here they were just sort of kicking around
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.640]   what is the appropriate test that should have been used to look at those four factors and did the
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:23.360]   did the second circuit get that right. So we've spent half an hour talking about this. Why should
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.040]   we care? Would you like to continue to have free expression?
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.640]   Let's think about you and Mrs. LaPorte. Y'all go out and take photographs quite often.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.480]   Yes. Just for fun. Yes.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.400]   And let's say that you had the opportunity to recreate that Marilyn Monroe scene of her
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   making that pose and the thing blowing and you snap it and it turns out to be an amazing photograph
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.600]   that you captured of Mrs. LaPorte in that pose. All of a sudden you got somebody knocking on
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.720]   your door. Do you want that? I think I'd win that case but I don't want to have to spend the
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:10.240]   money to defend it. But I think Ant is making my argument like you've now in some way made a
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.200]   terrific work. Now you've made it in a different way than Warhol made this. There is the question
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:22.080]   that because he had access and it was it's complicated by he had licensed access to this specific
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.200]   original what does that mean for the purposes of the test but then the Warhol Foundation pointed
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.120]   out like well okay so you're mad that he used this particular image but how would it be better if
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.560]   he had just infringed on somebody else's image like that can't possibly be the solution. He needed
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:47.200]   something to make his his transformation. If I put a purple frock on Mona Lisa. Oh they had a Mona Lisa
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.040]   hypo during the hearing. They did actually give us the hypo. I'm trying to remember I remember
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:45:00.160]   just as Robert's but I can't remember what he said. But yeah I think it had to do with if you've
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:06.720]   taken the Mona, oh I think it was a Lido sorry. It was a Lido yeah. It was a Lido. If you take the
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.080]   Mona Lisa and you make a very he's like pretend that the Mona Lisa is still in copyright. If you
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:21.360]   take the Mona Lisa and you adapt it in some small way where the general public. Oh she's frozen. We may
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:28.640]   never know. So Leo I have it in a I actually have it in Lawrence. You have it. Okay. Hurley's
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   article. He is how I knew it. Just a Samuel Alito question how much court should defer to expert
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.440]   witnesses when deciding whether a work shows a different meaning. While an average person
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.520]   might view a copy of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa in which the subject wears a different colored dress.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.800]   An expert in Renaissance art would see it as transformative. Say well that you know there's no
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:02.320]   issue. It's not the Mona Lisa. You know Lido told one of the attorneys you make it sound simple but
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.960]   maybe it's not so simple at least in some cases to determine what is the meaning or message
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   of a work of art. I think actually this is these oral arguments are quite I'm going to listen to
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.960]   them when I get home because I think quite interesting. Another rest of your question is about protecting
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.920]   the public domain and what we can do with that. It's so important that the commons the creative
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.320]   commons are preserved because that's how that's where art comes from. No one creates in a vacuum.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   We got a couple of people on the money. No no stop. Oh sorry. Let Kathy finish. Sorry. The internet.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:46.560]   So the Mona Lisa Hypo was if it had to do with who is who's defining new meaning. So the hypo was
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.200]   that you've changed the Mona Lisa ever so slightly where most people don't notice that you have
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.240]   something new and different but to a Renaissance expert oh that difference is really striking and
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.280]   significant and they were questioning and the hypo was is that enough new meaning to to affect
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.600]   the analysis because one of the big one of the big sources of tension is how much does new meaning
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.520]   matter what's what's transformative. Yeah what does that mean. Yeah is it enough just to put a line on it.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   And is that relevant for the first factor test in particular like is that new meaning the argument
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.600]   that the Warhol Foundation was is that the second circuit really excluded the fact that there was
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:34.000]   new meaning in the in the subsequent work where they think that on that alone it was
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.560]   error to go back down to be rethought to say no you have to at least consider it but then there's
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.480]   still the question of consider it and then what how dispositive should it be and the the government
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.760]   and the photographer were arguing not very dispositive given all the other factors what is it doing to
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.480]   the market and ultimately what they were arguing about was purpose so you still got two pictures
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.280]   that are about prints and that's not different enough because they're both still serving the purpose
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.560]   of being pictures of of prints but the argument on the other side is but they are fulfilling a
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:10.160]   different purpose saying different things about prints and is that something that should really
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.040]   you know pass muster with the first factor. The other thing that they were also getting stuck on
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.320]   although it's maybe tangential to this is necessity how much did you need that original
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.800]   and they never they they got lost in that argument a lot and the government and the
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.160]   photographer seemed to be arguing that necessity really needs to be more important of like oh but
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.760]   you you have to improve that you really needed this picture in order to make the new statement
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.080]   you were trying to make and but I think that's really chilling in the Warhol
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.720]   argument the Warhol Foundation was arguing that of that of course you need it you would always
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.440]   need it you'd always need something and you know what do you mean that you'd have to prove that
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.760]   you know somehow prove in a defense that no no no this is really the thing and not some other
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.280]   picture that I could have used even though that other picture might be in copyright and then I
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.080]   just be infringing them and we'd be having that case so I think that's a bit of a red pairing.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.800]   Was the photographer in England Goldsmith in the courtroom?
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.600]   I was told yes but I don't know what she looks like so I can't quite confirm.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.120]   I mean she obviously she has an interested party she's a very interested party all right we're
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.480]   going to end this but that was the option I just mentioned one thing real quick real quick
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.840]   because I think you're always a funny person at Communia Association CO-N-U-N-I-A I put it on
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:31.520]   A4 has policy recommendations on copyright 14 of them which I think are very good because I think
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.280]   we basically part of what we're doing here is we're reconsidering the nature of copyright as a whole
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.000]   you know when it would have started it did not include news it did not include magazines it
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.960]   didn't include a lot of maps it didn't include a lot of things and how much it's been expanded
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:52.080]   not only in time but in scope it's worthwhile in a new age to reconsider the essence of it.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:58.000]   This is for the EU but particularly they have very different rules in the EU but I like this
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.640]   paragraph which says to defend and expand public domain protect and promote usage rights empower
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:14.400]   creators in their audiences and I think that's part of this is this tension between creators
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   who want to pull up the latter once they've created and new creators who want to come along and say
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.640]   we want to we want to we want to never really the creators what do I learn and research on
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.920]   owners is it yeah it was it was creating a tradable asset for the owners and that was always in
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:36.880]   fact that's a Corey's point in his choke point capitalism which is quite good is that copyright
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:43.360]   is used as a weapon against creators by people like the music publishers and the motion picture
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.960]   industry not the creators themselves. I don't think Ed Sheeran is really a fan of copyright at
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:54.560]   this point. I mean and quite frankly it's terrifying to be a songwriter in the Ninth Circuit like
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.520]   you're just you know you're just a heavy dumber. Mike I think we're a good post today. He actually
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   won the shape of you copyright case and was awarded 1.1 million in legal fees so that's
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.320]   not done he just got attacked again. Oh church today there's another post about it another one.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.760]   Yeah and then like somebody who wanted to have a look at sort of like the catalog doesn't have
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.640]   the value he thought I don't know it was such a second post interesting by Mike yeah.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:31.120]   All right let's take a little break when we come back Kathy if you want to stick around
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.200]   you're more than welcome to we're going to be talking about things like the pixel phone if
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.280]   if you want to get home do you got to take the reseller home or oh I know I'm just in a friend's
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.360]   office and as long as I can stay here and not get locked in I'm happy to stay here for a while.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.800]   We'd love to have you. Thank you. Our show today brought you.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.360]   It's a happy overnight. Yeah I will be overnight I promise you. I'm trying in fact I told
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.120]   the new Leo Jeff before the show we're going to try to get this thing down under two hours.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:02.000]   Sunday we did the longest Twitter ever I think it was three hours 24 minutes and so
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.760]   the hours 24 minutes or really hard now to take an hour off of that. Who was on?
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.760]   I don't know I was asleep through half of it. One to it down.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:17.440]   Thompson and Ben Parr. It was a great show actually but wow and that's my problem is when
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.320]   the conversation starts getting good I lose track of time and that's not a good thing so
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.520]   we're going to try to keep this one on schedule. Our show today brought to you by SecureWorks.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:35.600]   SecureWorks is a leader in cyber security building solutions for security experts by

[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.920]   awareness month month of October which means now would be a great time to raise awareness
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:58.320]   about digital security and empower everyone to protect their data from cyber crime. SecureWorks
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:04.480]   has the perfect solution. Now's the time to get their Tages XTR extended detection
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.960]   and response. In 2022 this year cyber crime and estimated will cost the world seven trillion
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:18.480]   dollars trillion with a T but it's not stopping. No by 2025 that figure will grow to 10 and a half
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.920]   trillion dollars. Last year ransomware as far as we know and I suspect these numbers are low
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:31.200]   total 20 billion dollars in damages attacks occurred every 11 seconds. By 2031 ransomware
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:37.360]   is expected to cost 265 billion dollars a year and strike every two seconds. I bet it'll be worse
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:44.480]   than that even. Make sure your organization is not the next victim with SecureWorks Tages XDR.

[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:55.120]   a free trial of Tages XDR secureworks.com/tuit secureworks defending every corner of cyberspace we thank
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:03.200]   them so much for supporting this week in Google. That was good we it was not Google but it wasn't
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.800]   on musk so it could go you know I mean it's exactly and it wasn't to have our person's stream court I know
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:15.680]   I love it. I got to talk about something else. I could bring up Elon Musk but it's gotten so
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:21.840]   horrifically horrible terrible no good very bad that I don't even it's ridiculous at this point
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:29.600]   it's ridiculous let's talk about something happier the new pixel 7 I ordered one it'll be coming
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.160]   tomorrow I'm sorry to say I wish I had it for you today the reviews start coming out I think when
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:41.760]   is the embargo lift chatroom I think somebody said tomorrow morning we'll start maybe today maybe
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:46.240]   we'll start seeing the pixel stuff yeah the pixel watch and I think I'm starting to see pixel watch
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.040]   reviews right yeah I started to see him yeah I think the watch reviews are out I'm not sure about
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.800]   this the the phone I have talked to somebody I guess I can say Andy Inako who has the pixel watch
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.720]   he's embargoed he can say he has it he can show it to us he did yesterday on Macbreak week we can
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:10.080]   hold us a phone it was lift this morning okay so I'll look for Andy's pictures he said I could tell
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:17.040]   you the pictures are incredible I can't show him to you yet so let me see if he's posted them on his
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.800]   Instagram because he was very now yeah he was very bullish about the images he was getting
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:28.160]   he has the main reason to consider getting it yeah I mean at this point otherwise it's a phone
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:34.400]   it's well actually I shouldn't say that because google unlike apple which really never talks about
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:40.640]   phones at the event on thursday spent a lot of time talking about the phone phone yeah you're right
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:48.480]   you know they have some new technologies which as far as we know will come down to the pixel six at
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:56.640]   least at some point as a feature update but they what do they call it clear clear talk clear
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:04.960]   clear tone they have some new features to make the sound quality better they have
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:10.800]   let's see let me see if I can find you know it's so funny because here's a review from nine to five
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:20.320]   google camera camera camera camera battery that matters with all phones yeah it is it really is
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:26.160]   but they I think they announced a number of really good phone features for the pixel seven
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.400]   um let me see if I can I didn't actually bookmark those let's see if I can find them
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:41.280]   uh small this was a thing smallness you and stacy both say they see his floppy you are smaller
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.560]   lighter i'm sorry like my hands are only so large and my pockets are only so large and I don't want
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.720]   a phone that I can't keep in my pocket and why it's the same pockets not getting any bigger you
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:57.600]   know miss cat the i hear that from queen pruit quite often but i also hear just as much oh i can't see
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:03.200]   the screen you know it looks it's sort of a i think it depends what you optimize for like i know
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   some people who are basically using it almost instead of their laptop and they're the people
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:13.280]   who want the bigger screens and they too handed and um they want to be able to see everything i want
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:19.040]   the emergency computer like i'll shut my laptop if i want a laptop but if i just want to be out and
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.960]   about but not disconnected i want something small and portable and um i'm not getting that i'm losing
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:30.400]   that over time although i did today just see my friend had a foldable one and i don't know if
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.040]   those are nice they're expensive and not quite make you ready yes stacy has the no i think it's
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.720]   quite good the samson flip four came out uh last month which way so dacey i sent her my flip three
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:46.480]   i think they're very very uh good i wouldn't get the fold which is the idea is it's a tablet that
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.640]   folds up into a rather thick phone but i would look at the flip phone which is especially if you
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:56.080]   want a smaller phone yeah it fit yeah the problem is they don't put big pockets in women's clothing
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.200]   actually well we're lucky to get any pocket you're lucky to have pockets yeah
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:05.440]   but you know like normal pants sort of we can get away with it but there's a limit to helping
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.320]   they're they're going to be and you don't want to put in your back pocket because that's where
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.360]   pick pockets target so i i am seeing reviews the verges review is out they give it a
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:22.480]   of score of seven uh they're there yeah they're not quite the super helpful ultra intelligent phones
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.360]   that google wants them to be this is allison johnson writing but the latest pixel devices are more
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.560]   competitive than ever i don't think you know i don't know if i care about whether they're
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.360]   competitive yeah it's also about the numbers of the expectation what do they expect yeah if it's
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:46.800]   g2 chip the new tensor g2 chip uh which google says uh because it's a ai focus chip is required for
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:53.280]   some of the features including the improved audio although i notice allison says uh when she's
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.000]   talking about the good and the bad that new speech and intelligence features are underwhelming
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.840]   uh it does have face recognition as well as fingerprint remember the fingerprint reader on
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.960]   the pixel six a lot of people complain about ant you hated it i remember i did it got better
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.720]   it got better over time i found it fine but uh it's totally fine it'll be nice to have a choice
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:23.200]   and to have uh you know fast fit on face unlock would be good um even with mask on that's another
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.080]   key yeah and iphone's done that for a while and it really works even when i wear my scary bane mask
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:35.600]   the iphone will unlock uh sometimes not always sometimes for me um let's see the screen is the
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:44.880]   same size uh 6.3 inch olet on the pixel 7 6.7 inch on the pixel 7 pro and it's 120 hertz display on
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:51.280]   the pro model 90 hertz on the little model i never pay attention to refresh rate but people really
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:57.040]   seem to notice the difference the smooth scrolling and so forth uh very bright by the way and every
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:04.800]   all the reviewers have said yeah they they really look good uh in the daylight um colors are softer
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.320]   says allison the camera bar is either oh she's talking about the camera bar which is now
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:18.640]   uh all metal matte and polished aluminum matte for the pixel 7 and the pro has you like you
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.600]   like the bar when you didn't bother me you get a what you're gonna do and you want is a case that
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.320]   makes the bar more flush because otherwise it does i mean without a case it really protrudes
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.120]   this is the pixel 6 but you could see how big that uh camera well they ever make a phone that doesn't
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.840]   need a case that's a stupid question but well everybody claims they've made a phone that doesn't
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:46.000]   need a case but they don't when you're making them at a glass try yeah my three fell on its face
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.800]   like you know the day i got it yeah hit something on just the right corner to send us
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.640]   blinter through it and it's been there ever since at least i've had the the um protective sticker
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.840]   over it so it didn't shatter further and it doesn't slice my fingers so it's just really really
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.040]   annoying that it exists but uh but i think i got a case on it that didn't have enough of a bevel
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.440]   um i think you want a cushion above the glass to be able to um you know feel like it could fall
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.560]   in its face without too much injury yeah i agree uh google didn't have problems as you remember
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:25.760]   last year with drop calls a lot of pixel 6s couldn't call 911 uh i don't know if they ever
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.680]   solved that google says it's using a new modem chip uh but the verge says uh she had a couple of
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.640]   issues on one call the person on the other and said the phone was cutting off the last syllables
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:43.520]   of her sentences another time caller said i got cut off as i was talking um that's unfortunate
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   yeah uh but that's you know one person's experience with a couple of calls as i said i'll have the
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:56.880]   phone tomorrow and i'll uh i'll report back next week um battery all google said is that last over
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:05.920]   24 hours lies yeah probably lies yeah probably lies the pro has a 5 000 milliamp hour battery
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:15.680]   which is fairly big that's big yeah 43 55 for the pixel 7 uh again you get so you know you even
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.040]   saw a different battery life depending on which version of android you were using right here
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.120]   i sure did this this the latest version man this battery is it's definitely all day there's no
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.160]   stress at the end of the day um what last week it was sitting at like 70 percent during the show
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.000]   uh it's 68 today yeah and i've been on it a good bit this morning because i was trying to work on
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.200]   some stuff with floss so yeah it's this it's way better now with the oas update good
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.960]   you know uh in in uh the years that google's been selling these uh phones how many years has
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:56.400]   been almost 10 uh they've sold a total of i think 27 million which is less than apple and samsung
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:03.200]   not saying more so they're just really not in the they're not i don't think they're important
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:09.760]   they're important because it's the phone from google but well again i go back to my argument
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.640]   the other week where people think of android phones they never think of google it's always
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.800]   samsung right and heck they never even say android they just say droid or they say samsung right
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.440]   right it's they don't know they don't even yeah so google has added something they call clear
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:34.080]   calling to filter out background noise and wind uh cnn in in their review says this is max
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:41.680]   bon dono says it works remarkably well i placed a lot of phone calls during my testing each one
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.240]   in a different setting so it's really funny the reviewers are getting you know results all over
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:52.000]   the map uh some walking down windy streets others at my kitchen table all of them were delightful
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.840]   since i could hear the person i was speaking with so clearly the other uh which was available
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:04.560]   last year on the pixel six direct my call which they showed off at the event and i tell you what
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.440]   if if it does it well it's the it's the one thing that would make it worth buying this phone
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   when you get to a call tree it shows you on the screen what the options are so you can tap them
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:23.200]   you don't have to sit and listen to please hold on as our options have changed press one they never
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:30.800]   have changed they never changed uh he says he couldn't test it because he couldn't find anybody
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:38.320]   participating apparently businesses have to make their voicemail compatible with google duplex
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:45.280]   before direct my call can work i think maybe a lot of businesses don't want you to skip ahead
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.920]   the whole point of the voice tree is to get you to hang up before they have to pay a human
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:59.040]   to talk to you because that's expensive so i'm not clear voice memos uh getting an improvement
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:04.800]   when you use the recorder app your phone will not only transcribe it but will label the speaker
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.880]   i don't i mean it wouldn't know it's you jeff maybe it would maybe say that that guy jeff
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:21.120]   hang up uh again cnn says it works exceptionally well to a point where it makes you wonder just
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:27.280]   how powerful google's machine learning software really is the good news is google has guaranteed
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:33.840]   three years of android versions and five years of security updates so that's a big improvement
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.160]   you know right before the we i think we talked about standard now is that like the apple standard
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:43.280]   to five years secure apples longer than that i think apple is longer i think apple now it's down
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.160]   to its iphone eight i think i can't remember you're getting the apple goes on a long time
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:54.640]   samson goes on five years i think it ought to be the standard right uh i think it's not unreasonable
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.600]   to think you'll get a new phone every five years right although i know plenty of people who don't
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.880]   i think most people probably don't how old was your phone john before you got the new iphone
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.040]   eight years jeez and he works for us
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:18.560]   i have a tectured post though complaining about that i couldn't run united airlines app
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.720]   on my phone anymore because something needed to be upgraded right i guess the operating system and
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.320]   the phone couldn't do it so it ended up unsupported and this just seemed like a problem that that at
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:36.240]   certain point the ecosystem if it's not breaking your devices it basically makes them unusable
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.520]   and some of the pushback is well because stuff needs to be supported and it's not supported so
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.320]   it will be unsafe but this is a problem because it just creates e-waste and right now we don't
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.840]   have a very robust rate of repair so the idea that you buy a thing and that like if you take care
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.280]   of it and if you don't drop it it has a finite life like it's a disposable product it's a disposable
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.160]   product with a lifetime of not weeks but years but it's only a handful of years whereas
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.240]   you know we used to buy washing machines and televisions that would last for like a generation
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:13.600]   this is not good yeah they don't last anymore here i'll get the ants opinion on this this is
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:22.160]   again max buldano writing for cnn here is an example of the zoom uh this is a 50 megapixel
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.520]   sensor with a 2x button so there's the put does and quotes there's yeah i know well it's
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.600]   bending and maybe have that many bag of pixels but who knows what you get i think that's a pretty
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.880]   good zoom that looks pretty good quality yeah it's a you know it's a little artifacted but not
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.640]   not bad the ultra wide is the same as on the six in fact honestly i don't think there's a lot of
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.320]   differences in the camera i'm more curious about the macro because i believe they have
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.440]   shortened the minimum focal yeah distance for macro yeah that's big for people that love to
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:04.880]   shoot macro shots you get even closer this is uh it might be a macro of a of a bagel
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.280]   it's looking pretty good makes me want a bagel i'll take it i'll take a bagel please with a
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:19.360]   ham and egg breakfast bagel the macro move ham and a bagel ham and a bagel now really that's not right
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:25.280]   is it Kathy that's that's not okay who put that trafe in my bagel exactly
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:37.600]   and gravy and gravy more pork uh new seven uh forty eight megapixel telephoto lens uh five x
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:46.320]   lossless zoom photos um the 12 megapixel mid middle camera do a 10x zoom and then you can do an op a
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:54.160]   uh a digital zoom up to 30x um macro mode lets you get closer than ever before or whatever that
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.320]   means i don't know how close doesn't say it wasn't very close when i did macro shots with this six pro
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:07.600]   i found it i got better image quality using the telephoto lens and standing further back and
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.320]   doing isn't that interesting on it yeah um yeah i believe we actually demoed it last year on the
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:21.360]   show i had coffee beans and just set up the light and put the phone on a little tripod stand and
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.840]   just use the telephoto and it was it was nice for a phone the macro mode was it you couldn't get
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.920]   tight enough little disappointing according to digital camera world there is no manual photo
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.480]   mode uh i don't know if you can get raw images um that's something apple does very well with
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.640]   their pro res or their pro raw they call it where you get a a raw dump of the data from the sensor
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.400]   but you also get included in the in the file which is very large as a result all the computational
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:01.200]   information the depth and image information and so forth um so that's good um obsidian
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:10.320]   lemongrass and snow i ordered snow oh i was hoping if you'd got the greenish winter is coming
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:21.440]   oh yes this was a big week for announcements so the pixel announcement uh was on um thursday
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.800]   they also announced the first time that google's ever released a watch the pixel watch and i have
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.720]   to say i'm not tempted to order it because the glass is like a bubble a curved bubble and time
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.760]   it's completely exposed and i just know the first time i'd get it be just like you catholic
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.320]   perfect right against something i'm more interested in the watch than the phone myself for the health
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:49.040]   reasons yeah uh although google has said that you don't with the watch you don't get uh the full
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:13:00.880]   fitbit um experience which is surprising since they own fitbit capitalism baby yeah yeah um
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.680]   so let me see if i can find a review of the watch since we're we're talking about it
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.640]   wonder if the shock has got his stuff out he was on all about android last night to shock
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:18.720]   Armstrong yeah and i know he had and they had yeah they had effective you're really interested in all
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.240]   this stuff probably better to watch all about android because they had they all had the phones
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.720]   they all had the watches they were all they were all talking google did announce kind of an
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.720]   interesting thing and i normally had put this in the changelog but i i think this is actually
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.320]   more important than just a changelog if you're a google fi user which i am and i ordered the
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:43.280]   phone from fi they are now going to turn on an anonymizing feature called virtual carrier network
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:52.000]   as you know google is an mvno fi uses us cellular and t-mobile but us cellular and t-mobile and
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.280]   google will not get information about who you are google which released a technical white paper
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:06.640]   said neither party is capable of associating traffic with any specific user the virtual carrier
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:15.440]   network keeps your cellular data anonymous on pixel devices anonymous from both google and t-mobile
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.240]   and u of s cellular the mvno's um that's very i thought very interesting
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.480]   so if you're worried about your carrier we know that carriers are notorious for snoopin on people
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:38.080]   i think that's sort of an expectation right that they will yeah yeah it sounds a little bit like a
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:45.360]   vpn uh the vcn encrypts all internet bound traffic using ipsec tunnels so it is kind of a vpm aes
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:53.600]   c gcm uh there are also carrier network level components by contract so they've contracted
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:01.840]   with the mvno's not do you won't do not do not snoop the uh fi vcn uses blind signing to assure
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.040]   full separation of your identity from your network traffic so you can authenticate that a user has
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.840]   a validify subscription and therefore can be granted access to the vcn service but no metadata
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.560]   regarding the content of internet traffic and internet services being used are tied back to you
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:26.320]   as an individual subscriber i think that's good google you know one of the problems google has
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.680]   competing with both samsung and apple is i think most people don't think of google as the privacy
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:39.200]   company no to say the least right right this company sells ads we search and stuff they want
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:46.400]   everything people know what their business data yeah i'm excited to i will try this google is rolling
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:54.400]   out passkey as well uh on these new devices passkey you may remember is the uh technology that's
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.840]   supposed to eliminate uh passwords this should also be in the changelog but i think it's so important
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.360]   i'm moving it up uh apple google and microsoft have agreed to replace website passwords and apt
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:15.200]   passwords too with pass keys the device when you unlock it by with biometrics or an id verifies
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:21.680]   your identity and that's enough so starting today android and google chrome will support
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:28.720]   signing in with pass keys well that so it does not already work to some extent i mean if if it's
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.000]   already set up somewhere else to recognize that i'm not well no it has to be supported by the tool
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.560]   the phone because the phone has to authenticate you so this part of that phytost stuff mr loport
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.160]   yes it's phytosto that's what it is phytosto does the service i'm trying to get into have to
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.280]   set that up first yes so yes okay so i'm going to find out you go to strava to log in because i
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:58.480]   know you're a big runner jeff and uh you go to strava to log in and instead of uh instead of
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:07.280]   seeing uh a standard log in here's the image from uh from google uh it says use your screen lock
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:15.280]   it says use this pass key and it says uh you know uh jeff javis and you say yes and then it says
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   unlock your screen they show a fingerprint although face id would work as well uh if you are on a
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.880]   browser that it and not on your device so let's say you're on a browser on your chrome book it'll
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.720]   pop up a qr code you pull out your phone you scan the qr code on the phone the phone says okay
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:39.680]   identify yourself and you're in no the phone is your unlock uh this is a you know they're a
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.480]   pros and cons to this system but it's sure better than sure beats passwords if you want to use it
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:50.080]   you'll have to enroll in the google play services beta and use chrome canary stable launch will
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.640]   come later this year which means in the next couple of months because this year is almost uh all right
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:03.280]   developers can build passkey support on the web with chrome by the web authn api so you're you're
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:09.600]   gonna have to find sites that will support this i think now that apple's supporting it in ios 16
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:16.400]   google's supporting it on android uh i think that's you know it's the catch 22 it's the chicken
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:22.240]   or egg problem and i think now sites will start to uh implement it so that's very good news passkey
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:32.160]   is it's coming out in an attempt to help curtail a lot of the password breach stuff right basically
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:37.360]   is what this is doing yeah yeah it would it would solve the fishing problem i think fishing estimate
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.520]   fishing yeah uh and so that was another oh i think you put something else in there which
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:51.040]   was really interesting yeah if if if if someone loses their phone a homeless person loses their
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.800]   phone you had that in the rundown oh this is a yeah okay so that was a long tweet uh thread from
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:04.640]   Chad loader who um is a journalist google's project a product designer should talk to my
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:11.040]   unhoused friends yeah this is a you know this is an example of you know an employed engineer
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.200]   doesn't really consider these issues when you require a mobile phone number for authentication
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:23.760]   as many sites as now we're going to a more so yeah i guess you're right pass keys would require
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:28.960]   mobile that's that's yeah not something ridiculous uh you you guaranteed that an unhoused person will
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.000]   permanently lose access to their email when their phone is lost stolen or destroyed and if you're
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.920]   unhoused that happens a lot right it happens all the time unhoused people tend to get their phones
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.120]   through obama phone program which means replacing a lost or stolen phone results in a completely new
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:51.040]   phone number service providers and caseworkers rely on email to communicate with unhoused folks
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:56.560]   i've got about 30 unhoused neighbors whom i regularly communicate with now the single one has been
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:01.040]   able to keep the same cell phone number for more than four months at a time it's usually four weeks
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.960]   or less tech space two factor means they permanently lose access to their email accounts
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:14.400]   uh they're often going to the library to do that um they they can't they they have to get a new
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.520]   gmail account each time in your casework or close your case for non-response then you have to start
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:26.880]   all over again yeah uh i thought i didn't see that threat you know it occurred to me this is a
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:36.080]   dumb idea i mean couldn't google give every unhoused person an email address that they that they then have
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:43.120]   or a phone number or something that they then have across devices or across well yes he he raises
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.440]   the thing uh the issue of google voice for the people wondering whether google voice would help
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.920]   the answer is no because to use google voice you have to log into a google account all right yeah
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.360]   and uh you know it's a chicken and egg problem but google could solve this absolutely and that's
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.880]   what he's saying he's saying uh employees of bay area tech giants are probably the last people
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.480]   a group of people on earth i'd trust to design products that work well for unhoused users so i mean
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.680]   it has to do with the myopia of design right of well you think about it in terms of your life
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.400]   as you understand it and you don't consider other use cases and this is also where diversity becomes
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.360]   sort of the watch word where the more people you have the more people it's going to different
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.080]   use cases will dawn on because they have different lived experiences so they'll be more sensitive to
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:38.400]   it um so there's a lot of things going on this particular problem needs a better process to solve
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.800]   it but then there's the sort of the larger thing of like well why didn't it get anticipated in the
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.720]   first place and sometimes you know you can't think of everything but there do seems to be
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.360]   not infrequently shortcomings like this where you just really didn't think through who your entire
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.800]   constituency was and even if you aren't a diverse workforce you can certainly go through the uh
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.040]   brainstorming effort to do a little bit better and make sure you don't just you know consider the
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.200]   world is you know whatever you see at the end of your nose that there's more to it than that and
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.400]   you need to think harder about different cases and also in terms of like okay what are we
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:18.240]   presuming will all be in place and all work properly and what are the challenges what if all of those
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.040]   assumptions aren't met what if the person doesn't have dexterity what if the person can't read what
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.600]   if the person this or that i don't think they're going through the exercise of thinking that through
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   and maybe they think it's just not important because it's just not enough people but it is enough
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.280]   people that somebody needs to care it's also why it's such a vicious cycle homelessness is so
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.400]   hard to get out of because you've now you're kind of just you know you're cast adrift
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:50.160]   um and you know there is this kind of myopia anyway everybody we all experience this from time
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.880]   and time where they just assume you must have access to a computer right you must have a smartphone
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.640]   what you don't you don't have a smartphone what's wrong with you so older people also suffer from
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:07.200]   this uh this is a huge problem older people and i've been sort of being introduced to the problem
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:14.880]   of older people and cybersecurity and the challenges of that and you know we already have limp systems
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:21.600]   to sort of deal with cybersecurity anyway but when it comes to older people the breakdowns are really
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:26.320]   significant and then you get things where in order to preserve the privacy and preserve the
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.080]   cybersecurity maybe now you've got issues where effectively the person can't be in touch with
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.800]   their doctor anymore the communications are totally protected but they're so well protected
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.480]   that the patient can't get in that's right um we're not thinking this i mean some of these are
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.600]   truly hard problems but it's one thing to be stymied by a hard problem it's another thing to just
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.480]   never have assessed it correctly as a hard problem and i think we're there as opposed to truly
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.040]   mixed i mean because things are complex i agree a hundred percent it's a design issue it's just an
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   awareness issue it's solvable uh are you ready for the metaverse no no another
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:13.120]   i was i was 100 percent actually can you define the metaverse i know i cannot define the metaverse
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:20.160]   but at least now thanks to uh meta we have legs in the metaverse who in the place that we can't define
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.720]   what a what a what a release kicking up my heels uh how big are the pockets on the pants and the
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.760]   metaverse ah that's a that's a good question so uh not big enough to carry your head so
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.360]   pockets they didn't give her pockets only he gets a pocket but no pockets on those jeans
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:45.600]   she's just happy to be wearing heels baby that is a very sexist image i mean i want to choose
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.640]   that more power to them but that is not the devolved choice like some women actually like to be
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.400]   comfortable in their footwear yeah in fact not some all of us would like to be comfortable there
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:05.680]   here's uh well what happened uh they seem to have taken the image out of this uh tweet there was an
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:11.360]   image of them jumping for joy that they had legs maybe there was there maybe they're embarrassed i
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:19.120]   don't say somebody came out of that you know maybe that's not the best uh the best look so
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:27.760]   met so facebook had its facebook connect i'm sorry meta meta connect event uh yesterday i did not
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:34.880]   we we thought about covering it and i guess this is where my bias against uh meta shows up because i
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.720]   said no way i'm getting up tomorrow for uh microsoft i'm not going to do it it and you know there was
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.400]   some interesting stuff although it was a pretty soparific event i watched the video
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:51.360]   later what was interesting is for today's surface event microsoft panos pene showed a
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.760]   bunch of new surfaces and said uh such a nadela our ceo will be talking later in the day but for
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:04.880]   the meta event marx ukaberg says and now here i have such a nadela the ceo microsoft showed up for
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:11.440]   the facebook event not for his own surface event interesting like the plural of surfaces should be
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:20.800]   surfy surfasai how about that surfy um i won't even go into the surface stuff from today you can
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:27.120]   we we streamed it i got up seven a.m to do that actually didn't get up i got on the air at seven a.m to do
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:34.640]   that and it was uh singularly uninteresting although um there were some surprises for instance
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:42.880]   microsoft is going to build in dali 2 into its microsoft designer program which is their
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:50.160]   competitor for figma and canva and into bing search so soon you'll be able to do a bing search for
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:56.640]   an image that doesn't exist and dali 2 will create it just for you wow that was really surprising i
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.600]   thought that was quite interesting anyway back to uh the metaverse i know we're you're trying to
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:08.000]   avoid it but no now now you can walk back on your new metaverse i gotta talk about a lawn musk
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:22.400]   so um there were quite a few uh creepy uh memes about about legs in the metaverse but i can't i
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.760]   can't find the uh i put it on the chat did you the chat do you found it okay good i don't know
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:34.320]   it's on my list it wasn't if you go down to my list it's also online here we go don't tell me no
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:41.760]   lines i got no lines for you uh here we go legs coming soon are you excited boy marxure is and
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:47.680]   what's really sad about this image uh the people in the background there like yeah all
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:54.160]   are like jumping up and down on their torsos to cheer the fact that marx and this woman had
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.160]   wider legs so much harder than underprivileged here i think legs are harder because they don't
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.400]   know where your feet are they've got to interact with the surface yeah notice they're cutting them
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:14.160]   off um i don't know why legs are so hard but apparently they are i did order the uh the new uh
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:24.800]   sixteen hundred dollars she's um oculus uh pro these uh this oculus uh or sorry meta quest pro
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.200]   sorry they got rid of oculus didn't they um is they really didn't really talk about gaming at all
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.440]   this looks like it's really a productivity tool in fact that's why sachin and della showed up to
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:40.720]   show that this is a weird part with the it's supposed to be comfortable i guess is what they're
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.920]   trying to say uh sachin and della showed up to talk about their deal with microsoft to put wind
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.120]   put you know i have windows in the in the metaverse and uh microsoft office in the metaverse
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.880]   the only reason i ordered this is a i want to give them a chance because uh every five years i
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:03.760]   should i feel like i should try this stuff and b i can return it in 30 days so i'll try it they
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.960]   really focused on it as a productivity tool and i wonder is that if that's something people really
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.240]   you're looking that's i think i think benedict evidence was making or somebody was making that
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:18.880]   argument that it's it's oddly this will work more for first for enterprise than it's like google
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.400]   glass that's who they're aiming at yeah and an individual and i god if i had to go to a
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.840]   faculty meeting this way it'd be oh god ben tomsons i don't know anybody who wants to meet that way
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.080]   but nobody wants to meet anyway right this is uh zoom is already hard enough right
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.120]   yeah and uh you don't have legs on zoom let me cope okay mary chofoli pointed out
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:47.520]   that you're holding these controllers so how are you how are you supposed to type and
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:55.280]   it's just here's a teacher working Ben Thompson's tech read pointed out that they had been having
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:02.080]   meetings with the quest to until one of the people uh lost his quest to in a move and then they
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:07.120]   went back to zoom but he's he says they're kind of excited about using this uh quest pro
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.480]   for meetings he says you forget where you are
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:21.440]   uh but i think in most people agree that this is more a kind of a product demo than the future
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:29.120]   of meta but marx zugberg's betting on it as the future meta everything i read about it is
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.040]   it sounds like he's really trying to present something the way
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:39.120]   uh ready player one was where it takes you away yeah you know this is the life but
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.800]   is that really feasible on a on a mass scale do you think this is something everybody's going
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.840]   to get into is it just going to be niche down to the enterprise or the few people that got it
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.880]   you know several hundred bucks to just sort of throw away i just don't see it being feasible i
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:01.600]   don't either i read i just don't see the desire of the need i think the same product builders who
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:06.640]   didn't bother to think through the actual needs of their users may not have bothered to really
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.680]   think through the actual wants and desires and needs of their potential customers like i think
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.760]   the same we're not paying attention to all the people we really want to sell our stuff to
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.920]   and we're going to build from any way and sure they're going to like it because we're
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:25.040]   we're this company i think that's hopelessly naive and at some point when when customers have
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.920]   the power to say no they're going to say no and not rating that seven hundred dollar check is an
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:36.320]   easy no yeah i think you're going to it's not food from an entertainment standpoint i could see
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.640]   it being quite fun and people really diving into that but something that you're doing all day long
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.520]   and like like this is your life you get out of bed you brush your teeth wash your face you put your
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:54.320]   visor on and you start your day i don't i don't see that myself so cashmere hill did a did a
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:00.720]   i think brave piece and to do 24 hours in the net averse you know get different hour of the day
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.360]   and then the funny thing was there was a follow-up for the new york times
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:10.480]   uh in which evidently i think zuckerberg or somebody high up in in facebook scolded the staff of
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:16.400]   facebook uh for some of them aren't in uh what what do they call their workspace horizon world
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.200]   because it's so lucky they don't want to use it and they don't have they don't even have headsets
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:26.080]   and they don't want to be there and that's that's to Kathy's point if you're not eating the dog food
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.760]   don't give it to a dog yeah yeah uh we should point out cashmere hill was using the quest to the
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.800]   inexpensive relatively expensive yeah four hundred dollar vr headset which a lot of people like it's
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:43.760]   untethered and uh and the pro will be even uh better you know a lot more technology although battery life
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:49.600]   is between one and two hours so you ain't gonna be spent in 24 hours in the metaverse so she had
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:56.960]   to do an hour at a time yeah uh i i i got it because i thought really you know i ought to give it a
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:02.640]   chance and we're gonna get uh i think uh jason snell is gonna come in he's a big quest to user he
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:09.200]   likes it and uh gary kofler who's one of our listeners and has been in vr since it was you know first
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:15.920]   conceived of 25 years ago is has ordered his so we'll do a demo it comes in two weeks uh
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:22.880]   october 25th i know what gary thinks gary's all in i mean he's he's been but see he's he's one of
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:28.720]   those people who says it's gonna happen and i'm just i'm i'm watching as we get closer and closer he
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:35.760]   believes in the metaverse uh vision yeah i'm i'm not convinced people want to be in a metaverse but
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.680]   you never know till is there any use case aunt and Kathy is there any use case where you'd imagine
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:48.560]   yes for that purpose i want it i go back to just the exploring the world purpose of it you know i
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.960]   have mr the port's old oculus sitting right over there and hopping on google maps to see different
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:02.320]   parts of the world is so freaking cool you know and being able to use that tool to talk queen prude
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:09.520]   i'd have wanted to go to rio was awesome i had to tell because she said i want to go to rio vacation
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.360]   i'm like no you don't no you don't and i showed her the favelas and uh yeah we haven't talked about
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:21.040]   rio since how long ago was the last time you used the headset uh it's been a year at least
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.760]   well hang around you might inherit the new one
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.720]   kathie can you imagine i really i really do like it's one of those things where you go this is cool
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:38.080]   i get it but but i don't want to spend a lot of time in it so it's quadrific yeah
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:45.520]   do you put um and and i'm not trying to disparage anyone before i say this but are would you put
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:52.640]   the vr fans or not vr the metaverse fans in the same bucket you would put those that are all in on
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.680]   the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency no no no i don't think it's as scammy as that um
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:05.040]   no i i always suspect people who are flogging nft's and crypto and blockchain have a dog in that
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.080]   hunt like they're creating a market or something they want to unload on you uh doesn't blockchain
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:17.280]   have an an actual place in the world of technology far is just and here's how i here's how i put it
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:25.600]   blockchain is just a distributed database uh huh does a distributed database have a place in the
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:36.000]   future sure for some things yeah panacea okay yeah it's like everybody got all excited over
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.440]   mongo DB and wow this is an ex big thing it's it's a technology it's a legit technology there's
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:50.000]   some uses for it it's not going to change the world though okay it's a distributed database
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.320]   i think the answer to answer original question though i might want to say yes and i understand why
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:03.360]   why we'd say no because there definitely is a grift that shows up in a lot of the bitcoin things
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.720]   but i think some of the people who are buying into it are buying into it in a similar way that
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.520]   they're buying into the metaverse which is that there's something that they like buying into and
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:19.200]   the sense of community that buying into it and having shared compadres seems to scratch it some
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.160]   sort of emotional itch where the more they double down and the more they get people involved in
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.720]   the more they seem to have like a little family with an equally intense uh feeling towards it
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.960]   i think that does kind of bind people to certain things but i think it's not just bitcoin and i
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:40.480]   think it's not just metaverse i think it's also conspiracy theories and fan clubs and you know
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.680]   a lot of a lot of things that like people like to sort of feel like they've got their family like
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:51.680]   outside their literal family like um a place where things make sense to them they can commit it makes
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:58.480]   them happy they find pleasure they find support um and somehow i think you know i think something's
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.080]   deliver on some of that much better than others i don't think bitcoin is but i think that intensity
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.560]   of interest is something that is common across lots of things that people can be intensely
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:14.320]   interested in and feel very invested in and then feel that that investment needs to be defended
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.760]   because if it gets attacked then it's actually it somehow seems like more of an attack on them
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.800]   and their essence as opposed to you know that the interest is that's what solidifies the cult
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:30.240]   is when it's us us and them yeah yeah i mean to varying degrees and to varying degrees of detriment
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.960]   depending on what the thing is but um yeah i i think i think i share what inspired ants question
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.480]   which is it does feel like the same thing of like you're very intensely invested in something that
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.560]   may not be worth it and that may be true for bitcoin and also for metaverse i kind of liken it to
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:54.560]   andrew yang's quest for a universal basic income for a lot of people it's motivated
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:04.320]   by a very real issue which is you know late stage capitalism is falling apart income inequality
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.320]   is racing out of control there is no longer a middle class people cannot make enough money
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:20.720]   to support themselves in most jobs um you know we're we're in a situation where the rich get richer
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:28.800]   the poor get poorer we have a country falling apart over politics we've got racism
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   you know there's all these problems and people kind of say well here's a here's a path to privacy
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.920]   and equality by decentralizing money and i think for a lot of people
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:50.720]   um you know um jz is is trying to promote you know bitcoin awareness uh in the ghetto right
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:57.760]   and i think that's motivated not because jz's greedy but i hope there's more along the lines of
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:03.920]   just educating people well and even more he he wants to solve what is obviously a big problem
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.800]   you know i mean uh black people historically have just been left out of wealth creation
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:15.440]   uh you know uh for 200 years and so there's this huge and i mean the the income and inequality you
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:23.040]   see in general is ten times worse uh for black people and other people of color so i i understand
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.840]   that a lot of these people are motivated very positively just like andrew yang is
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:34.400]   with universal basic income by trying to solve this really bad problem i don't think either of them
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:40.480]   are is going to solve it and unfortunately there are a lot of scammers when it comes to crypto
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.120]   i mean you just see and and the hacks that are going on and you know binance just was hacked
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.120]   i'm half a billion dollars grief you know it's it's not it's it's
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:59.280]   painterly not the solution to wealth inequality privacy or anything else so unfortunately so i
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:06.160]   don't want to paint everybody who's into this or web 3 uh you know as being uh scammers or not i
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:12.320]   think they're motivated by genuine interest in fixing a terrible thing that's going on in this
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.280]   country i don't know how you fix it but i don't think defi is going to do that
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:26.880]   um and i guess metaverse isn't going to either you know i'm sitting there thinking about that whole
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.840]   the was ready player one thinking about that movie or the book or whatever
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:39.840]   what i did enjoy about it was it was everybody that had access to that space it wasn't just the
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.200]   rich that had access to but don't and don't forget what that world was outside the metaverse
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:55.040]   it was a horrific dystopia right yeah it was yeah and uh and i have to point out how did this guy
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.280]   living in what is he living in a container
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:03.600]   department building made out of containers or something how does he afford
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.360]   uh all this expensive gear right and even in the book there is this kind of issue where he has
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.600]   kind of worst gear and then he gets better gear and stuff but meta's spending 10 billion
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:23.040]   dollars a year to build this the the current high-end oculate uh or request pro is $1,700
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.240]   and uh it's not even the use case isn't there and well i mean i guess it isn't there you know i
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:36.400]   think we have to if we're gonna have a metaverse it's gonna have to be a ui much farther advanced
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.040]   than anything we're looking at right now hey here's well let's take a break and then i want to talk
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:48.240]   uh about the return of steve jobs he's talking to joe rogan or as they say bro jogan it just
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:56.080]   just a little bit but first hey it's great to have kathy gels stopping by uh after her appearance
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:02.480]   today at the supreme court i like to say that it's that it it it it it it it it it it it it it
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:07.280]   i i appeared at the building yes but usually appearance has to the slightly different
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:13.600]   country you went in didn't you i appeared in the gallery yes to watch the oral argument i'd love to
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.360]   do that that sort of appearance yeah and you're right i mean that's a rare experience for somebody
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:23.120]   to actually see these godlike figures in person and be reminded of they're just human beings i think
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:29.840]   is well you you can do this it's difficult because there's not that much seating i was on a different
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.560]   line because i was on the supreme court bar line um in a theory were special but they only let 19
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:39.840]   of us in as opposed to an unlimited number how many public get it how many of them get it i don't
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.080]   know how many and i also don't know if it's different now than it because we still are in
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.960]   there's still covid so um i don't know if they didn't stuff it as full as they normally would have
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:54.480]   stuffed the room but they did let members of the public so if the public wants to go they can go
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.880]   they just have to you know be aggressive about their line standing and get their early if you know
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.440]   there's if there's a hearing they really want to see but if they just want to see one some of them
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.560]   aren't all that interesting or popular the public in which case it's going to be much easier to get
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:15.760]   in um but certain cases well hearing no this one went very long this one had um i mean i think the
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.000]   original argument by warhol would might have gone for 50 minutes and then there was the other
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.320]   side and then there was the government and then there was rebuttal um and the next case was about
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.840]   oil so i just the recording is an hour and 42 minutes long the supreme court has two lines for
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.560]   the public uh first come first serve one is for those who wish to intend the entire argument
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.240]   the other is a three-minute line for people who want to just go in for three minutes there
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:49.680]   just just just to see it see that's not the same as the public line well that the public can do that
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.000]   but the public can also go in for the full thing as long as they get in for one of the allocated
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:00.720]   seats but that web page uh i do not think is reflecting the current reality of this particular
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.760]   opening for the public because there was nothing to alert you that it was limited for supreme court
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:12.080]   bar whereas in the past it had not been so um or it not been nearly so limited so your mileage may
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.720]   vary you know as somebody who knows but um yeah do it if you're in the member of the public in your
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.080]   curious the courts should be accessible to the public in theory now they're open for for view
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.840]   in-person viewing so avail yourself of the opportunity if you're in dc uh supreme court.gov
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.400]   if they don't allow people in they really should fix the website
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:38.240]   i mean they do allow people in but i think the regimen of how they're doing oh wait a minute says
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.480]   the three-minute line it says the three-minute line is temporarily suspended
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:49.040]   okay we didn't see anything yeah uh the building will otherwise be closed to the public to further
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.200]   notice so yeah there's also security there a little concern oh there's a lot of security yeah
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.160]   especially now right and then when we left we were allowed to leave but they really didn't even like
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.560]   us doggling on the steps that the steps were still closed off they didn't have the big garish
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.480]   gate but nobody could walk on the steps you had to stay on the sidewalk yeah anyway we're thrilled
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.680]   to have you Kathy thank you for filling in stasis is going to take a rushing in to uh to do this thank
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:22.480]   you stasis is going to take a couple of uh weeks off next week uh i'm thrilled the glenn
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:28.560]   fleshman will be stopping by ant you have the week off next week as well right yes sir okay so
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:34.560]   it'll be uh jeff me and glenn just consider yourself for a warrant we will be talking about next week
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:42.320]   yeah a lot of a lot of fun press stuff flongs you get the idea he's just well he just uh glenn was
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:50.480]   just uh he went to ojio to do uh research i just saw this on twitter in a comic museum so he's
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:57.440]   gonna be all all flonged up you know flonged up and is that exciting and then the week following
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.200]   we were talking a couple of weeks ago you would have been uh jeff hanging with uh mike maznick
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:14.240]   and he showed you a new kind of twitter clone called was it promissive planetary planetary
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.280]   that's it and uh well as you're talking about it the creative planetary
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.600]   rabble sent me an email saying big fan of the show was listening i said well this is the greatest
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:32.320]   why don't you come on we we would love uh to get your evan henchah plast not only
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:39.680]   is he doing this he worked at twitter he's very up on what twitter blue is all about oh i can't
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:45.760]   wait yes and he says planetary is intended to interoperate with twitter blue so you know
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.200]   because i had asked him well why why do planetary blue sky you be blue sky yeah why do planet not blue
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:58.000]   there's a different thing uh why do uh um planetary you know uh while there's mastodon and other
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.480]   things and so he has some very good arguments for it so i've invited him to be on he also
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:07.600]   before twitter he was at odeo which was eva william startup that was supposed to be a
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.120]   podcast uh directory so he has uh he has tales to tell yeah really looking forward to uh well

[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:42.080]   sloppy wrists and hobblin toes or woman i she she apparently apparently has a tendency to break
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:47.360]   her little toe and uh she said i hadn't done it what in four months and now i did it again so
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:53.520]   i had no idea uh no wonder she's got floppy wrists i think it's all tender toes and tender toes
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:58.480]   floppy wrists and tender toes so uh so we do have but we have a lot of stuff kevin marks will also
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.560]   join us next week so that should be fun jeff glenn and kevin next week jeff aunt and uh rabble
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.960]   uh the week after can't wait and and glenn's been advising me on fonts for my book so oh
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:16.640]   really geek out you get to choose your font i'm i'm discussing that there's some great font
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:22.480]   stories magnificent fonts oh i think special if kevin allows us i think we should delve into that
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.040]   next week that sounds great i look forward to it adds like a
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:34.640]   kind of one for that when i'm missing that one guys it's not as great as i'm i will be watching
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:40.720]   that because i find fonts fascinating i agree oh you know good it's great the use case of different
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.320]   fonts is that it really does go a long way in marketing and just presentation in general i
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.240]   want to tell the story of the doves bible font and it's an amazing story and glenn can tell it he's
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:56.320]   seen he's he's talked to the guy who's done amazing things with it it's phenomenal story
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:04.000]   i can't wait even for a fount of font knowledge next week sometimes spelled fount by the way but
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.520]   font is sometimes spelled fount yes and is it no doubt sometimes spelled font
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:17.920]   is a font a victim of a font and by the way a typeface is different from a font but we can do
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:26.960]   that next week a little tease to get excited wait can't wait till next week we can talk about the
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.760]   font that got somebody jailed by hitler you do that oh there's actually yeah i mean there's
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.040]   i don't know why but font nerds have lots of interesting things that are lacking
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:42.640]   there's there's sex and intrigue and all kinds of things around fonts it's amazing wasn't there
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:46.720]   uh i think you talked about last time the guy who threw his font in the ocean that's that's that's
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:53.440]   the dubs right that's the dub by the tens yeah the tens yeah our show today brought to you by cash

[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:58.320]   Let's see okay we're at the hour 51 mark I'm trying to keep my promise to myself
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:08.320]   to keep this show short what sort of turd yeah short yeah it's already too long to be short
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:19.440]   reasonable goals yeah I'm sorry I didn't have time to make you a short show I had to make you a long
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:26.240]   show I don't know to really screw up a quote from Mark Twain yeah if if you had time you'd have
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:34.240]   made this a shorter show or something it was witty in my head just yeah I know I know I know
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:42.240]   I know I should have been there in your metaverse you're talking about um pick something Jeff
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.080]   since uh you are there wasn't actually that much this week this was funny all right well let me do
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:52.240]   the Joe uh or the bro bro joke hold on hold on we can get something well I know that's what I'll do
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:59.200]   this one and you look while I'm all I'm doing this so there's a new podcast in town podcast.ai
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:08.000]   which they say is entirely generated by artificial intelligence and in this case the first very
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:15.040]   first episode using um voice technology by play.HT which I think owns this podcast they did an
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:23.040]   interview with Joe Rogan or as they call him bro Jogan and a guy that they wouldn't say without
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.720]   further ado it's been a long time let me go here let me go back that guy whose name he wouldn't say
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:36.080]   so without further ado my friend who's difficult to describe and wonderful and I'm so
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:40.880]   gratefully came on the show how's it going good to see you buddy it's been a long time since I've
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.560]   been on the show I've missed this it's always fun how's it going come on tell me about jobs
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.000]   these are uh a it's always good to see you buddy doing it so happy you came on man
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.640]   yeah it's great to be on the show your audience is just so different from your normal apple users
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:06.400]   and that's a good thing it's cool well you know I was an apple user way before I did this show
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:12.720]   I've been a fan of yours in Macintosh since the 1980s well the latter is a little unnerving
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.960]   unnerving apple is big it's still like the voices are exactly right users think people who listen
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.960]   to your show are a different group they're weird well that's good so you must be a fan of the show
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.920]   then right I am I am a fan I mean it's nice to sit back in the car and listen to you ran
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:38.720]   I've always liked you well uh appreciate that any this is weird time all right all stop
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.560]   a little freaky but uh you know we're I mean look obviously it's not there yet but with
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.080]   it's getting there and I think more and more um it's just a matter of time before you won't be
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:55.840]   able to tell the difference between the real Joe Rogan and the real bro Jogan and to bring back
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.640]   somebody from the dead the if you listen the whole 19 minutes there are lots of quotes that I
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.720]   recognize that Steve said so I think the AI was trying I'm not sure how they did this but I think
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:15.680]   the AI was trained on actual Steve Jobs quotes and actual Steve Jobs audio play that ht which does
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:22.640]   the podcast has a whole bunch of voices so obviously this is basically an ad for their
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:30.080]   capabilities but I'm gonna keep listening to what I have online 56 all righty
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:40.720]   scooglers who started character.ai in which in text you're talking with um a chat characters
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:50.240]   like Elon Musk oh just what I wanted hook that into the other AI and you have a made up Elon
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:57.200]   with made up Elon's voice talking to a made up g from China I think we're I think we're a few years
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:07.600]   away from you know we'll be doing a story in a few years where um I don't know uh we won't know if
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:15.600]   we're listening to an actual interview with somebody here's Alex Wilhelm a little conversation he had
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:23.680]   with ship AI. Weapons are online there are several on the ship plasma cannons rail guns
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:28.640]   particle accelerators energy shields and several different types of missiles the ship has several
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:33.520]   defense systems to protect it from a variety of threats to which Alex Wilhelm says are there any
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:41.200]   threats nearby as we warm up for faster than light travel ship AI says there are two ships nearby a
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.400]   small freighter and a large battleship I have detected the possibility that they will follow us
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:51.760]   into light speed if they see us leaving and I have a few other ships I'm keeping close tabs on this
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:59.680]   kind of cool he's actually creating a like a science fiction novel okay says Alex please fire plasma
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:04.960]   guns and the particle accelerators is the small freighter before we engage faster than light travel
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:11.280]   plasma cannons and particle accelerators fired the freighter has been heavily damaged
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:16.960]   however the larger battleship has now targeted us with its rail guns I have sent it a stress
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:24.240]   speaking as the hyperdrive still has 43 seconds to come online this is awesome this is awesome you
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:36.400]   could be in Star Trek no no no I agree with you have okay when you brought up the rogue and thing I
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:43.520]   thought it was something else will sasso is a comedian another comedian yeah he started up a
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:50.560]   podcast I just had to look it back up it's called dude see and it's basically using AI to help
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:55.680]   pretty much produce the show where they allowed an AI to go through their personal emails text
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:01.120]   messages and social media accounts purchases and browse in history so that it can tailor to show
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.240]   to their specific oh that's interesting and entertain you I've not listened to this to any of
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:14.320]   this yet but they have 31 episodes out there apparently huh so is it is every episode tailored
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   for somebody else you know it's you personally oh no no no I think it's just saying you as in the
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:25.040]   listener oh the group of listeners yeah so give us all your information and we'll make a show you
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:33.280]   like well no give it taken their information their information who's information will sasso and
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:38.800]   Chad oh then going through their stuff oh I get the way this were you okay okay
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:45.360]   uh truth social will be in the app store any minute now Google has approved it
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:53.600]   I guess they've got their moderation uh working uh which was which was the hold up they weren't
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:59.360]   allowed to go there until they show Apple has still not approved it Google spokesperson said
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:05.440]   they first notified two social about several violations of standard policies in their app
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:11.360]   submission and barded from approval on August 19th uh truth social is responded to Google's
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:17.840]   satisfaction I think that's one of those the funny story of the week which is just after Google
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:24.160]   shuts down the stadium it it decides to launch gaming laptops oh yeah and I was wondering if you
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:31.040]   would get all excited about this these are uh Chromebooks but specifically designed for
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:36.160]   wait a minute how are you gonna play a game on a Chromebook if Stadia's gone big up
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:44.320]   horse wait a minute uh an upcoming line of Google Chromebooks made in partnership with Acer
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.520]   ASUS and Lenovo have been designed with cloud gaming features in mind
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:56.800]   but you can't play on a Chromebooks that was well if you must know when I asked for games you just
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:03.600]   can't use Google's Stadia you can use Xbox G-Force now or Amazon luna Xbox on the Chromebook
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:09.360]   yeah they they're all shipping with three different streaming platforms pre-installed Xbox oh is that
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.280]   how g-force now and Amazon luna but yeah you have to think Google planned this a year ago
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.680]   with these companies so that they could say and now you can play Stadia on a Chromebook whoops
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:27.920]   whoops right hand beat left hand these are not cheap by the way the Lenovo's 600 bucks
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:34.720]   Acer's is 650 dollars the ASUS is not yet one presumes they must have good screens and
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.720]   and good processors to be made for gaming well no but that's the thing you don't really need a
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.880]   lot of processing power when you're streaming it you need enough streaming okay right display
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.640]   so the refresh rates are 120 Hertz and above it'll have Wi-Fi six or six e high quality audio
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:57.120]   RGB keyboards gamers you know like their keyboards to be colorful but no these are you know their
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:02.640]   i3's or i5's they're eight gigs of RAM they're just not okay not not super powerful
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.000]   but they're powerful enough and they have good enough displays I think it's probably the main
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:16.080]   the main point 16 inch screens 2560 by 1500 120 Hertz refresh on the buying one I don't
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:25.920]   come on colored screen come on keyboard I'm too old it's clearly was designed back when they thought
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:29.600]   yeah you know they were pretty funny they're gonna have some Google just doesn't know how to
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.920]   out of birth things and kill things forecasting fail
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:40.640]   you put in a thing a story for Stacy
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:48.080]   so the washington post went full moral panic yeah tour Amazon's dream home where every
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:56.000]   appliance is also a spy okay all right point taken right and so it goes on you know my favorite
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:03.280]   one was was because you can use your Amazon stuff to open the garage door you've now given
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:10.080]   Amazon the key to your house come on bro I can see one problem right here you can't have a tree
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:16.880]   growing on the second floor of a house where the roots going I mean there's a problem right there
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:24.080]   washington post the echo speaker what this really is is an excuse to go through google device
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:29.120]   I mean Amazon devices that complain about say you know what they what they do like they're
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.960]   complained about the toilet with that Alexa integration um you can't go for a minute than that and
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:43.200]   what are they gonna do with it well the Ozir right or I mean I don't mind but I can I think people
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:48.000]   are rapidly getting kind of fed up with this well that's generally true but this is a ridiculous
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.080]   substantiation of that there's fine stories to be done about that and there's fine stories to
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.280]   but about ringing Amazon and all that but this just goes this is just stupid actually I don't
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:03.120]   I disagree I think this is pretty a pretty good example of all the things Amazon is offering
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.520]   these are not made up products all of them are smart soap dispenser we don't know what Amazon
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:14.000]   could do with it about your personal hygiene but but what Amazon needs the head washing
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.800]   did it to provide function come on come on we can panic about that there's so much more
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.200]   believey there is so much more to panic about in the world right now people it's not your soap
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.720]   dispenser and your toilet being connected to anything get over yourselves you don't matter
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.680]   that much nobody cares that much about when you wash your hands and whether you do or do not
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:40.080]   when you leave the toilet except the members of your family hey smart soap we've been snap that
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:50.000]   as a highlighter you say nobody does the post does say we don't know what Amazon could do with
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.520]   data about your personal hygiene Amazon says it needs the hand washing data to help provide
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:01.840]   functionality so apparently it is sending information about you know my apple watch
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:06.240]   and actually it's a little nanny issue I'm about to turn it off but every time I start washing my
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:12.000]   hands a countdown timer starts it knows I'm really that's a no boy yeah and then it gives a little
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:18.880]   abse-ding when it's 20 seconds and you know this is a one Mississippi two business you don't have
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.160]   to because the watch is counting for you what was we were supposed to sing happy birthday twice
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:30.320]   happy birthday twice and then but you know didn't we learn that that wasn't the real threat of
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:36.080]   covid that was airborne oh oh other other diseases yes but i still wash your hands i guess yeah well
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:40.800]   probably good to wash your hands but do you have to wash them for 20 seconds no i don't think so
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:46.320]   you're not a surgeon no okay exactly all right like a surgeon
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:53.840]   now see that's parody that's that's protected although it does it's it's been done i just
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:59.840]   copied the parody you parody parody doesn't weird al ask permission uh before he does a song i
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:04.800]   think he does yeah i think he does because partly he just doesn't also want to piss off the people
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:10.720]   that he's out parroting and i think for the most part people are flattered by it right for the
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:16.800]   honor yeah hey good news dart worked so uh you don't have to worry we're safe we're safe
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:21.440]   uh nasa's dart mission they had a press conference yesterday successfully
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:27.440]   shoved the asteroid the orbital change was even bigger than scientists expected
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:36.720]   the double that made me nervous like we got a result different than what we expected i really
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:42.000]   wanted a precision result and maybe it is exactly what they thought just they had a range and it was
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.160]   the higher range but i i don't want like they wouldn't need it is 73 seconds and they got what 30
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:56.720]   minutes wow it does sound like an an orbit time that's the uh the the length of time
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:01.680]   of the uh a million miles away don't they get a little grace
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.640]   and caffees going through an and and uh android panic i was going to say asteroid panic
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:11.520]   all the droids are really bothering me right now
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:22.320]   so uh this was just a small nudge they could do more if they had to so good news
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:28.720]   i'm sure mr pal is going to talk about this more on friday okay i gotta ask you this i'm sorry i have
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:38.640]   to ask you this did he long talked to pouton or not well we're not sure because uh bremer said that
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:45.920]   elan told him that he had talked to pouton and then bremer said that out loud and then elan came back
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:52.880]   and said no i he's lying i didn't so who do you trust more he and bremer who has a whole big
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:08:00.720]   um think tank around world affairs and nuclear wars or elan musk bremer said elan musk told me
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:06.800]   he was said it and lied about calling pouton so what's the lie that he didn't say he called pouton
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:09.280]   or that he didn't call pouton what were the other he probably lied
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.840]   yeah he lied to somebody yeah either bremer or self-worth well he lied
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:21.840]   okay if you tell one person two conflicting things one of them's not true
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:31.040]   exactly so he guaranteed he lied to bremer yeah yeah yeah good logic logic shows all right i'm just
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:38.880]   curious uh where do we stand on the twitter acquisition uh nothing new nothing new nothing
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.360]   not nanny how about kanye he's got a deadline of 28 of 20th to close this thing or else that
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:52.880]   trial is going to go i think it's the 28th talk about ego so kanye west says some absolutely
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:59.760]   reprehensible things about jewish people about black people uh just you know just awful stuff
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:08.880]   so elan calls him and says oh hey i talked to kanye or ye as he's known and uh
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:15.920]   really he's going to be okay it's going to he's what do he apologize or something and uh so we're
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.200]   going to bring him back to he's up he's back on welcome back he said as if he had the choice
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.600]   who kanye got banned from twitter and instagram uh as if he had the choice elan said welcome back
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:33.520]   kanye like who's not here in this scenario yeah um
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:41.200]   and you got you at the same time you have you have musk of course sucking up to g and china
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:47.760]   which didn't do them any good um here's here's what elan said talk to ye today
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:56.160]   elan is yeah the ego oh my god talk to ye today all right elan musk for ye
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:07.840]   hi this is ye okay that's flighty uh no uh i'm i'm expressing my concerns about your recent tweet
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:14.720]   yeah man i'm taking it to heart okay thanks i'll i'll just mention that yeah twitter yeah um
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:20.560]   if this is his idea of how he plans to moderate twitter
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:26.480]   he's gonna call everybody hey dude you shouldn't you shouldn't say that
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:34.240]   um he didn't even say that the way i was early early in vlogging days i'd go after people individually
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.480]   you know it just shouldn't say that uh it does somebody did raise the point i think the washing
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:46.960]   post that in texas twitter would not be allowed to take that tweet down right yep uh here was right
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:55.120]   kathy right roll right before uh we started recording um there was an order from the fifth circuit
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:03.280]   they are staying the mandate oh go the fifth circuit decision is not in effect um i mean this is not
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.760]   like oh we're all we're out of this stuffy to worry about it just sort of we can take a breath
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:13.600]   but then i think there's gonna be scoda's challenge of it most likely because this cannot stand because
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:20.080]   yes exactly this law if it were in effect would not only be unconstitutional but it'd be unusable
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:28.000]   and yeah but all sorts of companies uh twitter, wicca, media um everybody would be in a bind of like
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.240]   you can't get rid of the bad stuff that you really need to get rid of so that's all i think somebody
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:38.880]   needs to call jameel jaffer who is the executive director of the night first amendment institute
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:44.720]   which sounds to me like an expert in the first amendment who says i saw him last week who says
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:50.320]   kanye's tweet is a vile tweet but there's no question it's protected by the first amendment
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:58.000]   well yes but that's not for it right oh he can't be arrested it's government right but he can be
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.800]   banned by twitter for it absolutely because twitter has the first amendment right to choose
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:09.120]   yeah private excoriation and refusal to associate that is also protected by the first
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.080]   amendment and that is the bit that an awful lot of people seem to be missing but that's a crux of
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.160]   what is wrong with the florida law and the texas law and a lot of people complaining about two
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:24.160]   what is jameel then responding to no one's threatened to arrest kanye no because some
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:29.280]   idiot reporter will say this is censorship it's gotten so skewed now i tweeted about this the other day
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:35.280]   that the right says that speech is censorship right you can't criticize me you're canceling
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.920]   me you're censoring me right well my speech is my reaction to you and say no you can't do that
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.960]   and then they're also saying that choice is censorship whether you're an editor or a publisher or a
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:50.080]   producer or a platform you can't take down my speech well no that's why i own the publishing
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.240]   house i get to choose what to publish no you don't you gotta publish it now um and so speech
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:02.000]   becomes censorship and and they have no sense of irony about that and choice becomes censorship
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.600]   and that's their way to keep their speech up it's all it's just a house of mirrors now
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:12.720]   well i'm just glad elon musk is reaching out to any semites and uh and explaining and then making
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.080]   sure they're okay yeah what it's not okay all right
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.520]   you doing a change log let's do a google change log
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.560]   the google change log
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:36.880]   do you know what b.i. is business intelligence uh google had its cloud next conference this is one
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:42.480]   many of announcements uh yesterday at the cloud next conference google has said all of its business
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:47.440]   intelligence projects products will now be unified under to get ready for this
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.480]   the name looker
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:56.080]   so google
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:57.280]   cocko roll
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.800]   go go go go go
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:03.680]   oh looker well they bought a company called looker so they had the trademark so what the hell
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:10.240]   um yeah so just so you know google we're looking
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:12.720]   we hear you
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:23.040]   youtube has decided to now support at username yay youtube handles so this is of course a
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:28.640]   namespace used in twitter and on instagram and facebook and everywhere but in the past we've
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:34.240]   had to say you go to youtube.com/twit uh we will apply and i hope we'll be able to call
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:41.200]   ourselves at twit on youtube right i think you already have the we have it the url
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:48.960]   that people i didn't know you are now i have a vanity url already and i would have seen
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.440]   different no it doesn't automatically well no that that should transfer over should it but if you
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:59.360]   don't have a vanity url you have to apply for a handle and you can't apply for vanity url anymore
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.200]   because they shut that down waiting for this to happen oh so there's going to be a gap of time
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.760]   where you can't do anything about it support for handles we'll start rolling out later next week
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:13.280]   to protect creators from having their channel name staked by someone else uh youtube notes that
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:21.120]   channels that already have a personalized url so normally you get x379 4199 once you get a thousand
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:26.800]   followers you can say hey i want to be slash amp pruit or slash twitters that's correct so you got
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:33.760]   that yes sir so you will then be at okay and underscore pruit just like you are on twitter and
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:41.360]   instagram yeah i'm already that people tag me now on um youtube post and comments just by doing that
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:46.240]   oh so it's already working for you is already working for me it always has been that way for
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:52.320]   after a handle is established youtube will additionally create a matching url on the form of youtube.com/athandle
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:01.760]   which would allow you to market your handle elsewhere on the web or in other media and if the channel
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:06.480]   already had a personalized url it was using for a similar purpose you don't have to update your links
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:13.200]   it all will continue to work and at some point everybody should be able to get a handle
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.880]   look for notifications to arrive in the next month
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:23.360]   we already did the cloud gaming i you know i did some of the change-long stuff up front because i
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:30.240]   thought it was important i like this new feature in google meet it's always done um recordings of
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:35.520]   your meeting now they'll send you transcriptions which they've done was had for quite some time
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:43.120]   right yeah they've um they've did quite a lot of stuff in workspace uh users can already save
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.880]   google meet calls as video files they'll soon get an automatic transcription of their meeting too
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.640]   it'll uh it'll be a google doc it'll start in english this week support for french german
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.240]   spanish and portraquies is coming that's pretty cool
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:02.720]   yeah yeah i guess you'll have to uh you'll have to push a button or something
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:08.880]   later this month google will roll out a meet feature that will automatically center
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:15.280]   meeting participants in the frame of their video tile before they join a call you can reframe
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:21.120]   yourself later but it'll center you that's nice there's a meeting you're centered i just don't
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:27.840]   feel very centered just i i'm always centered there's a meeting room check well actually i have a
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:34.960]   problem with the centered stuff because uh apple and i bet you a lot of them center you so you know
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.440]   when we do stuff because we have lower thirds you try to get your head like just a little scotch
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:45.520]   below the top of the frame but apple will put you down here in the center of the frame all right
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.600]   which i bothers me yeah it doesn't look right to me so all about that middle third and then
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.480]   when you do the lower third not lower third the rule of thirds grid yeah that that i shouldn't be
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.960]   in the middle go across your eye that puts you in the center square to block you should be up
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:06.720]   but i also i keep on wanting catholic to get take that tape down off the wall behind her there's
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:13.760]   a piece i know i keep wanting to but it's not my tape so yeah we'll fix it in post when i uh
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:20.800]   when i did this site with soledad o'brien i was a virtual reality character and they put a blue
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:26.000]   piece of tape on the wall for her to stare at because all right because she couldn't see me
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:34.400]   dev no is that called no dev no uh she couldn't see me so she had it had the
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.800]   eyeline had to be right like she was looking at me so um she should roll her eyes out the blue tape
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:46.640]   she did believe me although i have to say she was just on Andy Richter's three questions
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:54.320]   podcast and she said very nice things about me which i was very oh yeah yeah she she called me
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.520]   here's the site open now i just want to point out
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:07.840]   that uh here i am talking to her she's staring at a blue piece of tape not me
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:15.920]   stop that nbc stop that and i also want to point out the reason i was thinking this and i was
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.520]   watching this video is because i got a call or an email yesterday from the producer of the show
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:28.240]   david borman who said hey you want the sign look at there i want to see if i could see the sign as it

[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:17.840]   ago they finally fully replaced android auto for phone screens with google assistant driving mode
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:23.440]   now they're taking google maps integration away which means it's useless
[02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:30.240]   actually according to an update uh nine five google says google is actually shutting down
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:40.960]   the assistant driving mode dashboard so uh just add that to the killed killed by google

[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:29.840]   but first a word just a personally from me to you uh beseeching you please begging you to join club
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:35.520]   twit i know uh you probably have heard us talk about club twit we started this earlier this year
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:41.040]   as uh we realized that well there are people who watch our shows who don't want to hear the ads they
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:46.560]   don't want to be tracked and that's kind of a necessity these days in podcast advertising so
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:51.520]   we said well what we'll do is we'll give you ad free versions of all the shows no tracking
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.520]   uh for seven bucks a month then we said you know we should throw in some other things so we created
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:01.520]   this club twit discord which has turned out to be amazing uh a lot of us are in there chatting about
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:08.000]   not just about the shows but about everything going on in the world and coding and food and cooking and
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:16.320]   you know um anime and beer and fitness and hardware and ant pruits are fabulous wonderful
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.960]   uh community manager he puts together events like stacy's book club we have shows that are exclusive
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:30.640]   uh to the club for instance uh like hands-on macintosh with mica sergeant and hands-on windows
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:35.120]   with paul thirat we've got the untitled linux show jonathan bennett that gives fizz with dikti
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:40.640]   bartollo stacy's book club all of that goes on in the discord and then goes out to the twit plus feed
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:45.360]   that twit plus bonus content is all kinds of stuff those shows plus stuff that happens before and
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:52.640]   after our shows and just fun things all of that all of that for seven bucks a month and it makes a
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:58.560]   big difference for us in keeping the lights on you know i i you know if we if you have a vision for
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:05.280]   what twit might look like five years from now i think club twit is vital to that future going
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:10.480]   forward so i know a lot of you can't afford seven bucks a month that's fine we will always still
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:14.800]   offer this great free stuff we don't want to put stuff you know we don't want to put our best
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:20.160]   stuff behind paywalls but we have additional benefits that we understand if you do pay seven
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:26.640]   bucks you know it's a nice uh reason to do so go to twit.tv/clubtwit if you want to know more
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:29.920]   you can buy any of those shows individually for two ninety nine a month as well
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:34.560]   uh and there's a yearly plan and there's corporate plans and all of that so just a little plug
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:40.640]   for club twit because uh it really makes a big difference for us keeping that fun doing a
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:50.000]   stage recently nice um with one of our members uh i was working on a test shot because again i'm

[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:27.920]   twit.tv/clubtwit now let me see Kathy if i got a link uh yes
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:33.840]   okay go ahead Kathy Gellis her pick of the week
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:40.880]   can you load it yes i have a picture of it hail to the so there was a play called
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:48.480]   life spirit many moons ago there was about us a medium and a seance right
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:56.240]   yes i don't quite remember so much about the plot of the play the point for doing this is i'm
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:02.800]   uh very very sad about the passing of angela lance berry i grew up watching murder she wrote
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:10.320]   episodes this is quite important to my growing up um and then but i include this link because i
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:16.240]   had the privilege of seeing her perform in blind spirits um not in the broadway production but
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:20.800]   there was a traveling production that came through san francisco and she was in it and this
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:28.320]   review this is the review of the traveling production and just such presence i mean it's sort of skewed
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.560]   the production a little bit because she was a supporting character and the audience wanted
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:38.000]   a clap every day all they wanted was more more angela but um and it was a good production otherwise
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.440]   and the one of the people who played the man is a guy who played um who was on down to abbey
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:50.080]   charles edwards lady this publisher yeah yes so uh so he you know it's nice to see him act too but
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:55.600]   um i recently also watched death on the Nile where she was also playing a supporting character
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:02.080]   and she just steals the scene every time she's there and this review was reminding me of of the play
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:09.120]   that i saw where she was 89 years old and just owning that stage and it was a very physical role
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.000]   and she gave it everything and it was just such a privilege to get to see her her work or craft
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.080]   she was such a distinctive actress and you know played like Jessica Fletcher is a really admirable
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:28.480]   female character um absolutely tough smart um but kind and like just um yes so i will miss the
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:34.160]   the woman who played her and also Jessica Fletcher because i always yeah she was she was
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:41.600]   wonderful actor it's amazing that she was able to do a two-hour place seven nights a week at the
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:48.320]   age of 89 as she was i mean and then to steal the show on top of it pretty impressive yeah it was
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:52.320]   really excellent and it was a privilege to get to see her and i can kind of see her in my mind a
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:58.640]   little bit i'm so jealous that you saw this uh Simon Simon Jones was also in it who is a very
[02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:04.720]   well-known British actor who was in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy um wow i i'm so jealous that
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:12.480]   you saw this and i love it that she stole the show at the age of 89 she was i saw her in swinny Todd
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:22.560]   uh oh with oh that was an amazing production with um oh i can't remember his name he was so good
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:29.120]   um one of my favorite shows of all time Len Carreyue yeah Len Carreyue yeah he was also a
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:34.720]   murder she wrote all the time they were obviously oh really oh i didn't know that oh yes yes he
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:39.520]   played a very interesting recurrent character and my understanding is murder she wrote tended to be
[02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:44.960]   cast with she'd been in the Hollywood for so long so it basically was cast largely by her friends i
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:49.440]   don't think i've ever seen an episode i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to start watching it oh my gosh
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:55.600]   um yeah i saw her and Len Carreyue and one of the best shows of all time and i knew nothing about
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:03.280]   i knew his son i'm i love son i'm and it begins so dramatically and so wonderfully um
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:11.280]   ah i'll never forget it i'll never forget it so that's cool yeah i'm a fan too sad sad loser at
[02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:20.480]   96 the same age as queen yes and my father and your father Jeff Jarvis do you have any other numbers
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:28.800]   i have uh the number is 911 oh because uh iPhones and their watches are calling 911 when people are on
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:34.320]   rollercoaster i'm thinking they've crashed now mind you mind you
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:39.840]   uh if this happened with me and i was on a rollercoaster go ahead and send the ambulance
[02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:43.760]   because if i'm on a rollercoaster with my fear of heights i've had a hard attack on me at all yeah
[02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:53.360]   yes well wall street journal said that one a small town uh emergency services had in um
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:59.360]   the Warren County communications center had received six crash detection calls for people at king
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:07.760]   island rides all from iPhone 14s or new apple watches triggered by the joker rollercoaster
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:14.880]   at sick oh this is another one in chicago at six flags great america chicago um and the jersey
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:19.600]   problem is that this thing's in your pocket and you don't know and it's like you're screaming
[02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:26.880]   it's loud screaming so uh yeah 911 doesn't usually like that but they've got to follow it down
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:32.560]   um the wall street journal version has the audio of the call it's not that exciting but it's
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:39.760]   yeah because it says there was a severe crash not there might be a severe crash but there was a
[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:47.360]   severe crash so there's not yeah anyway i think it's an unbalanced a good thing here's the call
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:57.200]   this is the uh phone calling 911 that goes to a free race
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:01.360]   where are they the owner of this iPhone looking at the
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:12.160]   so it's the voice just in the order because i thought was it a severe crash and you hear
[02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:20.400]   the background you hear your screams so this is a fixable uh problem apple just
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:27.680]   just to add if you hear screams and rollercoaster sounds or you don't just say hey are they at six
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:36.000]   flags uh maybe you shouldn't say is that again again here screams then yeah yeah if it's a scream
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:44.960]   and it's a six flag it's me i'm having art at that come please come i love it 911 and now
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:51.280]   you're a thing of the week my thing in the week is on a folkset aperture they have their amaran
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:57.120]   addition of lights and this is their more budget friendly version of lights aperture makes
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:02.720]   a bunch of studio lights and led lights that are quite expensive but they're really diagram
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:10.080]   good and amaran brand is is basically competing with the likes of godox um they're a little more
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.680]   expensive than godox but not by much and they're nice pretty pretty nice build quality they're not
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:20.720]   as metallic so there's still some plastic casing and stuff on them the reflector is nice i have the
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:27.120]   100d here uh the d stands for daylight to color temperature they have a couple that are by color
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:32.640]   so you can change the the color temperature on them and um pretty good pricing on them and the
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:37.600]   fans are quiet it's not super loud when you turn them up the high power the reflector is
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:43.040]   definitely different seems like it gives you a bit of a narrow beam when you put the reflector on it
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.440]   so just be mindful of that but yeah pretty good price i think this 100d is like 200 bucks and oh
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:54.080]   look you could mount a uh and you can put an umbrella on not all of the lights in that range
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.720]   allow you to mount umbrellas to them like that so in case it's raining right
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:07.760]   all right in case this is a rain that's exactly what that's for yeah apu t-u-r-e a poocher
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:16.640]   aperture um and then next i was on the mobile filmmaking podcast spp mobile filmmaking podcast

[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.200]   so i know a lot of you twig and twit folks are here in the area because i've bumped into you a
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:05.360]   couple times so if you're in area go order take it and check out the show november 18th through
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:12.320]   december 4th at the studio theater saner rosorjr college sponge bob the musical would you say
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:21.280]   it's suitable for children yes i've watched it unfortunately yes it's too much for many many times
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:26.720]   is that the burbank theater is a pretty nice theater too and uh and queen prude plays
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:36.240]   sandy cheeks sandy cheeks yeah okay i have a question for you my son the tiktok star
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:43.920]   wants to get a cannon cinema and he's trying to decide between the r5c and the c70 do you have
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:52.000]   an opinion uh yes for me i would go the r5c because you get the you get both sides and still
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.520]   you get the yeah you get the photography side he doesn't care if he doesn't do stills it's just
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:04.560]   for video okay so if you go but the thing is he does have an r5 i bought him an r5 some time ago
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:11.920]   about a year ago but uh he wants the cinema because he's it's all about the the video for him right
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:17.440]   well both of them are really good for video the only main difference i would point out with the c70
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.360]   is the c70 has a super 35 sensor so it's going to be a tight crop factor it's not full frame
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:28.960]   it's not full frame but you're still getting good dynamic range and getting the dual gain
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:36.400]   um dual gain iso on there so uh yeah iso so it's going to be pretty good for both of them
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:41.120]   but just depends on what you want so i would have said the r5c because you get the best of both
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:47.760]   words i will tell him i said i'd ask you tell him he needs i need to get him um for a chat
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:52.080]   so i need to get in touch at all yeah well he's going to have some stuff to promote soon
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:59.200]   okay so i can say good for him yeah for except for him he's doing really well uh
