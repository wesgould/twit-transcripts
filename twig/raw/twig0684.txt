[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey. Jeff and Ant are here and man oh man have we got news.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.720]   Elon Musk says okay okay I'll buy Twitter.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.640]   I think it's all a clever ploy by the Delaware judge.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.600]   We'll talk about the Supreme Court. There's a couple of cases on the docket that will affect Twitter

[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.320]   Well mostly, I'll be honest with you. We're gonna try.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   We're gonna try our darned.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   We're gonna try our darned. Is that Stacey Higgenbotham?
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   Yay Stacey!
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.320]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   Do you like how I worked them like on that when I yelled the "Yay Stacey, I got way off way off."
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   Just like Adele does.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   I like you were far away.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   Yeah, I'm doing the Adele thing. I watched her on TV and she goes, you know,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   "Someday, I'll always love you."
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   That kind of thing.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   Yeah, you probably don't want to be in the receiving end of a full Adele belt.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   No, that's a hell of a belt.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   Stacey on IOT is her fabulous website. Get the newsletter there.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   It's free check the events and of course subscribe to the IOT podcast.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   Stacey does it with Kevin Toful.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   And I can guess what that's gonna be all about this week.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   I can guess, but we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   Then to my left, the Leonard Tal Professor for Journal of Human Information,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   the J端rgen Hebermosser Professor at the Craig Numach graduate school of...
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   Cholism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Habamoss. J端rgen Habamosser.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   Brand new, I just arrived today.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   Is it J端rgen?
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   I know it's J端rgen.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   Definitely Kate und de deliberativ politique.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   Yeah, so I have to know what this says. I really do.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   It arrives and then I finally discover the translation.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   Oh nuts.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   But this is good. It'll be good for practicing new German.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   Yeah, it's good for your brain.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   It makes me look smart.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   Michael, who studies, he's like in German for now,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   gets a German magazine called Der Fenster.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   The window.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   The window into German land.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   It's really fun.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   Yeah, it's a good way.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   Reading Germans, a good way to practice.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Somebody does not need to practice his photography.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   Mr. Hands-off photography himself, Ant-brrut!
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Oh, I definitely need to practice my photography.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   That's how you stay good.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   Not just get good.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   How you stay good.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   I thought you were gonna have to practice your German, Ant.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   I was like, "Wow!"
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   Do not practice your German.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   Oh, I'll be more than happy to practice German,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   as long as it includes German cuisine.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   Does anybody here play chess?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   I play but I'm very good at it.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   Yeah, I'm bad.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   Anybody following?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   I'm trying to figure out what's going on with the chess scandal.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   I can't figure...
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   Does it really include AI and buck plugs?
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   I was gonna say, I heard something that's pretty erotic.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   They can't figure out.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320]   So, here's the thing.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   I think we've mentioned this before, but now it's in the esteemed Wall Street Journal,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   so it must be true.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   There's a guy, a young kid, he's 19, and Hans Neiman.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   He's actually from the San Francisco Bay Area via, I think, Holland.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   But he's grown up in the U.S.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   Wall Street Journal is now reporting on a study by chess.com.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   Actually, let me find the journal article here, because this is not from the journal.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   On the story from chess.com, chess.com is the number one online gaming site for chess players.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   I'm a member.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   It's a paid site.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   There's a free one that's probably just as good called "Lai Chess" but L-I-C-H-E-S-S.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   But chess.com is one of the biggest.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   There is a little bit of a conflict of interest here because they are about to acquire the world champion.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.320]   The world champion, Magnus Carlsen's site, chess24.com, or merge with it.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.320]   So they're in a financial relationship with Magnus Carlsen.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   This began when Magnus Carlsen was playing young Hans in a St. Louis chess tournament called the Sinkfield Cup,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   very, very big time top grandmaster tournament.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   It was kind of an amazing thing for Hans Neiman, who has risen through the ranks and become grandmaster in an amazingly rapid way.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   Neiman, who had the black pieces, surprisingly defeated the world champion,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   who is not only much more highly rated, but of course the world champion,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   at which point Magnus Carlsen, the world champion withdrew from the tournament,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.320]   with the saying nothing but with the implication that Neiman had cheated.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   Then he played him another game later in which he resigned after one move, again a symbolic resignation to say,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   "I'm not going to play this guy because this guy cheats."
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   He finally did admit that that's what the problem was.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Chess.com did a big investigation.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   The way they investigate now is high.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   Here's the thing, none of this cheating has occurred in the past,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   but it was on the level of, I think it was one of the car-pop world championship matches
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   where his opponent said he's looking, he's staring at me.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   It was on that level.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   He gets up every move and it's making me nervous.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   Bobby Fisher famously said, "These cameras, they're worrying, and the Russians have put things in the lights to distract me."
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   It was at that level, but now that computers can play better than any human life.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   Literally, you can put a computer on your Pixel 6 that will beat Magnus Carlsen ten out of ten times.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   The best players, those computers now can be used effectively to cheat even at the highest levels.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   The problem is how you get the moves from the computer.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   At the highest levels, Magnus Carlsen, Hans Neiman, even a little help at a couple of critical junctures could make a huge difference.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.740]   That's how tight these games are how how very very good they are. These players are
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.780]   So you wouldn't have to like be going in the bathroom every five moves to look at your phone
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.960]   You could be just getting a signal from somebody every one or two like
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   And that might be enough to shift the whole game right so there's been that more curly
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.320]   So chess calm a
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.820]   Couple of weeks ago
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.120]   Fired Neiman they said you can't play here anymore
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.600]   Neiman had admitted when he was young 12 and 16. He's a 12. This is the other side of this. He's a twitch streamer
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   So he's very well known and has a lot of fans in that community
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:16.060]   He admitted when he was 12 and 16. He says young I didn't know 16. He's three three years older now
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.360]   He said yeah, I cheated on some online games. I've never cheated over the board like in person
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.380]   Chess calm had banned him in the past
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.140]   They now have fully banned him from that site and everybody said well
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:32.500]   Why and for a while chest calm said we're not gonna release this study. They finally did and the Wall Street Journal has seen it
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   I guess they didn't release it publicly, but the journal has seen the internal report in which
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.880]   Chess calm found that Neiman had likely cheated more than a hundred games
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.580]   By the way all of these online
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.260]   They have no allegations so far so far. It's all online
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:57.980]   But but there have been you know there's a lot of statistics and there's back and forth if you follow the
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.680]   Chess subreddit on Reddit you'll you'll see you know
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.220]   There are fans of both that all the grandmasters are now starting to weigh in
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.660]   It's my opinion that it's pretty clear that Neiman was up to something
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.900]   But the question was how did he cheat in the sinkfield cup?
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.900]   How did he beat the best player in the world and then by the way the other kind of smoking gun is after the game?
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.300]   He's doing an interview and he doesn't seem to understand the game at all
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:31.380]   It's like he's talking about is now analyzing the moves is wrong. It's like well that wouldn't that's what?
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.500]   So that's a little bit of a smoking gun like yeah, you didn't even know what he was doing
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   but they
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.100]   And I talked about this before they did a couple of things to the live stream
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:49.020]   They you know they live stream these live live and so you could have a Confederate at home watching the live stream somehow getting
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:55.140]   Information to you maybe a Confederate sitting there's a live audience and way as well sitting in the live audience going
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.360]   Neee-nee-nee are you gonna get are you gonna get to the speculation? I'm getting there now. I'm getting there
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   I'm almost there right now
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.380]   right I'm so close so
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.820]   sinkfield cup folks delayed
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:15.860]   the live feed by 15 minutes they also took a long time to scan him for electronics now notice Neeman has bushy hair
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:23.580]   So it's possible. He's concealing something up there, but then some were some saying well, you know in fact
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.220]   There isn't a well-known chest cheating incident with a guy having something in his shoe
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.480]   That would that would vibrate in a code
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.020]   Because you can't Maxwell smart. Yeah, you can't I mean you could and it has happened that people would go to the bathroom and look at their
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.260]   Phone, but they're pretty they don't let you have your at this level
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.580]   They don't let you have your phone and they keep an eye on you and so forth
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.940]   So they scan them with electronics scanners and stuff. They took a long time like 15 minutes
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.580]   Found nothing. He did not win the tournament by the way
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.220]   He was he took the lead by beating Carlson
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.860]   But immediately declined after that and this is the other kind of smoking gun is that's the pattern of his career
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.860]   He plays exceptionally well sometimes and somewhat
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.380]   Poorly, he's not a bad player. He's a very very good player
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.620]   Without the aid of a computer even but is he that good is he so good?
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.980]   Is he a world-class player is he top player and I it's my opinion now that he's cheating somehow we can't figure out
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.220]   So this is where the butt plug comes
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:28.820]   They can't figure out exactly not just butt plug, but AI and butt plug we have we have reached the apotheosis of all
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.820]   Technology moral panic and stories there needs to be a way to
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:39.140]   First and again, you don't have to signal him on every I don't know if that's exactly moral panic, but think of the children
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.620]   No, that's wrong
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.180]   There you don't have to again. You don't have to cheat every move
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.260]   You don't have to get the move from the computer every time just maybe a couple of times again
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.040]   Just had a critical juncture you need to know and and in Neman
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.300]   Carlson knowing he was gonna play name and played a line
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:02.180]   He'd never had played before so one of the things gramasters do before tournament is they prepare for their opponent looking every literally every game
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.340]   They've ever played to understand what openings they use
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.980]   Carlson played an opening he'd never played before Neman was prepared not only for that opening but found a novelty which is very rare
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.300]   He says oh, yes, I use weird. I was studying that this morning like that's his excuse
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:23.140]   Pretty clear. He got a signal, but how we couldn't find anything in his hair. We couldn't find anything in his shoes
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   Where oh where I?
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:34.020]   Don't think honestly that a vibrating butt plug you know, it'd be hard to hide your reaction to that right so
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.100]   I'm of the opinion. He had a Confederate
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.580]   In fact once they stopped this they stopped the livestream and delayed it by 15 minutes
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.300]   He didn't play as well. It's my in fact
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.100]   He tends to play much better whenever there's a live stream my opinion had a Confederate who was somehow signaling him
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.060]   You know through it could again
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:59.780]   We don't know the somehow we'd have there is and this is in Neman's defense. No one's found the proof of this at all ever
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.140]   He has a chip in smoking plug smoking
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:18.660]   Anyway, I'm leading with that so we can defer a defer talking about a show title already
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:27.460]   We have so many exciting things Google launched a bunch of devices. They're updated their Google home thing
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.140]   There's matter. There's so much to talk about and there's Elon
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.060]   And we'll get to Elon a little bit, but the matter is now matter is now official we
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:42.940]   I just I think it was you who debunked the notion that matter was gonna matter
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:49.020]   Stacey well, so I explained and if you scroll all the way down we have a list of stories
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:56.420]   Just to explain but like matter is not gonna be as exciting as everybody wants. It's a lower layer
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.540]   Yeah, five ways matter will disappoint users at lunch. That's nice
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:09.780]   So so that's that's that like you could but it does matter and it matters because it is going to be a
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.700]   Low layer of interoperability and anytime you have a layer of a drop ability. That's good
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:22.020]   Now would I like it to be a little bit higher by now? Yes when they launched it back in 2019
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.260]   What they were offering was pretty pretty awesome, but you know, I have to apologize
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.460]   I'm kind of launched into this without any
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:36.620]   matter is a joint venture of Microsoft Google Apple no no
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.420]   Microsoft is not a ball Microsoft matter
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.940]   Apple Zigbee Z wave
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   No, no here we go
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.580]   Dragon
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.940]   Google Apple Amazon Samsung
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.020]   Those are the big four and then there's like
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.180]   540 other companies like on the chip side on the other like signify
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:09.660]   Nordic semiconductors silicon labs and Finian all these companies Microsoft is actually not a member is Zigbee or Z wave a member so
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.780]   The Zigbee Alliance matter was created originally as project connected home over IP project chip
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.780]   It was part of the Zigbee Alliance
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.500]   Like Zigbee is one of the two
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.980]   best known protocols for Zigbee is a wireless protocol for the smart for it
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.460]   See wave is an all about a smart home home automation
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.940]   Yes, this is this is an interoperability protocol for the smart home
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.340]   So the Zigbee Alliance was like well crap. We're gonna call this whole thing matter and
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.140]   Zigbee isn't really part of matter because it's not so we should change our name
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.020]   So they now call themselves the connectivity standards Alliance
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:55.180]   They still have Zigbee under there umbrella, but Zigbee and Z wave
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.700]   They won't go utterly away for a long time, but they are definitely on the the back end
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.580]   Does this replace be in we Z wave? Yes
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:13.060]   Sort of so instead of using something like Zigbee or Z wave which are both like low power low data rate mesh networks in the home
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:21.220]   You're gonna use thread and thread was actually created back in 2014 by Google Samsung
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.420]   a couple other companies
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.900]   And so thread is now your low data rate
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:36.460]   Mesh protocol for the smart home and then Wi-Fi is gonna be everything else anything with battery, etc
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.700]   So you'll have those and then Bluetooth is going to be how you provision your devices
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.700]   So you'll do something like Bluetooth belly to communicate initially with a brand new device
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:52.180]   Get it set up get it welcomed into the thread and Wi-Fi networks and from then on you could communicate with it
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:17:00.060]   Right and then you're gonna do that via QR code matters gonna make that super easy instead of having like soft AP
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.700]   I don't know if y'all remember like sometimes you used to have like
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.580]   You would have a device that would create its own Wi-Fi network and then your phone would be like, okay
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.860]   They're like turn off your Wi-Fi on your phone and then connect to this extra special Wi-Fi network
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.180]   So it was awful
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.460]   That's all we still do it 99.9% of the time and this isn't take over yet
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.540]   It isn't so any matter device though
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.940]   You're gonna get the matter device and if you've ever used home kit or some of the newer devices where they're just like hey
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.900]   Open app scan the QR code and it's like boop is this your Wi-Fi network into your password?
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.380]   You're like boop boop boop boop boop boop and then it's like I found it
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.300]   That's how many
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.260]   Manufacturers have attempted to get around this ridiculous setup Amazon
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.500]   stores your Wi-Fi and passwords and your account and then when you get a new Amazon device
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.060]   It says it's okay if I happen to know a friend who knows a friend who knows how to log in and you say oh, okay
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.100]   And it just gets on Apple uses subsonic sound
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.460]   To communicate from its Apple TV to the Apple devices
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.380]   So there people understand the setup process is awful
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.460]   And I guess the hope is maybe we can make this a standard process across all devices
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.260]   The setup process is gonna be easy if you buy a matter device getting it on your network is actually gonna work
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:24.380]   It's gonna be good. So that's awesome. The other thing that's gonna be awesome is if you have a matter device
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.140]   You're gonna be like oh, it doesn't matter if I live in a madam a or an Amazon Echo home system or a home
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:39.420]   It doesn't matter. It's all gonna work. Okay, so those are all gonna be great back work compatible Stacy or is this only new devices?
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.700]   um, it depends so
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:49.800]   Uses I know nothing can be a lot of the Google stuff we have already has threatened right?
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.940]   yes, so
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.540]   Things that have Zigbee radios and enough hardware and the manufacturer willing to update it
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:04.860]   Can go into can be like retroactively so thread uses the same frequency as Zigbee did
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:13.380]   It uses the same IEEE protocol. So the underlying wireless. It's 802.4. Oh, it's a stop 15.4
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.180]   802.15 4 it was just the same underlying standard of Zigbee
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.820]   So basically it's the same radio you just layer Zigbee or matter software on top of it
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.140]   so or thread in the in the OSI networking model
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:36.180]   The seven layer cake that is networking you have yeah, so thread is where we're about thread would be layer three matters layer five
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.900]   Because it's at the application layer. Oh, that's important
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.100]   So thread is a standard just like Zigbee. It's the IEEE standard
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:51.240]   That's that's at the low level of layer three and on top two layers up is an application protocol
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.480]   And that's what that's that's what matter is is an application protocol. It's pretty high up in the stack
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:03.120]   It's super high up in the stack and what it is is it's basically it's it's a data. It's a data framework. So
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.060]   All that matter is going to do this is how you should conceptualize it for the devices it supports
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.580]   This version supports most devices, but it doesn't support things like small appliances
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.060]   It doesn't support video. So your video doorbell or cameras are not part of this
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.920]   But for the devices it supports. It's going to do things like hi. I'm a plug
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.440]   I am on or I am off
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.420]   Hi, I'm a light bulb. I'm on I'm off. I'm this color
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.940]   I'm dimmed I'm dimmed to this level whatever and all of that will be standard across no matter any matter
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.000]   Device can read and understand and talk to each other that way right you have a standard messaging
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.080]   Protocol and a way of saying this is these are the things I understand and
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.440]   These this is how you tell me to do something. This is yeah
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:55.160]   I mean this is what object oriented programming is trying to solve by saying you you build these black boxes and then you have
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.800]   established interface on how to query them and
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.560]   So if you're like them and so forth
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:06.640]   Yeah, and if you're like any normal human being you're like oh my god Stacy. I don't care about wife
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.520]   I am but you do calls it stacks. Oh, but you care. There's nothing works
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.920]   Right. Well, here's here's what you should know as a consumer
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.800]   Today they're going to so this week
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.080]   Matt the CSA said hey matter version one is now official and it's out
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:32.920]   They also said that there are about 4,000 devices from our existing members that are actually already ready and certified
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.040]   Because they've been doing all that work this summer
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:42.000]   Other people can now start the certification process. So we are going to see matter devices
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.320]   Instantly pretty much so that's what the news is is that this protocol is now in version 1-0. It's official. Yes
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.920]   That's version 1.0. That is our news and you're gonna see things like like Google
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.400]   this week also announced a bunch of devices and
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:06.200]   some of those devices like in Amazon last week and its devices they announced things that were matter certified and
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.840]   you should also pay attention because not only from
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.760]   kind of the the digital assistance and your routers and those kind of things
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.600]   You'll be looking for like is it matter certified? That means it can talk to all these devices
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.560]   You should also look for in your routers and digital assistance
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.640]   Is it a thread border router and what that will do is that is gonna let your thread devices?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.560]   And that's that low power sensors all of those things talk to your Wi-Fi network
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:40.360]   So that gets them back on to the Wi-Fi network and talking to all the other things that use Wi-Fi does matter to the security
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.240]   Yes, it does. I'm so glad you asked it offers encryption
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.000]   So to I love the one of the really good things about matter
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.240]   I may be kind of poo poo-ing like the advanced use cases which it won't be good out right away, but it does
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.880]   It's one of the first standards that offers basic security as part of it
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.280]   So any matter device is gonna have encryption
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.240]   It's going to require some sort of secure enclave and it's gonna require a certification process
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.720]   So when you have a matter device and you bring it under your network it checks back and it's like hey
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.800]   Is this legit and they'll have a certificate and this will go to the certificate authority and says certificate authority
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.600]   I'll say yes, it is and it will come back and we like yes, it is and you'll be like sweet
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.320]   So that kind of is this an improvement
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.400]   Then over so in other words should I look for matter instead of say Apple home keys we've recommended in the past
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.800]   Yes, it's a kind of a somewhat of a guarantee of us
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.300]   Obviously it doesn't do everything but of a certain level of security and capability and it or I'm more
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.400]   interoperability
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.880]   Yeah, and they took a lot of like many of the things that Apple has been focused on so
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:56.200]   things like local control apples always been way ahead of the game on that when compared to like Google or
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:04.360]   Amazon right so they definitely push that the QR code is actually how home kit devices get online so they borrowed that from Apple there's a lot
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.680]   inside
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.720]   Matter that comes from Apple which I think a lot of people will really appreciate
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:20.120]   Scooter X is reminding me of this story this earlier this week that ratcheo which is the home automation sprinkler system has stopped
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:27.520]   Using home kit because home kit can't resolve this no response error that users are getting
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.800]   so yeah, you know
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.720]   You might say oh well Apple must really get this and be able to do it better than anyone no
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.280]   Nobody nobody's really solved this problem
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.640]   Yeah, Apple's home kit
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.840]   I mean like depending on when because home kit went through a bunch of iterations
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.520]   I don't know at the very beginning don't may not remember this
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.880]   But you actually had to have like an MFI certification and you special hardware right expensive very expensive. Yeah
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.480]   They eliminated that hardware requirement a few years ago. That was a big they did yeah
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.840]   But they kind of brought some of that back
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.800]   So part of the hardware was security and having a secure enclave on the device and now you have that with these so
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:15.600]   Again, I mean that it does matter require any what does matter require for certification does not require a special chipset or anything like that
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.640]   Well, you have to have I mean you have to have Wi-Fi and
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:28.040]   Capabilities you have to have a thread radio Wi-Fi radio blue to that way you have to have in all the chip vendors are gonna offer
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.600]   matter certified chips, so there will be a Qualcomm system on a chip that will give you the matter
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:39.200]   stack I don't know if Qualcomm's participating at this level but Nordic in Phineon
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   XP silicon labs I should mention that almost all of those companies have been sponsors of my show at some point here's a great
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.800]   Current sponsor here's a great question for my IRC. We probably should have asked right at the beginning
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.680]   What is the problem matters trying to solve?
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.280]   What what question is the answer for?
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.680]   It's going to best buy and staring there and saying oh man I
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   Want a smart plug and I have a Google home not looking at all these things hoping it instead of plug
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:21.640]   I would like I was how about a thermostat or so
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.720]   Into a home depot
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.120]   Yes, and
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.240]   They already they they're a home kit user. Let's say they're a home kit user and
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.560]   Instead of looking for home kit stuff now you can look for matter stuff
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.000]   And there's gonna be more of it because remember home kit was kind of a pain
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.760]   And you'll no longer like if let's say you you bought the the right blinds
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.480]   But now you're like oh I want a thermostat and then you're like oh I want this thermostat
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.240]   Then you're like does this work with my ecosystem? I don't know so that's what it was solving so it's solving interoperability
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   it's also solving a
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.280]   reliability issue because
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.920]   Thread and having this high quality mesh network in the home
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.520]   Hopefully is going to make things work a little bit better and because a lot of these devices will have local control
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.040]   If you have a device whose cloud connection dies, let's say you have a device that its maker goes away
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.120]   For basic functionality it will retain that because it is
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.800]   Part of the matter it because it's speaking that same data model and can still give those local commands, right?
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   So that'll help there and then security having that level of security and certification. Those are the problems that solves it
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.920]   Well, we'll watch with interest of course Stacy really is our IOT expert and as you can tell it's gonna take an IOT expert to
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.400]   automate your home
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   and
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.440]   That's the point like you won't need an expert eventually like I think
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.320]   Eventually important so I think this year for the holidays
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.480]   You'll see matter like you could get your
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.720]   You could get your in-laws or someone
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   You know if you want to get on the smart lights that they can control with the voice system
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.440]   You could get them the voice speaker and then you could get the light bulbs
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.320]   And you'll know they'll just be easy to set up and work together. That's all step right there
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.880]   So this is solving stuff really soon. I thought you were saying that it's not going to handle a lot of things right out the gate
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.080]   So this is all that like common stuff right now
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.000]   It'll look it'll get you some devices up and running if you're like me and you have like 80 devices
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.680]   And you're gonna transfer a bunch of them over and you've got complex automations. No
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.120]   I'm gonna break matter all this month
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.400]   All right, okay, so Stacy
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:45.840]   You know, I think that the confusion has been a big market limiter for a long time since the beginning of of IOT right
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.320]   So if you were gonna predict market size if you're gonna if you were gonna draw a chart is it hockey sticky?
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.720]   Is it just oh a little happier? How much of a difference does this make to the market?
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.600]   You know
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.360]   Google in their thing on monday when I talk to them
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   Sorry, I don't know what that was. It was a 53 billion dollar market
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   So I don't I don't think it's hockey stickish
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.520]   Well, maybe it is over the longer term. What tends to happen is people buy like a use case
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.280]   So I think we'll see a lot of people buying like connected lights or plugs that are now finally easy, right?
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.600]   And then they'll be like oh I can totally do this and then they'll go out and buy more stuff. So
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:44.240]   Also, I think like with the economic kind of current economic conditions. I think it's kind of hard to imagine people like
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:50.640]   But I think you'll see people like maybe they show they'll have three devices and by the end of next year
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   They're gonna have like eight devices and that so how long before
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:02.400]   How long before you can be on the show and look back and say I told you this was gonna be so easy your grandmother could do it
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.720]   Well, I think I mean I think that'll happen like in a couple months
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.640]   Really?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.280]   I really do like I think the the use cases that your grandmother wants to do
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.440]   Yeah, okay your point before yeah, you just want to buy one thing for grandma, okay
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.640]   Well, even if you want to I mean like if you want to win a tennis, I mean a chess tournament, you know, so
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.920]   Hey, I didn't finish the chess thing by the way. Can we go back to that?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.720]   There's one more thing I forgot to mention the u.s.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.480]   Championship started today in fact round one is going on right now
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.840]   Neiman is playing he's about to win his first game
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:45.200]   $62,000 at stake and there is a lot of speculation around this and a lot of attention on
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.080]   on this tournament so
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.400]   That Hans Neiman story is not over yet and and the u.s. Championship is going to be a very interesting
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.520]   Couple can we hear 30 seconds of the commentary you want to hear how exciting it is go ahead here. I'm excited
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.680]   Let's just let's just turn my uh me as well
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.120]   The problem of course is yes, yes, you're sorry. I want to just so strong long time
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.000]   I can't get rid of it by playing bishop takes and if I take on it's like golf without grass
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.680]   I'm just not getting sufficient compensation anymore
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.840]   So perhaps a more practical approach is to take on f5 and then go knight and d4 and try to break me that
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.560]   Okay, okay, mr. Jarvis
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.800]   I got I got all I need I got honestly this isn't very interesting because he is about to win his very first game
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.920]   um, I mean the best way for Hans Neiman to
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.880]   Prove everybody wrong is to not cheat and win the u.s. Championship
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.000]   And then everybody's just gonna have to eat their words. How will they know whether he didn't cheat or not? Well, or uh,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.200]   I'm hoping it's the same place cavity search cavity search. Yeah. Well, you might be might not be joking actually. I don't know
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   Yeah, uh, you know, certainly you know what you could run a like a
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.880]   Wi-fi disruptor or something you could just shut down the net work. Yeah, you got it
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.760]   You got no live audience and no live stream
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.040]   uh, there are ways to absolutely prevent this and uh, you know, I mean it
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.960]   It's very it's very interesting. There are there are ways you can after the game and analyze it
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.400]   to
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.120]   Determine whether he played like a human believe it or not. That's a that's a whole story for now
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.920]   Can you well can you can you let me ask a different question
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.560]   can you
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.920]   A you find you don't cheat but you use a i to teach you new methods that no one kind of ever thought of before that
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.640]   Is that how you potentially find that's how all grandmasters now do it you can they do use a computer
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.800]   Away from the board and they all do that now. They use in fact. It's really this man machine
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.680]   Centaur like symbiosis
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.280]   Uh for all the best players, uh, you know, you always have with your uh super chan super grandmaster
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.160]   You have a entourage of two or three other lesser grandmasters who work with you
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.280]   To train to develop new lines to analyze your opponent patch on the back and bring you a towel stuff like that
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.960]   And right now computers are very much part of that and often on your team
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   You'll have somebody who is a computer chess expert who is also working with you on this
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.120]   So yeah computers have become a big part of it, but in a in a positive way
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.960]   Uh
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   I mean, you know, if you look if you can channel the computer you're gonna always win
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.240]   But what's the point that's yeah, that's not fun
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.360]   Uh, and it's it's it's one of the few human endeavors where a computer actually
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.720]   Is a hundred percent better than humans just
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.200]   You know
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.600]   It's done. It's over same at gesco is the same checkers a lot of a lot of games
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.920]   Anyway, i'm watching i'll be watching this with interest so you can continue how do you know? He's winning
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.520]   Uh the computer says he's got a 96.4
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   Chance to win you're cheating i thought you
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.160]   Uh actually i haven't really looked at it that hard. Uh, he's got a very strong
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.480]   He's niemen is black. He's got a very strong attack against white
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.960]   um
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   Doesn't look like he has a uh
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.920]   Material advantage. Well, I guess he does. He has he he's up what they call the exchange
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   He's like a pawn up
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.800]   But uh, yeah, the computer says he has very little chance of losing
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.240]   And almost a hundred percent chance of winning. There's his move. That's what it looks like. It's so exciting
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.360]   When they make us the Jarvis
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.520]   Yeah
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.600]   Really
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   I got one more question. Um
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.880]   So in terms of the of the butt plug
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.520]   um players
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.600]   Potentially move more than one part or I see you know he keeps his hand on until he decides
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.200]   Yeah, so it's what they call touch piece as soon as you touch a piece you're required to move it
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.760]   You can say that can you move back. Can you no hell no? What are you?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.080]   So why does he hold his hand on it for a second?
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.960]   Oh, yeah, he can move back, but he now has to move that piece
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:01.280]   Yes, he can it's you know what it's kind of the way sometimes they do that and if you were cheating you might do that as well to make
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.440]   That's what i'm saying. You're really thinking here's a choice. No, no the other way, right?
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.160]   Yeah, that was some of the other thing accusations where he seems so
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.680]   Carlston said he didn't didn't seem like he was paying attention
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   Usually if somebody's beating me they're working really hard to beat me
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.480]   And he didn't seem like he was you know doing anything. He was just kind of sitting there
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.520]   He's got a pretty strong game right now. He's uh, he's kind of moving in on this one. So that's a it's
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.640]   It's well. I don't like that statement of they look like they're working hard to beat me because
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.640]   Well, just as a fact just like saying everybody mourns the same way
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.720]   No, it's not like that because you if you were if your son's running an attract me
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   And the other guys are not sweating
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.920]   He's a robot
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   I mean there is no way to cheat and attract me well, I guess there are but
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.440]   Yeah, there are ways of the chief like eating these and so forth but some athletes, you know, they're just just
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.040]   Isomer cool. Yeah, yeah, no, that we're not talking that. I mean it
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.200]   There's you
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.640]   You know it's estimated these guys in a five four three four-hour match. That's how long they play usually as long as six hours
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.280]   Burn of you know like 3000 calories. It's and without moving
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.800]   It's yeah, there's a lot of brain activity mentally taxing very mentally taxing
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   And uh, and this attack which is going to come down the h
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.520]   File is going to be devastating for white's king and that's all I could say about that
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.880]   Two-year credit, sir. This is not this seduku you made us watch
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.360]   Is this better?
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:40.720]   Goodness. This is so much better than that. All of this. Yes, it is all of all played has simply been an attempt to avoid
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.920]   the elephant in the room
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.160]   But we're gonna take a break when we come back. Yes
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.600]   It looks like elan is buying twitter
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:57.360]   What the no, I'm I'm in mourning. I'm wearing black against uh, i'm wearing black every week
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.040]   There is a there's a lot to say about alpattini. I'm just glad I got a good night's sleep last night
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.240]   You know why I did thanks to my eight sleep
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.360]   pod cover
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.560]   Uh, our sponsor eight sleep actually i've been sleeping since before they were sponsored i've been sleeping on an eight sleep bed
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.800]   eight sleep
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.640]   brings you what you need which is a good night's sleep
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.840]   The pod I have the pod to pro cover
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.520]   The pod three just came out. It's the ultimate sleep machine
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.960]   You know this right consistent good sleep can help reduce the likelihood of serious health issues it can
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.800]   reduce the risk of heart disease lower your blood pressure
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.080]   There's even some evidence that it reduces the risk of alzheimer's
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.480]   And yet 30 percent of us more almost a third struggle
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:50.560]   With sleep. You know what the number one reason people say they have a point I sleep they're too hot at night
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.280]   Well with the eight sleep you'll never be too hot or too cold eight sleeps
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.000]   pod pro cover the one I have
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   Can cool your bed down as cool as 55 degrees fahrenheit
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:08.560]   Heat it up to 110 degrees fahrenheit and it does it using ai watching your sleep patterns
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:16.080]   To help you get more deep sleep. It's the only sleep technology that dynamically
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.280]   cools and heats each side of the bed
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.960]   To maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   And you know I know this because lisa's side is completely different from mine
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.280]   You start by setting it on your app the eight sleep app
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.800]   I set it to be warm when I get in I like to get in a cozy warm bed
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.320]   And then cool off as the night goes and actually that cooling brings you into deeper and deeper sleep
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.560]   This is a biological fact
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.760]   And then in the morning you can say I want to wake up at 8 a.m
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.360]   Or what our seven a.m
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.680]   And uh, I want to warm up slightly to wake me up
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   You can even have a vibrate if you want you can actually have a little bit of a silent alarm
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.440]   And I just wake up feeling great
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.360]   Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience a 19 percent increase in recovery up to 32
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.040]   Improvement in sleep quality up to 34 percent more deep sleep. The deep sleep is the key
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:11.280]   That's the sleep that that's actually doing the garbage collection cleaning up your brain with more deep sleep
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.000]   You'll be confident your mind and body are moving
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.480]   Through those restorative sleep stages is so vital for physical recovery
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.200]   hormone regulation mental clarity
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.680]   The pod probe cover actually watches the temperature of the bedroom too
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.480]   So when we were having that heat wave was really hot
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.000]   I said it was great. It was like air conditioning in my bed. It was so cool and refreshing
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.280]   In the dead of winter. It just nice and cozy and warming. It does it exactly the way you want
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.960]   I can't wait we're gonna I think I hope we will order this new pod three cover
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   You certainly should it enables more accurate sleep and health tracking because it has double the amount of sensors
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   So it's even even better
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.400]   Uh, I don't know. I mean the pod is not magic. I get it
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.600]   But it sure feels like it it makes such a difference in how you sleep

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.840]   Uh
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.840]   Wow, what a what a melodrama
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.520]   Is going on in twitter land
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.360]   Uh, I almost I hardly don't know where to begin so
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   Yesterday news came
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.000]   That elan must had sent a letter to twitter
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.800]   to the twitter board and
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.880]   They said to the judge
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.120]   Saying
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.640]   Okay, okay fine. I'll buy it 54 20 a share 44 billion dollars
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.720]   Uh
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.360]   People seem to act like okay, that's it. It's a done deal, but it is pending
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   the ending of the court
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.600]   Trial which was supposed to begin in a little couple of weeks october 17th
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.760]   Uh
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.680]   The judge today said I haven't heard anything yet. So we're going to move ahead
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.160]   There's some speculation that the reason elan cried uncle is
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.200]   He's supposed he's being deposed tomorrow
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.400]   So he would be called to testify under oath tomorrow in a deposition
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.120]   the other possible
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.200]   Sword hanging over his head is the release of additional messages
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.400]   Between musk and others there was a tranche of messages released last week that were I think
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.720]   Not so embarrassing for elan, but pretty embarrassing for the sick for the sick of fans like jason calicannis
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.920]   Calicannis it was it was perfect. I can't wait to get to that. It was just perfect. I love Jason
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.400]   He's been there for as many times. Oh no no it was the essence of Jason
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.640]   Uh, he was a little bit of a suck up this week in jason
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.680]   Yeah, a little bit of a suck. So first he volunteers now you remember one of the things
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.600]   You know after elan made the bid he he scrambled to raise the money
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   He borrowed quite a bit against his tesla stock
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.680]   But even that even though he's the richest man in the world was not enough to cover the 44 billion
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.640]   Larry ellison the richest man in the moord world
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:39.200]   He sure was is he is he no one isn't the tata tata guy? Oh, I think the tata guy might have come on
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.680]   I don't know, you know tesla stock is plummeted
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.240]   But at the time he was the richest man in the world
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.200]   He was the richest man in the world
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.240]   But again, but that actually points out how little it means it's not like, you know, scrooge mcduck
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.720]   He's got a swimming pool full of dollar bills
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.280]   It's it's all tied up and tesla stock and it's all because of this value tesla stock
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:03.040]   And incidentally can I just say elan did an amazing thing space x did amazing thing this morning
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.160]   You watch that john. I know I did nine a.m
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:11.600]   Uh, the falcon uh dragon crew five six went up five
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:17.280]   Uh with four astronauts one from russia one from japan two from the us including a petaloumen
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.760]   The commander was a native american born here in petalouma went to rancha katadi high down the road
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.680]   And yeah, yeah, isn't that where you're is that where your kids went? It's rancha katadi it's yeah
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   uh
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.720]   Uh, she was the commander first native american in space
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.640]   Uh, yeah, really it was a beautiful launch flawless
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.800]   the uh the
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.040]   So booster landed on the on that instead on the drone platform
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.680]   Well, I gotta point out
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.640]   SpaceX's success is not necessarily
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.280]   Dude elan might be despite elan. There are a number of space x employees who say i've said before it's just a
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:04.000]   Disseptuous of something like space x could be because elan put the right people in place to make this stuff
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.600]   Yeah, you've been saying that regularly and yes
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:16.640]   Uh in any event well done so that and i i'm rit me should i mention is i i just don't want to like say elan is just the most horrible person in the world
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.880]   He's an ami- i will
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.840]   I don't think he's horrible. I think he's like a lot of billionaires. Yes i think he has a higher self opinion
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.240]   His ukraine trick last week was was horrendous. It was horrendous
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.080]   He said oh they should just have a vote in russia, you know should get
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.800]   You know, whatever it gets
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:40.400]   And by the way, uh, you know what the foreign minister of the ukraine called him a bad word
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:47.920]   Yeah, and zalensky tweeted back at him. I mean this is and by the way today the russian said hey good idea
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:56.000]   Right, that's a great idea elan and i wonder is there per chance between that and he got kind of them sort of his room
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.800]   Not even reward i'm not i'm just asking because you know, we know there's souty money in this field could there be russian
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.040]   Actually, i think the biggest
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:10.960]   Third party in this is the souty, uh, sovereign funds. Yes. Uh, as we know from the revealed text messages
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.880]   Uh larry elison dm zim and says i'm in what do you want a billion to you tell me?
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.400]   No, he said a billion and elan then said no to
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.920]   And and larry went along with it. Yeah, uh
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.080]   Jason says jason calicana says hey i'd like to be the ceo if you don't mind i have some great ideas
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.720]   And he fires off message after message about how twitter should be run
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.360]   And at the same time and i got the email sends out emails to people saying hey
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.840]   i'm building a group of people who will help elan in this acquisition we give him some money would you be interested?
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.400]   Uh elan
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:53.280]   Eventually is compelled to say can you knock it off? This is proving embarrassing
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.320]   To me
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.600]   Um, I didn't see i think really embarrassing from elan i was mostly the sick of fans kissing up to him
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.480]   Jason eventually says i'm carrying your sword sir
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.920]   I'm just it was just awful. It was awful
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.480]   The ultimate jason
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   Uh, you know what jason's not jason doesn't know how to be embarrassed
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.400]   No, no bother him. No, he's no i love jason and you know he's always
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.680]   Uh said that he was good friends with elan when i bought the model
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.760]   Uh, ex he said i get you at the head of the line
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:29.920]   Uh, he didn't but you know i you know he knows elan, you know he had a model he had a roadster. He is he knows elan
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.600]   Uh twitter meanwhile has really been rocked by this whole thing 700 employees have left
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.360]   Uh some two major executives were fired
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.600]   Um the board major talent just left major talent the board
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.200]   Uh
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.840]   Is now very active in pursuing elan making him do it including there's a big article about bret taylor our guy bret
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.520]   We love bret uh, he was a chairman of the board who is on the committee that is pursuing this litigation
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.600]   Uh, the other shoe that might drop is
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.400]   additional messages
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:09.200]   Except it looks like elan moved the important ones to signal
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.680]   And but said he wasn't using signal for the deal, but they have
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.080]   one smoking gun
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.080]   not plug
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.560]   Uh showing that he was moving to conversation to signal so they've got him there too
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:29.520]   The conversation they really want to know about is did he comfort talk with the twitter whistle blower peters that co
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.800]   Before he whistled blue in other words that did he maybe encourage him
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.600]   Uh to do this
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.040]   Apparently someone with an anonymous proton mail account. That's an encrypted email account
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.000]   on the same
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   on may 6th
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:56.560]   Send an email. He he said I am a former exec at twitter leading teams directly involving trust and safety content moderation
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.200]   in the email the sender
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.280]   Is it zacko? We don't know
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.840]   Suggest that musk's team get in touch on another platform form through quote alternate secure means
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.720]   In order for this person to provide information about twitter
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.600]   It's not probative, but I think it's much it's peters echo
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.440]   Um and that he did in fact approach
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.160]   Elon saying I got something you might want to know
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:30.320]   Uh this could also be a reason eelon might have said you know this is the
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.400]   Guess is is are that eelon knew he was going to lose. I don't know if that's the case. Can I ask a question here?
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.240]   Is so so so lose would be defined as you must buy the company
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:47.040]   Yeah, is there also a definition of lose that says you were such a bad boy eelon
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:52.640]   You not only buy the company you fork up another five billion to injured parties
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.280]   I don't think so is there punishment? No, I don't think loses just by it
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.720]   I think loses by it, but along the way a lot of damage in discovery
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.960]   And this happens again and again this happened in epic versus apple
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:14.400]   Uh where the discovery of all of this stuff pre trial is embarrassing as hell to these companies
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.960]   Apple suffered a lot of reputational damage. They won the case against epic, but they lost a lot of reputation
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.320]   Because of the messages, uh, you know, we'll be quoting those messages for years to come
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.440]   Um, it just happens again and again and again and I think already
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.040]   It's been a somewhat of an embarrassment, but if if messages between zacko and musk
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.920]   before the whistle blowing
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.840]   showed up
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.840]   That would be bad
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.920]   um
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.920]   Anyway, uh
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.560]   For whatever reason and and it's you know, it's all 12d chess
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.880]   Maybe could be checkers, but for whatever reason
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   Uh, eelon said no, let's buy it now. They his lawyers have still not
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.400]   Apparently told the judge at least the judge hadn't received that information
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.480]   So she said we're going to act as if we
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.160]   Are the trials still on for the 17th? So I'm not sure what's going on
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.320]   The judge right before the musk letter did say twitter could hunt for secret chats with zacko
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.640]   Um
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.040]   Do you think there are any see go ahead of the the regulators come in. Uh, what is it the the scc?
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.640]   Scc
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:34.000]   Yeah, do you think we'll ever see any of them come in and say look here dude you eat you need to pay for these problems
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.400]   You've created musk. I think is
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.640]   Trying to I did he not go to appeal to the supreme court
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:47.200]   Uh, I think he I feel like he did over this issue of whether the scc
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.080]   Should be allowed
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.480]   Uh to muzzle him
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.240]   Uh, I think the supreme court rejected that by the way
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.960]   um
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.480]   He the scc is you know, I think really should definitely get involved
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.040]   I don't know what the current status of their investigations are
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.360]   Um, you know, they have a good sent to agree with him
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:19.920]   Sorry, she doesn't is there any scenario in which he doesn't get the company. Oh, absolutely. I mean who the hell knows
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.960]   who the what
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yeah, well for one thing one of the
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.200]   Conditions of this letter was that the case be dropped
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.040]   But why would you drop it until such time as you well?
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.560]   I don't know who has I guess twitter has to
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.840]   Contact the judge the judge doesn't have an or anything
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:49.040]   Well, twitter's statement was as as mike maznik said who I was with yesterday. Um when all this happened. Um,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.760]   This was probably the most lawyer
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.120]   Message in a year
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   Um in which twitter just said we intend to close
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.640]   Yeah
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.960]   Period. Yeah, yeah, period period
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   Love it. Um, so the judge needs to get word that twitter's dropping its lawsuit, but he's nylon also suing
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:15.120]   So both that's right. There's a counter search. Both parties have to tell
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.240]   the judge
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:22.080]   That uh, they're gonna drop the case apparently that has not happened
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.680]   Well twitter would be a fool to do that until they know that the financing. Well, that's the condition
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.640]   Yeah, well, that's that's it's a bit chicken niggie. He ain't it
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   Because i'm not gonna. Are you first? No, you first
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.960]   Um
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.880]   You you drop the suit. No, you close the deal. Well, no, i'm not closing the deal to drop the suit
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.960]   No, you drop the suit. I mean, that's is that where he arse a simple nieni nieni game
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:55.040]   Uh, maznik says he thinks uh, ylon will own twitter. Let's go forward assuming he will and then it'll happen. Yeah quickly
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.160]   Okay, now I know what you're gonna answer that question is
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.120]   I was gonna say what do you think? Um
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.040]   So
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.000]   I like mr. Elgin's commentary. Yeah, let's let's go to that because that's it was a great piece. So, uh,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.280]   It won't happen overnight. It'll take a month or two
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.080]   To close it's kind of unknown
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:25.040]   Whether uh, there might be regulatory approval and so forth. I don't know. It's just a purchase of a company
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.080]   Elan's not in the social network business. So
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:35.680]   I guess uh, there probably wouldn't be regulatory hold-ups, right
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.640]   Anyway, it's a it's a kind of a rocket ship. It would be a kite
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.960]   Be soon it'd be within a month or two. So what happens? Yeah
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:50.560]   Well, i'm sure someone right now. Oh, go on. No, no, no. I want to hear from you
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.120]   Well, no, I was just gonna say i'm sure someone right now is trying to build something that could
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.400]   Take a mass exodus from twitter. Yes. I mean, I think what happens is we're gonna show that in a minute
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:06.640]   I was part of that conversation just yesterday. I think that's not the only one, but you're right
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   I'm sure that's yes, that's one thing is
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.400]   I mean, of course a minute elan closes on twitter
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.720]   I would i'm not gonna leave twitter. Are you gonna would you leave twitter's? They see if just because elan closed on it
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.760]   Not right away, but I mean I imagine
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:30.240]   I think the way elan ends up managing twitter might make it a less hospitable place for someone like myself
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.320]   Yes, my but might not
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.600]   And so i'm like yeah when that happens. I will exactly that's my attitude. I'm gonna find to see what happens
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.480]   Your state would have to give me on andrey brought jr
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.560]   Sorry, i have to go ahead
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.840]   No, i was saying he would have to give me a reason to leave i know a lot of folks
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:53.120]   On twitter right now or just throwing their hands up like oh this we can't let this happen
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:00.480]   blah blah blah but what if he actually comes in and does a decent job of putting people in place and helping to
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.560]   curtail the
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   Crap fest that's happening inside of twitter from elan i don't think that's gonna happen
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.800]   elan has a lot of ideas he hasn't demonstrated much command of the
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:16.640]   Space, you know like he really is the best case the best case is that it's no worse than it is today
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.520]   That is by far the best case well chris and everything else is done. Oh the guy
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.080]   Do it do it in a snotty accent. Will you the guy who found it?
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.600]   Ted talks
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.080]   Chris i know you found them. He did not found them
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.640]   He did not find it because i know who founded it uh, yes, saw uh saw wormen right?
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.280]   wormen
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.000]   Yep way back when technology entertainment design
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.560]   Uh, but he currently runs Ted right chris. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.360]   So he uh tweeted admits to all the sneering. How does he talk?
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.400]   very very uh
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.600]   I'd like to offer a prediction for how the elan mosque acquisition of twitter will play out
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.400]   First of all, i'm sorry
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.760]   I think the deal will indeed go through now. I regret it
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.080]   Bagged by an impressive roster of co-investors
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.000]   Next the company will undoubtedly like like by the way
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.720]   Saudi Arabia, but keep going well, but you know if you're gonna paint with that brush a lot of silicon valleys
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.920]   Paper with Saudi money. I mean, I know this I know sovereign fund is very
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.800]   At-howerful in Silicon Valley, which we should probably at some point talk about
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.840]   Uh, so whatever impressive
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.400]   roster of co-investors is unnecessarily ask his seat, but okay, we'll say
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.640]   Uh
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:43.280]   But that's kind of the whole point of this piece. I think the company will undoubtedly experience a period of significant turmoil the
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.840]   Because like everybody's gonna quit. There's a lot of change ahead many won't like it
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:56.160]   But here's the but you're looking for Stacy. It will gradually become clear that a lot of the changes are actually quite exciting
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.520]   First of all fears of all the content moderation being abandoned will prove unfounded
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:09.200]   Instead the algorithm will be adjusted to avoid giving so much amplification to political divisiveness actually that sounds good to me
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.200]   Yeah, and he can't get rid of content moderation whatever he says because that would turn the place into a cesspool
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.960]   Um, but you know he said he even vied Donald trump back. That's well right there
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:28.240]   Whether the Donald will go back. I don't know but you know if you're gonna downplay political divisiveness and fighting
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.720]   the head of the political divisive party
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.760]   It's not
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:38.640]   The best way to do it the debate that matters is not about who is on or off the platform Anderson says but what type of tweets get amplified
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   You know some of that's in twitter's control, but some of it's not it's retweeting. It's not it's press coverage
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Yeah, if that can change everything changes next steps will be put into place to verify all
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.760]   human twitter accounts
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:58:00.160]   Blue checks for all that process will lay the basis for those accounts to be used for oh get ready for this
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:06.960]   Transactions a la we chat using it here we go twitter. This is this is the x
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:13.360]   This is there. This is his dream that he's gonna be we chat and he's gonna do what china does from the base of twitter
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:19.520]   And how much do you have to invest to do that twitter says elan says he's going to use twitter to build an everything app
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:27.840]   Called x buying twitter is an accelerant using that space language to creating x the everything app mike
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.920]   We'll talk about mike elgan's explanation of what that x is in just a second, but let's finish chris sanderson's
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.640]   lengthy tweet
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:42.080]   For example people might by the way could be a twitter crypto coin or us dollars
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   For example people how old fashioned you have house financial. Oh my well actually this makes more sense this next paragraph people may be offered paid subscriptions
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.640]   And receive usable tokens so you pay them five bucks and they give you 500 twitter dollars
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.240]   This could be a slam this could bring the company's significant i second that size stacy
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:10.320]   Plus i don't need monopoly money on my social networks. Yeah, but it is all the rage isn't it?
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:15.360]   This is such although nft sales have plummeted since the beginning of the year
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.480]   They've just paid falling off the map which is tough for people who are holding those valuable
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.840]   moonbirds monkeys monkeys
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.600]   Four napes four napes four napes that's what it is
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:32.880]   So this paid subscriptions for usable tokens could bring the company significant revenue
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:40.160]   Plus get this create its own economy on which goods and services could be transacted the sheer
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.760]   Scale of twitter can rapidly bring this to critical mass
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:50.720]   But get ready that facial expression sacy we're not done there's more for me
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.320]   but but then wait
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.480]   September
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   September 2023
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.520]   Growing numbers of people will be attracted to twitter x
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.000]   It will be far less prone to robo spam and algorithm fueled outrage
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.240]   Magic well how you'll be a magic just it's gonna be no more because web three because magic
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.680]   Because the chain instead it will offer a lot of new functionality that could be that could be true elan could do that
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.480]   I don't know we this is hold on do you know how long this is the pain the final bit the
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.880]   How do you pronounce that pay pain pian to elan
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:38.240]   Pay on pay on there is plenty elan must can be legitimately criticized for his own use of twitter
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.560]   Can scheme ill-advised he can give the impression of being more
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.120]   Politically than political than he is and there's no question that mean
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.800]   Apparently he's not political. We didn't know and there's no question
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.000]   He's just a jerk and gets upset when people call him political
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.120]   Yeah, I mean that's it's people who are like i'm not political. They just that are the most
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.040]   Right. Yes. Yes. Oh, i'm not political i'm just right
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.960]   And there's no question there will be many bumps along the way says hannorson
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.840]   But this is the key point as a tech entrepreneur. He is without peer
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.480]   in 2013
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.960]   I predicted he would become the world's richest man within a decade
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.280]   Oh
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.520]   Check check the next day. That's his check not mine. The next decade will be even more
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.200]   Spectacular
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.080]   Fixing twitter may be as hard a job as converting Teslas into robo taxis
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.320]   Still hasn't happened and proving the viability of a monster rocket capable of taking humanity to the mars
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.520]   Still hasn't happened, but within three days three years from today. I predict he will have accomplished all three
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.480]   Hey, there you go. Put that down. Would you put that in the book there aunt?
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.240]   Uh got it tesla robo taxis rockets to mars and he fixed twitter
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.120]   And let's not forget the rears tubes under america. Yeah
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.840]   Not a not investment advice just one person's opinion now pass me the popcorn your thoughts miss
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.480]   freaking buff him
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:17.040]   The turning twitter into an everything up. I think that's a really great idea
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.840]   the challenge is it is
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.120]   Difficult in a way that elan can't engineer around and you know
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:31.840]   I don't know if elan's coming up with these ideas or his he's inspiring his engineering staff to really work hard at some things
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:38.480]   There's some really cool things that I will give elan or the companies that elan is heading a lot of credit for
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.200]   I mean, yes, we can mock the lack of robo taxis
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.840]   but you know when you sat up for his engineering thing for the
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.640]   The optimist robot in the way he's approaching ai training
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.840]   That actually there's a really interesting science and some really big bets on their computing platform that i'm like, hey
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.280]   That's actually legit and pretty cool. But the robot was BS right?
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   when it comes
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.520]   The robot itself
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.000]   I don't think there'll be a full functioning robot like he anticipates in like what six months or nine months. I can't remember
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.320]   Um, it was very late. I was on a plane
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.600]   But back to x in this concept of twitter is everything up
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.640]   the problem is payments and
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.440]   apple spent
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:28.800]   Like almost eight years working on getting payments and they're just now hitting their stride when like apple pay and that sort of thing
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.640]   and
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.360]   I think and elan knows this he was at paypal. I think
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.440]   getting
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.280]   An everything app and having the payments as part of the app because you would have to have some sort of agreement with credit card companies
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   I don't think
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.440]   Anyone can reinvent that space. We've seen so many people try and
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.360]   Or miss that's where i have in history at paypal
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.800]   Do you not think he has a bit of a head start and being able to see what apple went through?
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.280]   Do you not think that's some head start knowledge for him to try to put stuff in place?
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.240]   I feel like he knows how hard it is
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.960]   I also feel like apple went up out it from a different angle than paypal folks did right so I feel like
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   If even if he's able to do that he's not going to be able to do that for years
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.080]   And there's not really a good
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:28.800]   Way to do it quickly and it's not an engineering issue. It is a business issue and
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.840]   Yeah, you gotta replace the entire credit card infrastructure
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.240]   Of the country you've got to convince every merchant to come on and accept payment this way
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.000]   You've got to add all kinds of functionality and change consumer habits about how they do everything
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.840]   China can do it because they have a monopoly government over monopoly businesses that ain't the case here that not happen not happen
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:05:00.320]   Yeah, and China also didn't have the credit card infrastructure and the payment infrastructure going into it
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.080]   So, so when I when I think about things like that, I'm like
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.280]   I think elan
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.800]   probably is good at recognizing his 10x way to solve a problem and
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:21.280]   galvanizing engineers to solve that problem even if you know, but I don't think payments in creating the everything app is probably the way to
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.080]   That that's not that type of problem
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.880]   So that's that's my my take there in
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.920]   I mean, I don't know. I mean
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.520]   He doesn't want this. I feel like I
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:40.640]   Yeah, I really don't understand. I mean, I think he does. Maybe the best case. I think he does now. I think he's chan once again
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.160]   He's he's completely flip-flopped on this. He seems
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.680]   That's all he really wants it as long as he goes. So our best case is he prides someone who
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:57.120]   Does want this if he finds someone who's willing to do it and does want to dig into this. I think it could be fine
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.640]   Um because it's not like the twitter folks were really doing a bang up job, right?
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   You know, they were just kind of mucking along trying some stuff, but it was
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.160]   So there's there's actually the potential for someone to be appointed to do something really great with it. Yeah
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   But I would prefer
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.480]   Yeah, I would prefer this mode of eight people
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.360]   I want to see this turbocharged blue sky and other alternatives
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.640]   I want to see
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.000]   This put up a bat signal to scare people that as jack has said twitter shouldn't be a company
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.160]   It should be a protocol and what does
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:40.640]   Speech as protocol look like with value added layers atop this. I think that's an odd starter
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.040]   I think that's even harder to do than a than a siloed. I mean, I hate to say it. I fart discord discord stars down that path
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.200]   Well, yeah, but this court's not taking over the world. I think as a protocol
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.680]   I think that I agree with you jeff
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.920]   I prefer to see it that way, but honestly the way to financial riches look
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.320]   He's got a he's got to get make up 44 billion dollars. Oh, I'm not saying needle on does this
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.560]   I'm saying that this scares everybody else to get their acts together to do something
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.040]   Well, that's that's the conversation yesterday yesterday when this came out. People weren't scared by facebook
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.880]   I mean honestly
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.400]   This is this has been waiting for somebody to do and lots of tried for a decade
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.960]   And nobody nobody has
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.720]   And I think there's the network effect
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.920]   There's a lot of strong reasons why it's almost impossible at this point to build a comp competitor
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   I think elan has absolutely the inside track to create an everything app
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.720]   I mean if he requires twitter. He's got the inside track. It's not going to be an open standard
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.560]   It's going to be a siloed
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.040]   You know you have to buy into it. He's going to have to somehow get people to go for it
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.720]   I don't think it's going to be easy thing to do
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.000]   He's going to have to invest three times what it costs to buy twitter
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.480]   Maybe but you know if honestly if the financial markets thought that he had a shot at it
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.520]   Look how much money they poured into uber and we work
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.320]   I mean if they thought he had a shot at it
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.040]   He would have no trouble raising the money in fact. I think he has had no trouble so far
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.200]   He's probably pitching this idea
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.520]   And has been for some time there
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.040]   I mean it's clear to see what the upside would be of such a thing if you could do it
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.440]   The fact that facebook hasn't done it
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.640]   I mean facebook's tried that apple has I don't think apple's really tried
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.720]   But I think apples sensibly just you know stood and looked over the precipice instead step back a little bit
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.080]   Uh facebook's tried though. They wanted to turn messenger into the every which which says everything about how difficult it is
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:35.200]   I don't think it's easy. Yeah, no not at all and and and you know, I wouldn't be so
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.240]   I think there's another scenario here because jack has been to my surprise
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.880]   um
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.520]   Seemingly an elan ally in this which says a lot about his relationship with the company
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.160]   I'm sure that's part of it, but it's also about blue sky
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.680]   And and elan has saluted that flag a bit and blue sky is five million dollars funny
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.120]   It's all they have right now in four people but jay graber's release smart
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.080]   Um, there's there's something there
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.440]   Where if if if jack could convince elan that the future was
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.040]   as a protocol like a word press
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.720]   um
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.400]   Open source base
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.240]   Upon which you can build great value and build it faster as a result
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.600]   Then interesting things could happen jack could be a key to this to pushing elan in the right direction
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.080]   Everybody knows that's not where the money is the money is where cori doctor ro and rebecca gud the money ate and twitter
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.320]   No, they don't take that choke point. So elism you you're the money is in controlling
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.400]   The is siloed. It's not an open anything open is the antithesis is where we love open
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.040]   But open is not the way to make billions
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.360]   That's not true open can be used to make billionaires. It just needs to be open
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.640]   The the lower like android android and where it's not open. Are you kidding?
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.480]   Like look at the intel architecture that isn't open
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.160]   But it's at a low enough level and then intel spent a lot of money
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.640]   And I think it's also important they recognize that it was a platform and designed it as such
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.280]   So you can design yourself to be like a walled garden or you can be a platform
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.960]   And I think that's
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.040]   And I say intel because like look at what intel did they were like oh crap
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.680]   We've got a computing platform. We need more people to use it. So they funded you know EA
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.760]   They funded all these companies who are like
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   Heck yeah use our computing platform
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.520]   Contrast that with something like the
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.840]   Carriers who are like oh man broadband's amazing. They're gonna build a whole economy on this
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   Let's charge them for every freaking penny and then let's charge them to a floor and that like
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.640]   That's stymied the ecosystem till we found ways around it. So I think there's
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.680]   There's a difference
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.160]   And I appreciate what Corey is saying with choke point capitals
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.080]   And I think most companies try to veer towards the the carrier kind of model
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.600]   But I think there's a lot of value in recognizing and creating a platform
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.800]   That allows enough people to make enough money off of it. Mm-hmm. That
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.600]   That allows you to build out something that's really cool and literally does
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.400]   Like I slipped all boats or whatever that phrase is
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.160]   That makes no of course i'm all for it
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.080]   But that's not what concentrates a billion dollars in the hands of one person
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:34.400]   And that's what you want wants to do so be clear. I am all about open. That's fantastic
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.520]   Intel made a but ton of money during their heyday
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.960]   Yep, because they had I mean because they had an open architecture. They didn't have an open architecture
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.480]   They made it was it no they made a platform opener
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:52.240]   It was a platform as opposed to a platform is not open. That's not an open platform
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.760]   I know i'm not saying you need to be open you need to have a mindset
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.720]   He needs to make a platform builds on top of your people
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:05.280]   That's what he was he was he was putting a platform absolutely, but that's not federated green open
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.760]   No, but there are there are middle grounds there are middle grounds and blue sky could be a means of of that where you tie another
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.440]   There's another scenario here, which is that he buys it anybody with any talent leaves
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.520]   He doesn't know what the hell he's doing
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.160]   uh, he turns it into the true cesspool people call it now when it isn't and
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:31.120]   The value goes down and down and down and down and loans get called and other problems can haul and this could be the ruin of elan musk
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.520]   That's another scenario
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.480]   I think that's probably more likely but I i'm rooting for him look if he's gonna take twitter over
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.600]   I want him to succeed because I don't want twitter to go away
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.680]   That's like saying we still salute donald trump because he's president at some point
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.880]   Uh, he believe who people people are when they tell you
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.640]   Well, he showed us are we down talking about you and and again
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.480]   Uh, I think we are. Let me see is there anything else
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:04.560]   That we in that rundown that we care about i'd be curious if your audience if anybody your audience is use planetary
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:11.200]   um, which is something you and uh, look I was with i was with mike mastic yesterday
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.240]   i'm a fanboy mike I finally got to meet mike in person and with daphne keller who's a brilliant
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:23.280]   uh legal scholar at stanford on internet stuff and somebody named um golda velles who was there and we
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.240]   This news happened while we were talking together at lunch at this conference
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.400]   And so mike brought up planetary and said you know he showed her to be said look it looks exactly like twitter
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.440]   It's got to head start and and and golda was saying that the key is being able to export
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.040]   um
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.360]   Your graph from the likes of twitter and apparently you can do that
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.960]   No, you can export it to other people using that
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.560]   Planetary well, but that's the question. That's the question is where does that look is you know, is there any?
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:59.760]   Uh exit strategy that works. Why do they keep reinventing this? I mean look we had new social because we've had this ruined
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.480]   No, no, but we we've had oh, I said the the the the the we have this we have
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.280]   Open an open standard for this. There's no reason in mass design, right?
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.160]   Well massed on is one instance but there's more than in fact, I don't know if you know about pixel fed
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.440]   Do you know pixel fed which is a massed on instagram?
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:25.600]   Photo sharing clone. It's based on massed on it's open. There are a lot of there's you know, it started way back when
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.400]   um with um
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.080]   Well, the canoe social and before canoe social was identical
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:40.080]   I don't know if you remember that but this is a well-known well supported strong open standard massed on as just one instance of it
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.240]   But and I love massed and I we've been running on a massed on instance for years
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.600]   It's not the next it's not taken over
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:54.640]   It's not it's not it's not you know, I mean I don't I don't understand why you think let's create another one
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.200]   Is gonna solve that?
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.560]   Uh, there i'm just saying the time just has to be right
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.560]   Exactly. There's a crisis now and none of these companies is forever, right?
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.440]   Friend feed did not take over the world my space did not take over the world twitter facebook and even google are not forever companies
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.960]   And there's nothing to say that something could come along the problem is they can't just replicate what was they've got to improve upon it
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.440]   and um
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   You know, we heard matt maulin wigs
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.400]   Uh strategy a few weeks ago and he's now serving 40 of the web
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.960]   Very quietly by doing the open structure by building a true platform
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.920]   There are examples of succeeding that way and matt's plenty successful not as rich as elan no, but he's doing very well
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.920]   I would submit that's not the kind of success elan's going for I don't care what elan wants
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.200]   I don't give a damn what he should on once well. I I just point out that he's not gonna do anything elan doesn't want
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.600]   Right and so that's why I do think we've got to start looking for alternatives. Okay. Yeah, that's what i'm saying
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.960]   It's he's gonna. He's he's an idiot. You're saying that twitter is really you're saying twitter is over the minute he takes over
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.480]   I fear that i'm not going to leave. I was starting to say before
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   I greatly admire and I mentioned mom on the show often and andrew brock jr
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.640]   Who wrote distributed blackness and and I don't know I just looked at his feed
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.800]   And I haven't seen any late any comments lately, but after the holy lot of things started
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.240]   He said basically you're gonna get us out of here with dynamite because we have something now we build it now
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.040]   And it's not public for the world to see right it's it's the twitter that he talks about
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.720]   Exists in in in its own world and as long as it can it can survive there
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.760]   Um like leviv in the ukraine war then fine keep going
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.080]   And and that's the way I look at twitter now. I think it's what we've all just said as long as it doesn't get too awful
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.760]   We've got a lot of invested in there. We're gonna stick for now, but i'm afraid that it could get really awful
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:56.240]   I just struck me that when you met with them yesterday in the person, who did you say showed you this planetary that social like mastic
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.640]   Like mastic. Okay. So so when mr. Masnick showed it to you or the words that if his mouth
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:08.640]   Is just like twitter no no no no he was he was saying that there's that rabbel the guy who started uh planetary
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.280]   Has a more a far more open
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.680]   Unalgorithmic view of social and mike just said by the way it kind of looks like twitter that was all
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.320]   Um, okay, but as far as alternatives and and where are if we were to export our graphs somewhere
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:30.880]   Where might there be open homes for them? I don't know can discord take that and take all my friends
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.040]   Um can can planetary
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:40.320]   Is there a is there a friendly repository where I where we can start to rebuild after the nuclear bomb that elon drops on our social
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.320]   You can't do that if you think of your social web like a community and if you view this as being a bomb
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.240]   Brought you can't bring your entire community with you when you go. No, I mean, so you just have to accept like this
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.040]   Now
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.400]   Well, no, you could just be like i'm gonna build a new community here and I think that kind of idea of
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.720]   if you view like your virtual life and your virtual relationships
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.600]   In parallel to your cute like real world world ones
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.800]   You know if you move away or your friends move away or you leave college for example
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.440]   This might be like leaving college everybody goes to their own platforms and that was nice and you'll make new friends
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.400]   Yeah, I mean it happened with my space. It's happened before
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.440]   Um, I doesn't like the idea of someone
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.400]   proposing a new app or service or whatever and the first things out of their mouth is
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.320]   It is just like twitter. Well, then no, no, I'm not just a
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.040]   I don't want to planetary didn't say that like didn't say that although it is just like twitter
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.800]   I'm saying but I mean, it's not exactly innovating now. What they use. There's a lot of competitors are using that type
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.280]   of verbiage where they'd be a twitter
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:54.800]   Local like or whatever on instagram look at like or you know everybody's sort of saying hey, this is our version of twitter
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.880]   Well, if it's twitter then just stay there, you know
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:07.520]   Um, yeah, it's it's it's it's an ancillary to the discussion about why does everybody start tick-tock when there's tick-tock
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:14.080]   Yeah, the the competitive response is that everybody copies everybody rather than everybody out innovates everybody
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.000]   And that's where we are right now. You know, I think it's the same thing and where
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   You know, there's a whole list of things are getting killed every week
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.680]   Google's killing them and others are killing them and I think we're seeing you know, facebook is a sad retrenchment right now
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.480]   twitter god knows where this fate is in the next month
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:35.360]   Um google is killing stuff and is not and leo has been saying this for a long time
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.240]   But now i'll agree with him that it's not showing itself to be wildly innovative
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.440]   Um, the now legacy companies of the internet are getting to be kind of sad
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.320]   And I don't think that the future is necessarily new big companies
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.680]   Well, but that that that's that's a point well taken which is the you're certainly not going to innovate by copying what exists
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.360]   I agree. That's what i'm saying and I think that's where we are now. I think we're in it. We're in a
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.600]   Um, it's like the phones. There's not really any innovation going on with the phones right now
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.960]   There there are incremental improvements and I think the internet
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:11.600]   Uh, and how it works is incremental improvements, but I think you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna do a gutenberg moment folks a book coming up next June
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:18.640]   Um, it was 150 years after movable type before you got the essay the novel and the newspaper
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.320]   And and I think that we're in a stagnant time
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.000]   Of not understanding what we can be and there's going to be my students. Maybe we'll be the ones who
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.840]   Surprise us and i'll be long gone. I want you to read kori's book
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:35.040]   You got to read chokepoint capitalism. I'd love to get your
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.040]   Opinion on it
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:43.280]   Because I think kori and his co-author rebecca gillman have set out a very good description of why
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.920]   We are at this stage
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.960]   We're at a stage. Yeah, but but i don't think they're quite a sanguine about breakable the
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:59.760]   End results as you are. It's a really good book and a chokepoint capitalism highly recommended. I also want to give credit to cathleen
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.400]   Uh, st. j mccormack
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.360]   I don't know what the st. j stands for who is the judge at the dellaware chance record because I think she's actually been
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.720]   Kind of savvy it was her decision
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.920]   to release all those messages
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.160]   uh
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.160]   And I think
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.360]   That was a kind of a savvy move to kick elan in the butt that worked
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:32.160]   That was a little a little a you know, we got more messages we could release elan because of course it's in her interest
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.320]   As it would be for any court to get these parties to settle before they go to court
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:43.760]   And what better way to get elan off his duff than say, you know, we got these messages and we're going to have more
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.360]   He published him great piece in blunberg by the way on the one person
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:56.560]   Who did not embarrass himself in the texts and that's par wag parag agro wall
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.800]   Well victim who's going to get 40 million dollars plus as his as his golden handcuffs, but he stayed out of it
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.960]   He he you know, even jack dorsey got in the middle
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.320]   agro wall
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.760]   Just you know
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   Suck quiet. He said
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.840]   I'm super excited about the opportunity looking forward to working closely and finding ways
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.840]   To use your time as effectively as possible improve twitter and the public conversation
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.560]   Great message to elan that's you know, they had a couple of back and forths
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.320]   But agro wall at every point in state classy
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:40.160]   Uh elan texted him april fifth would be great to unwind permanent bans
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:47.440]   You know that is except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence agro wall agro
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.400]   I don't know. I have such a hard time saying agro wall agro wall did not respond
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.640]   Yeah, let that sit there. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:07.440]   Um instead agro wall invites must to talk about his specific technical ideas asking him to treat me like an engineer instead of ceo
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.640]   I promise i'll evaluate proposals neutrally
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.680]   I want to hear all the ideas and i'll tell you which ones will make progress on versus not
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:23.120]   And why in other words he stayed classy man. Yeah, so so in all of this props to two people
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.720]   uh
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:29.200]   Parag agro all the uh seat current ceo. I would say interim ceo
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.440]   of twitter
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.560]   and uh the judge cathaleen mccormack who
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   I think pulled off a pretty savvy coup that worked
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.360]   By releasing at least this first tranche of messages and saying they are more to come
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:50.800]   I think I can channel stacey right now to say we've done elan. We are done. I tried to end it a while ago
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.000]   Uh, we are done. We are done. We have we gotta talk about stadia. We haven't even gotten to stadia
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.920]   But first let me tell you speaking of dead things about speaking of dead things about our sponsor secure works

[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:07.820]   Well, it was just inevitable I I I thought we'd already talked about this, but I guess it came after
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:10.700]   Twig last week google has announced
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.660]   Despite denials as recently as july
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:21.900]   Yeah, I guess we're going to shut down stadia after all the good thing is they're going to repur- refund any game and uh hardware purchases
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.780]   Of course your subscription fees will not be funded
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.220]   $2,000 worth. Yeah, well it could be a lot
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.940]   Uh, there is that one guy
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:38.700]   Who played red dead redemption for a total of uh 246 days
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.460]   jeez
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.980]   Not all at once
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:46.140]   Mind you but uh, you know, he played enough red dead redemption
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:53.260]   Almost 600 hours that his character very evolved. I'm sorry. Did I say 606 000 hours?
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.860]   Mm, uh, and he's going to lose that character
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.740]   Uh on january 1 when stadia
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.340]   shuts down he's a youtuber. It's color tv
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.300]   He tweeted shortly after the news. No
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.540]   You don't understand how seriously pissed off I am
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:16.140]   Uh for for context these hours all 6000 on google stadia
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:18.700]   when google shuts down
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:21.180]   my character my
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.660]   246 day old character will disappear
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:32.060]   He's begging rockstar the owner of red dead redemption to let him port his character from one to the other
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.980]   I mean, that's probably the worst case scenario, but there are people who have invested some time
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:42.140]   So he can port the character? No, not not as of now. He's asking to he's asking. Yeah as of now
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.620]   uh when stadia shuts down he will be
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.860]   At a lock
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.340]   Well, what is what but doesn't what what's I mean google's
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:56.940]   Has a a policy on on on being able to export your stuff. Yeah, but the rockstar has to support it too
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:01.660]   Yeah, I know that stadia was and ben Thompson points is that it was a bad idea
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.860]   Right from the very beginning
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.020]   um
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.940]   he says
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:14.380]   The problem with stadia was it was a product in search of an idea
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:17.500]   That google said well, we've got this capability
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.380]   We don't know anything about gaming
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:24.220]   But we could make a service a gaming service
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.700]   uh
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.700]   and you know
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.660]   That wasn't enough
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:32.620]   Uh
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:36.540]   He says here's why stadia was a bad product grand ben Thompson's trajectory. He quotes
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.100]   uh another uh writer
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:46.060]   Um, devon cold away of tech crunch saying the tech technical implementation certainly wasn't to be faulted
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:50.700]   um at its best stadia was better than its competitors almost magical
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:57.740]   And how it fulfilled the promise of going to zero to in-game in one second the business side was never quite so inspiring
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:01.740]   Ben says I go farther. I'd say it was lazy and stupid
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:05.740]   In fact in fact it was so lazy and stupid
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:11.260]   That uh, I was far more optimistic than I should have been when I wrote up stadia the first time
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.660]   uh
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:19.260]   Google I undoubtedly spent tremendous amounts of time right spend getting stadia to work from a technical perspective
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:22.300]   Then proceeded to spend literally zero time
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:29.580]   Figuring out a business model that made sense was streaming much less actually actually marketing, uh the service
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:34.940]   I guess I I can't disagree with that. They have some really great technical ideas
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:39.100]   Including the controller that was connected directly to google servers via wi-fi
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.540]   Instead of through the game which really made a difference in terms of latency
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:48.140]   I played a few games on stadia that played better on stadia than they would play like cyberpunk
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:50.940]   2077 and they would have played locally
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:55.340]   Um, but it's not exactly people the only person is crying is this one guy
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:58.780]   Red red much of a refunder you get how much did you spend?
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:05.980]   I think only I spent subscription fees and bought one game. So maybe i'll get 60 bucks back for cyberpunk
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:09.740]   So can I ask you to re re-prease one of your favorite sticks
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:19.260]   Which is your your disappointment in google, um, and i'm starting to see it better after the the you know, the the collection of tombstones here
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:25.900]   What's missing there? What what's happening at google? Oh, actually there's a very good. I think we've probably said this
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:33.420]   Before I don't know if I bookmarked it. There's a very good analysis that says the real problem is very simple. It's structural
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:40.300]   I think maybe it was mike elgin who said this that that people get promotions for inventing a new product
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:47.260]   But get no incentive for maintaining an existing product. Yeah, so the whole the whole way google is set up
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:50.540]   Is to create lots of new products and not support them
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:54.540]   So of course, what do you get a google graveyard?
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:58.460]   Because nobody's nobody's supporting these we've been saying this kind of it's what I do
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:03.020]   I start new degrees, but then I have i'm smart enough to hire the people who actually run them and i back off
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:09.580]   Well, and that's why mike says the real problem is sundart pachay. It's it at the top. It's leadership not
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:13.180]   Rest not solving this not restructuring
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:19.740]   ADD google everything. Yeah all over the dad gum place. Yeah
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:25.180]   Uh, I I honestly, uh, I mean, I don't know who else you would blame
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:30.060]   Yeah, uh, I think it's pretty clear that that's the problem many many people have said it
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   They've been saying it for years google incense
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:35.020]   People to come up with new ideas, but doesn't it doesn't
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:38.460]   Subtitlerian sarah air saying oh, we got to do something
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   No
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:47.260]   Or maybe oh, I don't know. I think they're so dialed out so dialed out. Yeah, there's a here's a
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.060]   Here's a tweet. This is I think the one I saw from hasana med
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:56.540]   The single most important factor for promotion at google is innovation google expects its employees to innovate
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.660]   The more you innovate the better your chances for promotion
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:04.140]   No matter if you've fixed a million bugs. Nothing doing just innovate once
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:07.260]   and you move up
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.060]   And this uh, this is you know quoting somebody
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:13.740]   That says a lot about Silicon valley too doesn't it? I mean it says
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:19.020]   It's about the whole culture this and by the way this original post that he's quoting was from I think from 2016
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:26.140]   We've yeah 26 or 2018. We've literally been talking about this for four four years. Yeah, we've known this was the problem
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:29.100]   It's kind of a bigger cultural problem
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:33.980]   I'm gonna say maybe an american problem. We optimize. Yeah, maybe
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:39.980]   Yeah, for we we over optimize for one thing and you can think about like wall street optimizing for
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.780]   quarterly profits. Yeah
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:48.300]   I mean in in that that cuts out and it silicon valley if you optimize for innovation
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:53.900]   But you don't consider all these externalities and we're probably making the same mistakes again
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.220]   When we look and try to tackle things that are complicated like climate change or you look at how
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:04.060]   We try to solve political issues. I mean, I think it's kind of an american issue
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:10.140]   and maybe we should really consider that and think about how really good points
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.660]   Casey
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.300]   I just don't know what how to get around it and
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:22.460]   Do we how to adopt from other cultures because not every culture not every culture does this it is I think I mean
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:27.260]   Others probably do but I do think there's something uniquely american about it. Yeah
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.060]   No, as I was at the conference. I was at yesterday
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.140]   They they brought out the old saw which is america innovates and europe regulates
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:40.700]   And we still do end up innovating more than others even for that and so but at what cost?
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:44.540]   I mean, I I do think that if you look at some of our innovations
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:48.140]   They're not the best
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:53.340]   There are things to get against the wall to see if it sticks, huh?
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:58.940]   Well, there's there's that and then there's the there there's harm that come from it
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:04.380]   And that there are harms that we embed in the system. So you look at something. Let's just take uber
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:11.580]   So we were all like, well, cab suck. This is terrible. This is great. Let's have uber and now we're looking at things like congestion
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:15.820]   We're also recognizing that the costs associated with it are much higher
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:17.580]   both from a
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.580]   externalities like congestion
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:26.220]   The gig economy the tax implications from that and that we'll be paying for as like taxpayers
[01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:30.940]   But also then think about the actual costs compared to like taxis
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:36.220]   They're all kind of even an elm and we're like, oh, maybe this wasn't the way to do it
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:39.420]   So but that's what happens when you optimize
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:46.540]   For like one thing at the expense of all others, which is a very short-sighted way to do anything
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:51.980]   I don't know. I wonder about products such as
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:56.780]   Google photos and drive. I guess they're safe because of all of the
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:03.500]   Data and data mining that google can do or are they even safe?
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.180]   Yeah, my I tweeted jokely, you know if when google gets rid of search
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.860]   But it's it's not much left
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:18.860]   Oh, they could be they could get rid of you know of drive and gmail. I'll that would be that would be just a disaster
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.580]   But see but there's a lot of that come data in gmail
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:28.620]   We know they're reading the gmail. So and they're starting to charge for it
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:32.220]   So, you know, don't worry. That's gonna make money one day
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.500]   That's the other thing is killed
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:40.540]   I'm not good. That's true. But Stacy Stacy you're right the you know, google was 98 add revenue
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.420]   And now I don't want us down to but I think it's low 80s
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:48.060]   And so they are bit by bit diversifying and that diversification matters
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:55.660]   Uh, you know, the other way is the clay shirky rule, which is the technology only becomes interesting when it gets boring
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:04.060]   And so maybe when the technology is something we just take for granted and we're bored that we stop innovating in the technology itself
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:07.740]   And we start innovating what we do with it and that's what interests me a lot more
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:13.500]   So google's gonna be spending some time in the supreme court of the United States of America
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.980]   As you know, uh, this is october
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.540]   This is when the supreme court announces
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:22.140]   It's docket of cases and on monday
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:25.180]   They announced a few things that they're gonna
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:30.220]   Here and they denied uh cert to some things they don't want to hear
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.300]   uh
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.300]   David laurie's efforts
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.780]   to get to get the justices
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:42.460]   To examine a class action settlements that go to charities instead of individuals
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:47.980]   This is something a lot of companies like to do. Okay, we'll settle but we're not going to give the money to the plaintiff
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:50.940]   Or the plaintiffs. We're gonna give the money to charity
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.900]   um
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:38:00.620]   Laurie david laurie was the founder of camper van batovan and cracker is that
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:04.460]   What is that great two great bands?
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.260]   Uh
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.380]   Okay, yeah later. I love a few bars leo
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:16.780]   Uh, I don't I can I would but I can't because I don't want to take it. We're gonna take it out
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:23.660]   All right, that is excuse you've heard there you've heard cracker. You've heard them camper van batovan was a big alternative
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.620]   Band in the 90s
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.620]   Uh later in life. Yeah
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.820]   You don't know that
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:35.020]   I was a big alternative person and a teenager
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:37.180]   You never heard of camper van bathe oven
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:42.140]   You heard a cracker. I know I have heard of cracker. Yeah
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.780]   Um
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.940]   Maybe because they were based out here in northern california. Maybe more aware of them
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:54.540]   Oh, you're just hit early. Oh, perhaps you've heard their song take the skinheads bowling
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:39:00.380]   All right, that's all I can play that's all I can play
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.020]   uh
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.860]   Anyway, anyway
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.780]   Anyway
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:13.580]   As you were saying before you were so rude larry after his great success in those bands
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.260]   uh
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:20.780]   Became an advocate of filing suits against spotify and napster later google
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:24.380]   for settling class actions by giving settlement money
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:31.980]   To charities in fact charities that it turns out took the tech giant side against him on copyright controversies
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.620]   He did not get his cert, but the supreme court did take up
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.420]   Renaldo gonzalez versus google
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:44.140]   Uh, uh, yeah, this is this is one that could really undermine
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:47.340]   Section 230 this communication station c act
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.140]   um
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.860]   So let me see if I can summarize
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:56.060]   the appellants
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:01.180]   Renaldo gonzalez at all our family members of a 23 year old who was murdered by terrorists
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:06.860]   Isis terrorists by studying in paris. They sued google. They want to hold them responsible
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.700]   for
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:13.580]   allegedly offering assistance to terrorists by recommending Isis videos
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.460]   in its algorithm
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:19.740]   And the justices agreed. Yeah, we should hear this case
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.780]   Ooh, that is dicey
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.060]   um
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:28.140]   So the question I guess uh boils down to weather section 230
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:31.340]   immunizes algorithms
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.300]   Not not it is it?
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.220]   You know immunizes publishers, but does it immunize algorithms?
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:44.300]   So this is really going to be a case about how content gets uh gets algorithmically boosted
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.620]   Yeah, uh, Stacy. I sure you're heading
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:52.780]   Should google lose i'm quoting now from uh my favorite puck news eric gardener
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.100]   writing
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:59.180]   Uh in this should google lose it'll poke a huge hole in section 230
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.260]   And probably lead to a wave of tort litigation around the country
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:10.540]   Facebook and tick tock for example could expect to see lawsuits for leading users into various forms of addiction
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.620]   They've already been suits along those lines
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:15.340]   um
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:17.340]   There's it doesn't by the way
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:20.860]   It there isn't the last line of defense. It's kind of more a majin O line
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.580]   It's because section 230
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:27.180]   Justices often just throw out these suits now they might proceed
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:30.940]   But it doesn't mean they would lose because there's still a first amendment defense
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.940]   So
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:37.740]   But it is it is a defensive line that would be uh that would be destroyed
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:40.940]   um
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:45.180]   The court did make a decision in favor of netflix earlier this year
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:50.060]   uh netflix was sued by a teenager whose suicide allegedly
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:56.140]   Was triggered by their movie 13 reason or the t their show 13 reasons why which was about
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.380]   teenage suicide
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:02.540]   Uh the family sued over netflix recommendation algorithm
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:05.100]   um
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.620]   Netflix's
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:13.980]   Their netflix is sturdy. There's not much there is no difference in an algorithm and a human editor and the court agreed
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:16.220]   So netflix won
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:23.660]   Uh, that's the only precedent i guess in this area. We'll watch that one. So what in october the first monday they announce
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.420]   What they're going to hear and then they hear those cases over a period of months and then they don't need to actually
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:33.820]   Release decisions later next year like the summer like july, right?
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.820]   June they do it in jim. Okay
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:39.340]   So we've put in everyone on notice. That's what you're saying
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:44.140]   They said no they just so they get a stack we talked about this yesterday and I learned how to pronounce
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:47.260]   certiorari
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:50.220]   Oh
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:56.300]   certiorari that's what jason snell says as i say it and I said oh that's a long way to certiorari but that was another
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.340]   another show for another time so
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:03.180]   certiorari so what happens is you don't have a right to appeal to the supreme court
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:06.300]   If you lose a case with a lower court
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:11.340]   Uh, you can't what you do is you then file and say hey, please supreme court
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:13.340]   Could you look at this?
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.140]   They then decide and the way it works is they have a rotating panel of four four justices have to agree
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:22.380]   Each each justice takes a certain there's a big stack takes a certain amount
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:29.420]   I I'm told what really happens is their clerks take the stack right up opinions on whether the court should take up this case or not
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:34.140]   If the court says yeah, we're not gonna take up the case as it did with the larry case. That's it. You're done
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:37.420]   There's no that's you know, they're not interested if they do
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:44.700]   It's an effective appeal now you can argue it before the supreme court and that's the final obviously the highest court in the land the final decider
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:49.260]   So uh, that's called uh the process called cert or certiorari
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:53.660]   because nobody wants to say certiorari in public and uh, and uh,
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:58.540]   So they there's cert for one and not cert for other larry did not get cert
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.380]   Uh, but this interest in case ronalda gonzalez versus google did
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.220]   Uh, there will also be some other
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.980]   Uh decisions. This is an interesting remember remember genius the rap genius remember them
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.180]   Uh, uh
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:16.780]   So
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:21.740]   We haven't yet heard whether they I don't at least as of the last time I checked whether they're going to give cert to this
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.380]   But they've been asked to investigate
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:27.260]   um
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.260]   A petition
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:31.420]   That could be interesting
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:38.300]   Rap genius, but you remember this we talked about it was sure that google was taking its song lyrics
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.100]   You know, that's what they did rap juries genius would give you the lyrics
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.900]   Oh, you know
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:50.460]   La flying up here burning my flame alone or whatever elton singing they would you could go there and they would say oh, yeah
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:53.180]   Uh, that's what this says
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:57.340]   So the company thinking google was doing this in their search results later trap
[01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:06.060]   They swapped the original apostrophes for a sequence of straight and curly ones that spelled out remember this red handed in morse code
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:10.060]   And of course google fell for it
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:13.820]   It's got copying the lyrics red handed one
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:18.700]   Since since genius itself was taking lyrics exactly
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:21.420]   It turned out
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:27.420]   The rap genius was in fact making transcripts, but they didn't actually own the lyrics the publishing
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:30.060]   Company and the songwriters did
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.260]   so, uh google
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:39.340]   You know genius attempted the whole google responsible, but google successfully argued the claim was preempted
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:42.700]   By copyright you don't have the copyright
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:48.140]   Well now, uh, this is going to the supreme court genius is represented
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.020]   uh by the same uh
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:56.300]   A lawyer josh rosen crance who represented oracle in its battle against google way back when
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:59.500]   Over the fair use of computer code remember that
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500]   um
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.180]   this time
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.940]   rap genius says
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:09.660]   Uh, it's the visitor terms and google's not adhering to those
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:15.260]   You can't it's wrong to measure whether a contract claim is qualitatively different from a copyright claim
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:20.060]   As the second circuit assists, but many apple appellate circuits in the nation don't
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:23.580]   The petition adds that having copyright law wipe out
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.220]   sacrosanct contract remedies
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220]   like
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.060]   you know our
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.060]   website terms
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.860]   I didn't know they were sacrosanct their sacrosanct
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:39.260]   Uh leads to absurd outcomes. They were sacrosanct. They're sacrosanct
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.260]   sacrosanct
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:46.620]   Hobbling digital services like yelp and wicki pedia that depend on user generated content, etc, etc
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:51.740]   So this will be very interesting the there were uh, there were some interesting
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.300]   Uh
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:58.380]   amicus briefs filed in this case actually the best amicus brief
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:02.620]   Of this session. Yes comes from the onion. Have you heard about this one?
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.180]   Yes
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.180]   You don't want to hear about it? Stacy
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.780]   I'm just grumpy. Just keep going keep going
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:13.980]   I get through it
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:16.540]   I don't have to do this story if you don't like it
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:22.620]   No, no, it's it's I feel like everybody has been talking about it. It's just like I'm like, yes
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:27.100]   Yes, have you heard it over and over like did you parody? What did npr already cover this on?
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.980]   On morning edition. Did you did you hear about less than an all things considered? I mean
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:35.020]   Am I am I um, I'm taking a page?
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:35.580]   I'm sorry
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.500]   And the NPR so five or a podcast talked about this week. I'm sure
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:45.740]   Basic basically like three of my news sources and npr and probably is a great story
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:49.900]   But I you know and if it's heard it over and over again. I probably should oh, but your audience
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:54.700]   Probably they don't listen to npr. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's what we love
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:57.820]   I'm being stupid
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:03.740]   Okay, I'll do this quick. How about that? I just want to honestly just want to read from the brief. That's all you know that's fun
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:10.300]   uh the the the the the the the the case is an amateur comic from parma, ohio
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:12.940]   who posted on
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:16.220]   Facebook a fake social media page
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:21.180]   Pretending to be the parma police departments facebook page mocking them
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:27.900]   Uh, the police didn't like it and they arrested him through him in jail
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.340]   um
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:33.340]   the uh
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:41.660]   Civil suit alleging his constitutional rights were violated was dismissed after a federal appeals court said police officers even in this
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.300]   Have qualified immunity
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:49.660]   Uh, wow, that's really they can do anything right apparently
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:51.420]   Uh
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:54.780]   The appellate judges said there is no recognized right to be free
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:57.740]   from a retaliatory arrest
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:01.180]   That is supported by probable cause
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.580]   uh novak is asking the supreme court to take this case up. I think they should
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.620]   the supporting brief filed
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:11.420]   by the onion
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.580]   Because they want to support parity
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:18.700]   Well, it's not cheap to file a brief. You really have to get real lawyers. You've got to do all this stuff
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:24.380]   It costs money to do a brief the onion, uh, called the supreme court literally their business
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:27.260]   They they called the supreme court latin dorks
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:31.820]   may be a questionable, uh
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:35.100]   Strategy that being called worse these days. Yeah
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:41.020]   They said they are the world's leading news publication with a daily readership of 4.3 trillion
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.740]   That has grown into the single most powerful influential organization in human history
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:51.180]   Obviously that's a joke and that the point being you don't announce parity
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:57.260]   Ahead of time or to disclaim it afterwards that eliminates the point of parity
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:03.420]   The onion cannot stand idly by in the face of a ruling that threatens to disembowel a form of rhetoric
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:05.900]   That has existed for millennia
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.780]   That is particularly potent in the realm of political debate
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:12.940]   And I think that they're absolutely uh absolutely right
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:19.820]   Yes, so um best headline I saw he was washing in post local man arrested for parity
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.940]   Well
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:27.500]   Local man, of course is one of the favorite terms of art in onion headlines
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:33.100]   And I agree, you know, honestly I agree with with the onion on this one. I hope the supreme court does the right thing
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.700]   One never knows these days what the supreme court is going to do and that is our supreme court
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:43.420]   I think it's up done our supreme court docket of the week
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.780]   Yes, was there anything else?
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:52.380]   No, I think that's the good one google is in uh court and has been fined 85 million dollars in arizona
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.860]   Actually, no, I'm sorry. They settled for 85 million dollars to end an arizona consumer privacy
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:02.780]   Suit the state sued google in 2020
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:09.340]   Claiming they surreptitiously collected data on users whereabouts for targeted advertising well, duh
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:11.900]   Um
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:18.460]   They violated the consumer product by gathering location data even after you opt out of a feature that records location history
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:25.740]   We've talked about this before you could turn that off, but there is another place you need to turn it off for google not to follow you around
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:27.660]   um
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:30.940]   Google said well the state consumer protection law requires fraud
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:38.140]   It has to be connected to a sale or advertisement they request the january the judge denied google's request to dismiss
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:44.460]   Is the largest amount per individual user google has ever paid in a privacy and consumer fraud lawsuit
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.340]   85 million dollars
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:53.260]   Of which um probably nobody's going to get much except the lawyers
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:52:02.380]   Google's also being sued over this by other states and uh and washington dc, so it's may not be over completely
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:07.900]   And I thought this was interesting. I don't know if this is tech, but I gotta mention this since we're talking about courts
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:11.180]   Walmart and cvs are uh on trial
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.620]   For putting homeopathic products next to real meds
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:19.740]   thereby giving some sort of implied
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:23.020]   Value to homeopathic medicines
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:28.300]   Gotta tell you sir when I saw this in the rundown. I was like, it's just a mistake
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.580]   Why because it's not tech
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.380]   Didn't it didn't give me a tech angle. What's what's the angle?
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:40.540]   Well, I think there the there's no tech angle. I just think that it's probably a good thing to reinforce
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:43.100]   that homeopathic remedies
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:47.500]   Are a medieval concept that has no
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.500]   Justification science whatsoever. Yeah. Here's the tech angle for you is that google gets in trouble for that
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:58.460]   And facebook gets in trouble for that for what they choose to advertise. Yeah, but not walmart, right?
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:02.940]   Yeah, and walmart doesn't you know put these fairly expand I mean
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:09.580]   It's it's partly that you're spending money on what is effectively water if you're buying a homeopathic medicine
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:13.980]   Um what I want to know is there's some danger potentially potentially though
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:14.940]   as well
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.820]   Did the homeopathic remedies pay for that
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:20.460]   Shelton space
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:21.820]   I don't know
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:25.580]   That's interesting. What is the implied if if a blogger has to
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:31.100]   um under ftc rules reveal if you got a free pen if I write about it
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:37.580]   Um, vogue magazine doesn't have to but the blogger does what about walmart is there is is the paid placement
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:40.300]   a an issue here
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:43.340]   Good point
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:45.340]   Because I would we put that in a weekly out
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:48.540]   Uh, rack space was very expensive. Yeah
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:56.940]   And the question is is a consumer being misled by the fact that these homeopathic remedies are put it next to and can walmart be bought
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:01.420]   Actual remedies. Yeah, I don't actually I'm looking at this article in our technique and I don't
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:08.220]   See that as being uh in part of the issue. I wonder. Yeah, that's a shelf space. I mean for if you have
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:11.500]   I watch shark tank and I know well
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:17.420]   Uh that from mark mark Cuban that if you want to get your chips on the oh, yeah, of course
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.900]   Restart shall you gotta buy placement? That's right. That's how grocery stores make money for the most exactly
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.300]   Yeah, it's marketing the caps
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.740]   uh two lower dc courts, uh said
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:30.860]   Uh
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:35.500]   That the placement on the shelves with real medicine did not constitute an actionable representation
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:41.500]   As to efficacy, but appeals court judges overruled efficacy efficacy
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.500]   efficacy efficacy efficacy
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:50.860]   Are you complaining about my positioning of the syllables? Yes here here. It's sacred sand man
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:54.540]   It's fake quaso
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:57.580]   efficacy sink
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.980]   efficacy efficacy
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:04.540]   But they're efficient. So I thought they'd be efficacy efficacy efficacy
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:09.580]   It's like a frick okay. Hey, is it time for the chase? You say frick Cassie?
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.980]   Frick cuz see
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:13.980]   You just want to get this over with don't you?
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:17.740]   Don't you want to torture you? I am losing so much fun
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:23.340]   Don't you I am losing so much steam. It's so sad. I'm sitting here and I'm like
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:27.580]   It's time for the shelf to google change law
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:33.340]   It's good thing Jason's dot here because
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:38.700]   There's not much in it. So it'll be fast. It's okay Stacy. Samsung rolling out in direct 12 to more devices
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.900]   Four new maps update google home app getting a website
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.580]   That's what we should be talking about home app is getting better
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:50.060]   But barely but barely getting better wrong wrong wrong wrong
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:52.220]   You disagree
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:57.020]   It's a great ben schoon who says the google home app is getting better, but barely
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:56:01.260]   It is pretty bad though. You will acknowledge that it is horrifying
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:07.660]   But it's going to be much better and it's going to pull in all this cool stuff that we've wanted forever
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:11.100]   It's going to solve the nest camera issue where half your old any of your old
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.020]   Google nest cams work only on the nest app not on the home app
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:20.300]   But only your new ones work on the home app so you can't see your other ones such a cluster app
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:23.100]   but now Charlie punch right now
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.380]   soon
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.780]   Soon they release it in preview and then early next year
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:32.460]   We're going to get a google home app that has all the functionality for your nest cameras
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:37.420]   On your home app. You're going to be able to see live video fees. You're going to get the moments that
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.580]   You can get on the nest thing
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:41.580]   Eventually they're going to bring your
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.980]   Older nest cams into the home app so you can then see all your cams in the same place
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:51.100]   They'll also bring those cameras to the web. That's amazing and even better for the super nerds
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:54.940]   You're going to get a script editor for your home and
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.500]   Thanks to matter google home for setting up routines is going to allow you to use
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:05.420]   Sensors to trigger routines, especially sensors that are not part of google's ecosystem
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:12.220]   That's a lot of really exciting things. We didn't even talk about google launching a new doorbell or there are six e Wi-Fi man
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:18.140]   Uh, they are offering a good new google Wi-Fi
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:24.060]   Base stations that are incompatible with existing ones, but do offer okay, but that
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.540]   Okay
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:29.740]   I know they're incompatible with existing ones, but how many of us buy
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:33.100]   Well, this is stuff I care about like
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.100]   Oh
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:38.540]   Jelf space
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:41.260]   Okay
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:43.260]   punk s
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:45.580]   But matter
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:47.580]   exciting
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:51.100]   And it relates to google darn it
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:56.460]   Oh, you thought because the show was called this week in google that it would be about google
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:02.300]   I understand the disconnect here now. I get it. I that is I know that's why I understand
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:08.860]   Silly stinky silly st so uh, no, you know that was an oversight. I forgot to mention
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:18.140]   Uh, these new products went did google announced this in an event? No, I thought mostly like we'd be talking about this tomorrow. They put this out your borrow is
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:26.060]   I can't tell you what tomorrow is tomorrow is tomorrow is a pixel seven and the pixel watch and possibly some other stuff
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:34.780]   Uh seven a.m. Pacific 10 a.m. Eastern time. Are you covering it? I will run Richards and I will be here in our jammies
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:41.100]   Uh actually run is in the east coast. So he should have you he'll be awake fully cafe. You know nothing. I'll be like
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:46.540]   I'm that way at nine o'clock for stacy's book club seven a.m. I'm sure
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:51.980]   So they already did announce though these updates tell me about this uh stacy the google Wi-Fi
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:59:00.860]   They announced two devices one is a wired nest doorbell for 179 99. How is that different than the hello hello
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:09.100]   That I uh it doesn't have quite all the features of the hello. Um, it's I think it's cheaper too. It's less expensive
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.100]   It comes in different colors
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:13.100]   Uh, so I have this generation
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.460]   Oh, no, there was a battery powered one last year. I have a wire
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:17.740]   Yeah, this is yeah
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:23.980]   This is the wired version of the battery powered one that was announced last should I upgrade my version one wired one
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:26.780]   For this
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:33.420]   It's got 960 pixels. I can't remember what the other does but google says that it's better because their pixels are larger
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:39.900]   They're using basically computational video. So it's lower resolution the original doorbell, but it's hdr
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:43.980]   Right. So it's more visibility. I don't know
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:48.300]   It can handle bright lights because a lot of times this is the case with doorbells
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:53.500]   Especially at night if you've got lights or or traffic lights or street lights or house lights
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.620]   They can blind the camera. So this will be better
[01:59:56.620 --> 02:00:04.380]   Um, it has I mean it has the traditional activity zones. They both have that. Um, two-way audio with noise cancellation
[02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:11.180]   I mean, yeah, IP54 water and dust resistance a lot of this is similar you have to buy it. Yeah, it's a little pretty much
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:17.100]   It is smaller if you want a smaller doorbell the mounting holes are actually the same
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:20.860]   So if you replace it, yeah, yeah, yeah, right
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:27.980]   Um, but I don't I mean unless you're unhappy with your doorbell. I wouldn't I'm not it's part of me resent a new doorbell
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:33.820]   Yeah, I'm kind of like I am not I did not get into tech reporting to write freaking doorbell reviews
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:35.900]   I did not want to sit
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:39.820]   That's just me. What did you get into tech reporting? What did you just curious?
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:46.780]   I want to know how the world works. Quiring minds want to know what subjects I should put into next week's show
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:51.260]   Okay, it doesn't agree with the bad way. Who's house to do these colors match?
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:58.060]   I don't know I would tell like the match or create a pop of color and I'm like oh, I see I see those colors now that gray
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:02.780]   I see constantly. Yeah, it's all it's all the the the the home shows how's that?
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:09.500]   Yeah, everything's neutral now. So these are neutral ugly ass neutral colors. Okay. So those exist
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:12.140]   and then the other
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:14.140]   The the nest Wi-Fi
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:19.100]   Pro adds so this is google's next mesh Wi-Fi system
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:25.820]   It is not backwards compatible, but when's the last time you bought a mesh Wi-Fi system and bought like an upgrade
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:29.420]   Extended you don't you buy them in a set so new a new so the hell cares
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:33.500]   Well, um this one is notable because it has six
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:37.260]   Okay, I spent money on the other ones go ahead. Yeah
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:43.420]   But you probably bought it like three years ago when that's about how I'm three to five years is when you buy a new router
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:47.580]   So these support speeds up to 5.4 gigabits per second
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:51.980]   They come in four colors including them in grass. I don't know
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:54.460]   Um, they each access point
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:02:02.460]   Are they? It's pews does it come in pews? So this interesting they're shiny. They've designed they've left by the fabric
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:10.140]   Design that everything used to be fabric colored from google now. This is like shiny like ceramic. Yeah
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:13.340]   It's like plastic anyway
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.340]   um
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:16.220]   each
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:23.020]   access point covers 2200 square feet it's tri-band which means it brings in 2.4 and 5 which we're all used to
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:29.500]   It also adds 6 gigahertz, which is the relatively uncluttered spectrum that the fcc approved in 2020
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:35.420]   So that only matters though for other six e devices
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:41.260]   So six e is the six gigahertz designation. So if you've got Wi-Fi six e it's gonna have that
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:46.940]   I think apples new phones are six e their new life. They do. So you're gonna see it on your
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:49.180]   phones your laptops
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:52.940]   You're gonna start seeing it on gaming consoles and possibly TVs
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:56.940]   The benefit is gonna be for like because it's a lot of spectrum
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:00.540]   You can get a lot of data in there and it's gonna be amazing. It's not good for the iot
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.220]   So don't look for it there because your iot devices are too cheap to have a tri-band radio
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:05.740]   um
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:07.420]   So yeah, and those are going to be
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:11.980]   1.99
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:14.620]   200 bucks for a one pack 300 for a two pack
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:19.100]   400 for a three pack two packs dead though. So just get the three pack
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:24.700]   Uh, yeah, and then they also have security like they're not charging you for security
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:30.300]   And like some of the some of the other router companies charge you a fee for like that's nice
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:33.500]   Yeah, it's 99 bucks a year extra for euro
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:39.980]   Pro so that's nice and they killed their cheaper version last week when amazon did the device launch
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:44.620]   So, uh, wired says that they are shiny like a tick-tack
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:51.180]   Like a giant tick-tack on your shelf. Yeah, so shiny didn't know that no, they're not actually
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:56.380]   It says looks glossy like a shiny tick-tack. So I guess you have to get a shiny
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:00.620]   Tick-tack you're right. They're not they're mad. Well, let's now investigate our tick-tack. So you have that
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.660]   They're mad
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:08.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is gonna drive state we could we can do a five-minute conversation just to drive stacey crazy
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:12.700]   Tack, but we won't do that today on the pixel six
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:15.580]   I got my update for october the october fifth
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:21.580]   Security update bad news if you have an excel for it's the end of the line
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:23.660]   That's the last you're gonna get
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:28.780]   End of life for the pixel for the crappy pixel. I think some people call it
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:33.820]   Um, I never called it that I thought the four was better than the five but
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:39.100]   Um, anyway, it's the end of life after three short years of service
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:45.580]   For pixel four you will not normally there's kind of like one last update. No, that's it. You're done
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:48.940]   This is the one
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.940]   Famously the rick osterlo
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.340]   like days before they launched
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:58.940]   Told his employees. I don't agree with some of the decisions you made and I'm really disappointed with the battery power
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:03.900]   What
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:12.140]   Mark that's way been mark levoi the camera guy the brilliant camera guy left and went to adobe and maria adobe now. Yeah, so
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:18.540]   I think the pixel sixes have been pretty good now that you have a new one you you like it
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:21.740]   Again, we will talk about the seven tomorrow and we will decide
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:27.340]   Whether it's worth an upgrade for pixel six owners, but definitely if you're pixel four
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:30.620]   Possibly if you're pixel five you want to look at the pixel seven
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:34.780]   And I don't know if I said it the last time we talked about the update
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:41.740]   People were fussing about the battery life being crap after the update and then they had to patch it
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.780]   And I got the patch and it took it about two days and then my battery life was
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:52.860]   Nice way better. It's good. Great. I'm at 74 percent right now at four o'clock in the afternoon
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:57.900]   Yeah, I don't feel any up reason to upgrade the six. I love my six. I think it's great. Well six is fun
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:01.180]   We'll find out tomorrow. They'll they'll give us reasons. It's tensor two
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:04.700]   The sad thing about tomorrow is a bit ways less. I might get it
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:06.640]   Because you have
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.380]   Floppy risk queen floppy risk
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:13.900]   It you know, this is one of those cases where there is not going to be anything new tomorrow
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:18.460]   I'll be shocked if there is everything's been leaked by retailers by amazon
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:21.100]   Stacy did you get a
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:24.380]   NDA you seem to hit you might know something tomorrow
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:31.420]   And I honored there embargo embargo so I have one question only one question
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:34.780]   Is the right or wrong about there being any surprises?
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:38.620]   I can't tell you because I have oh
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:41.340]   Oh, oh exciting
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:45.660]   Exciting do you want to join? Well, I couldn't I think I couldn't give you any indication whatsoever
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.740]   I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna be a dick. Do you want to join me tomorrow morning?
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:53.900]   Uh seven a.m. Uh join ron and me and talk about no, but you know what?
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:57.500]   I'm coming on
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:01.340]   I could like you're towards Stacy. How did I could like it took you a minute to decide that I know
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.900]   Yeah, jeez
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:04.620]   No
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:08.300]   What you're going on somebody else's show to talk about I'm good. What is it?
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:09.260]   Is it all about you?
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:11.500]   What's the guardian show to my own news weekly?
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.820]   You're gonna go on there. She's in the talk. She's in talking matter tomorrow
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:19.660]   Oh, you're gonna talk about matter, but you may talk about the pixel seven. I would bet
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:22.700]   With mica. I mean, yeah
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:25.180]   It's okay. He wants me to talk to him about that
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:27.900]   Oh, he will
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:31.820]   Oh, he will once he learns that you you have information
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:37.420]   I think he will have happened by then. Oh, you have information that we're all gonna know tomorrow
[02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:40.380]   Yeah, okay
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:42.780]   I said the devices to Kevin
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:49.900]   If a google billionaire can't make flying cars happen can anyone kitty hawk
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:55.100]   The air taxi startup larry page funded is dunded
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.980]   Ta ta ta. There's larry
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:02.460]   Saying why did I put so much money into this? We haven't seen him in ages. I know
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:07.020]   I think that's the talk where he's saying. I wish we had an island. I think it was the island talk
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:07.820]   I think I actually
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:09.820]   I thought yeah
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:10.780]   uh
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:12.780]   Decade ago the flying car company
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:17.740]   Was seen as one of the most likely to make breakthroughs in all the google moonshots guess not
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.180]   No taxis guess not
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.660]   Restuck with uber. Yeah
[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:25.660]   kitty hawk is gone and
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:30.940]   Lest you take google maps too literally you might want to
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:37.020]   Look at this tweet from jason scott at text files a series of pictures
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:41.980]   From real world places where google maps is wrong
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:47.980]   Wrong dead end no lake access google maps is wrong or
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:54.620]   Google is wrong this road does not go through to canyon creek trailhead turn around
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:09:00.780]   Or google maps is wrong. This is not matthew court private road
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:03.660]   I think is there are all signs that they went and had made
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:06.620]   Professionally because it happened all the time
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:14.380]   Here's one that was not made professionally made with a stencil and spray paint google maps is wrong and they won't fix it
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:18.860]   This is not the way to kei lake and kua bay
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:23.740]   So don't go that way. It's a private road do not enter
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:28.220]   Man there must it must be like a dozen people a day go down that road
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.180]   To make them make that's that sign
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:35.980]   Yeah, the hilarious that's the beauty of by the way open street maps is you can fix it
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:41.660]   You can fix it. I have google things my issues five doors down
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:45.820]   Something just skitter to cross your floor
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:51.180]   Yeah, who's yeah, it's a large rat. Yeah, bring the rat over here
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:59.580]   Are you serious? Yeah, it's just a pet. Yes. It's a little burk has a weird. I don't know. He's look. It's oh that floor. I think about mine
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:05.580]   It's so cute. Sorry. I just was like what the just ran across the oh
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:10.940]   Oh my scared me to death stacy. She's the sweetest and you know what?
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.300]   She scares stacy. She took a shower with you
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:17.500]   Right
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:25.820]   Look at that. Oh, did you press your shoe to danger? This is how you get stacy to stick around for the show. Yeah, yeah
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:31.260]   I figured out we don't we we don't have to talk about chess
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:35.340]   We don't have to talk about home email. I lost any conductor
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:42.140]   All we need is a ton of those things puppies. Oh, what a sweetie. What's the name such a sweetie? What's her name?
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:45.340]   Lillie you you're not gonna change it
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:48.140]   Lily is that the new name?
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:51.020]   That's the only name
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:54.780]   You're not going to change it. Pass an aggressive grandparent right there
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:11:00.620]   There were there were names given to these pups bergs mom and dad had five
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:07.340]   Chewy was the name so you did change it. I think lily is much better than chewy. Uh-oh
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:11.900]   Uh-oh the boss is coming the boss doesn't like me handling lily
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:15.500]   The boss says lily belongs to me
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:22.060]   Actually lily has a sister that is un uh, uncalled
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:25.180]   Un uh, what are you earmarked? What do you call it?
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:27.980]   What?
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:30.620]   Oh, she's a doc mommy. I thought you said you adopted mommy
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:33.260]   He's like I now have a pet
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:39.900]   She's very lily's very sweet. Yeah, so chewy was the original. I mean, lily's much better. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:45.260]   Chewy's funny. I like chewy because she does look like a wookie. He does look like chewy. Yeah, like a baby wookie
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:49.100]   You look good with that dog in your arms. You're natural
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.260]   Oh
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.220]   She is really about this week. What are they they're toy poodles
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:12:00.700]   But well, they're they're mixed, but I think there's poodle in there. Yeah, they're not they're not purebred
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:06.700]   Yeah, but she's not gonna get much bigger her. They said her dad is really small
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:10.140]   Oh
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:13.900]   Chewy and that's the kookles change love
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:22.140]   Stacy you scared me. I didn't know who's house you were talking about and I thought there was a rat in my house
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:26.460]   I'm sorry. I just saw something skitter across in the bed. I was like
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:31.900]   I've just learned her full name is lily rosemary and the jack of hearts
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:34.940]   Which i'm guessing is a reference to
[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:38.060]   And i'm freeze mcgis song. I don't know
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:43.100]   Huh bob dylan lee rosemary and the jack of hearts
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:50.940]   Oh, yeah, no, I know what you're talking about. Do you have a thing for us miss Stacy a bubble?
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:53.900]   Oh, I do
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:57.260]   I didn't know where they're already you survived Stacy you've arrived
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:02.940]   I'm for I have to tell a little bit and woefully unprepared. I'm unboxing the place
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:05.740]   The boys were planning for the fall
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:09.740]   The cabaret was quite except for the drill it and the world
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:13.420]   The cab you had been lifted in the game did we'll shut down
[02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:17.980]   Anyone with any since you they already lived down. I'm just filling for you
[02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:20.620]   I know I that's why i'm apologizing
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:24.700]   backstage the girls were playing five cuts stood by the stairs
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:28.540]   This is a great song. I forgot about this. So it's from blood on the tracks, right?
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:32.220]   Yeah, one of the great great albums of all time now ladies and gentlemen
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:37.260]   This intermusical interlude brought to you by stasis thing of the week
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:43.260]   It looks like a heat sink, but it does what is it? I was like it looks like a heat sink
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:47.260]   This is everything set. I wrote about this company about a year ago
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:51.020]   And this is a box. It's kind of like a firewalla
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:56.460]   Except the end application is a little bit different. So what happens is I pugless in publish?
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.420]   No, I plug this into my network
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:04.220]   It's going to act as a bridge to my router. All of my device data is going to go through this
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:08.540]   And what's going to happen is I'm going to get on their app a score
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:12.780]   And the score is going to be like from one to ten. I think it's one to ten unless they changed it
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:15.580]   It's going to say things like
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:18.220]   Your home is super secure or your home sucks
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:23.020]   And I know had I been in town last week. I would have
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:29.660]   Had it available been plugged in but I don't plug in new devices without my family like when i'm leaving
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:32.540]   Um, but I will let you know how it is
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:39.820]   And it's a device and a service and it's designed to basically help me assess
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:45.580]   How secure and high quality my devices are if they're doing anything weird
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:50.380]   But it is not giving me the log type data that I get from like a firewalla
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:53.820]   So it's maybe a little bit more friendly for normal people
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:56.620]   um
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:59.180]   I don't know if this is the level of information
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:05.180]   Your audience will what but it might be good in your audience. I mean they're your audience too, you know
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:12.780]   My audience is actually I I feel like my audience is actually a little less nerdy believe it or not
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.860]   I feel like your audience is very tech savvy. So you probably want very nerdy
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:20.540]   Oh, no, no your audience is because it's it's your
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:27.340]   To have a subset of nerd them. That's right. The more focused you are nerd interest, but you have
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:31.180]   High interest in the subset of nerd them. That's that's nerdier
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:36.940]   So, uh, you don't you use a firewall? I feel like you're a firewall. I do I I I
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:41.340]   I when I tell that's why I didn't plug this there are over. I didn't want to. Oops. Sorry about the noise
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:44.940]   This is lady a lady talking about why
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:48.620]   I don't know what salad has to do with the rumba with the
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:51.260]   convenience
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.460]   Oh
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.580]   It's telling you it's about security. Yeah. Yeah
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:16:01.660]   So it'll it does tell you like it gives you alerts and warnings and I don't think you can buy this yet
[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:05.980]   But I'm really interested. Yeah, it's a device I'm playing with and testing
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:12.940]   Um, and it's a score. Yeah, it is a one to 10 score. So higher is more secure lower is insecure
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:15.660]   So next week after I've plugged it in I'll come back and tell you
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:19.180]   So it doesn't actually block it. It just tells you what's going on
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:24.780]   It gives you alerts and warnings, but it doesn't I guess it wouldn't want to block it because that would break functionality
[02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:29.900]   Right, you don't like I can my firewall will quarantine things if I tell it
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:34.860]   But normally it just sends me a notification that's like you've got some ump
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:37.500]   ump p ump what a
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:42.700]   Agrana help me. I'm losing it port forward. It going on here and I'm like, oh no
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:45.500]   And then you know, it'll be like
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:48.540]   Pmp universal plug up ump that's it
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:51.180]   I was like ump pq r
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:54.780]   Am q co-app qtt
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:59.260]   So this is interesting. They're giving it. It sounds like they're giving it away in a year of service
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:03.180]   For $10 of setup fee just because they want the growth
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:08.780]   Yes, they're they have their early access program right now. Maybe I shouldn't have shown you all this
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:13.660]   Well, it's on the no it's on the webpage everything. Okay good set dot call everything set
[02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:15.100]   Yeah
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:22.460]   Everything set ink or everything. So really it's almost a research project on what kind of information IOT devices are spitting out
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:27.660]   Well, they do want it. It's it's a venture back company that will eventually charge you money
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:34.780]   Or maybe they're going to sell this data. They I know they want to go corporate. So their whole hope is that like
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:39.340]   With people working from home is that people will
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.300]   Like corporations like if you work for IBM
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:48.620]   They'll give you this because IBM has a vested interest in their computers being on a secure home network. Yeah, and then
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:52.460]   So that's I think they're big plan. I we'll see
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:55.980]   But I'm excited to try it. I think it's really interesting
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:18:00.860]   We should have more tools like this. Is it compatible with a firewall or other security devices? No
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.660]   Just one of the other
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:08.540]   Yeah, I don't need to be daisy chaining like six dpi things my network will be like
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:16.860]   Very interesting. Yeah, I mean to some degree you're right. I certainly are security and now listeners are probably
[02:18:16.860 --> 02:18:22.060]   more and you know interested in role in a role your own solution like pf sense and
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:28.060]   You know, there's they can do all this stuff with a device of their own making so to speak
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:30.620]   but uh
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:33.180]   For a normal person this might be quite an eye opener
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:36.860]   That's that's probably like
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:40.620]   That's what I think would be the case, right? Um
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:45.740]   And I think if you imagine them going after the corporate audience
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:50.380]   Then that makes sense because you would not want to like like if I gave a firewall a like
[02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:58.380]   If I gave a firewall to my sister in the I don't think she would ever play anything else in again, right? She's like oh my god
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:04.540]   So steve generally talks about this is what he uses. Uh, it's from net gate. It's a
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:10.140]   Security gateway that runs pf sense is 189 bucks similar idea. It's like a small
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:16.700]   You know iot device, but it's a full that's a full internet gateway and of course one of the things you could do is
[02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:20.060]   Look at the kinds of traffic that's being sent out and so forth. So
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:26.940]   Yeah, that's a little that's a little more geeky. I it's too geeky for me. I I don't want I don't I don't want to set this up
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:30.300]   But uh, it's a good choice if you want something even more horsepower
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:36.620]   Numbers lister jeff javis numbers so the washington post had a fascinating story
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:44.060]   Using data that is also on the rundown. I just added it for the most common restaurant cuisine in every state and a chain restaurant mystery
[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:46.780]   And the mystery is this
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:51.500]   Why does it correlate and notice I said correlate not cause why does it correlate?
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:57.740]   That the states with the areas the places with the most chain restaurants voted
[02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:00.940]   for trump overburden
[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:06.140]   Now we
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.820]   Make a trillotrash joke, but I as a fan of talk about I hope you don't
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:12.780]   Um, what is uh, what are the number one?
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:14.940]   uh
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:18.620]   Chain restaurants and places like a tucky west virginis is stuckies
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:21.260]   Is that awful house
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:26.860]   Give me a quick for a hundred on the next link in the in the well, let me get to the punchline here
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:27.820]   I'm gonna
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:33.660]   This was parlor is so they checked on education. They checked on all kinds of things and they did not find correlation
[02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:38.780]   Between the restaurants and and and what was going on and what they found was it was car culture
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:41.580]   Yeah, this places with more cars
[02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:46.620]   Also more for trump and I think i was california has a lot of cars. I mean, yeah
[02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:50.780]   We're definitely a car culture up here in uh petaluma
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:55.020]   I don't think but you also have buses and things there. We're not if you go to the next
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:57.740]   uh, uh
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.060]   The next link on washington
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:06.220]   Washington is big on age he food most of the west and south west is uh is uh
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:08.700]   Mexican as you would expect
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:09.820]   uh
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:16.780]   Midwest is pizza. You know the it's here's a weird story. The only place where hawaiian is number one is down here in hawai
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:21.580]   Just uh, I thought that was interesting
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:24.540]   Funny how that works. There's the pizza belt
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:31.180]   Uh, but the upper midwest which really means beer. Yeah, but the blue is the fast food belt idaho
[02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:32.700]   Utah
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:34.700]   Missouri and the southeast
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:42.060]   So if you go to the next link in the run down, sir, yes, oh, there's women. I'm not in the run down in the run down
[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:48.380]   Oh, okay, because there's the data because you can play it's interactive. Oh, you can you can now put in one of your chains on the right there
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:51.500]   And see where they are interesting
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:54.620]   So on there comes i've selected option
[02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:57.420]   No, just stay in the u.s, please
