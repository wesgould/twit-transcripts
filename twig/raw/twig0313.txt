[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.960]   It's nice to have you you brought some dopey chrome thing. It's just plain large
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.900]   Just plain very large. This is an Acer chrome base touch
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.280]   $430 and it's just it's just enormous prices right though. It's great, you know, it's like it's a big screen
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.080]   It's a touch screen 10 points of touch and it's cheap
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   And it's a Chromebook basically and you're reviewing it for before you buy I did I did do and gave it a buy
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.400]   Because because the price is so good and the fact that how are these speakers or is there is that grill at the bottom?
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.480]   Just those are speakers and they sound terrible. Oh too bad
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.360]   So that was a that was a con it's kind of a show-offy thing
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.120]   Yeah, I put that grill down there like maybe you have stereo speakers. They look like great speakers if that's worth anything, right?
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.360]   also with us
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   From the lake. I'm so jealous Matthew Ingram
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.800]   Formerly of giga oh now fortune calm and celebrating his anniversary. There was lovely wife you two were so young
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   Yeah, we got married in elementary school yours is that on Facebook or Instagram? I'm seeing that I can't remember but
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   Probably both yeah, just great pictures
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.920]   Congratulations, and I'm jealous. We're all jealous of your lake house there
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.480]   So pleasant. I'll take a paddle for you. Yeah, have the black flies started yet. Oh
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.680]   Damn, yep
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.800]   Trying to find some negative something yeah something wrong with it. It's so beautiful too hot yesterday. Oh
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   Way hot it too bad. There's in the lake. Yeah, it's a shame. There's no
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.400]   Body of water in which to cool yourself and Jeff Jarvis is here. We're so thrilled Jeff has been champing at the bit for
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.600]   When it went when when was the alphabet announcement? We have our new theme song we do
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:41.960]   Record that printed we're done we were done
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.000]   Jeff is probably a rights issue
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   You know we're
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.480]   Was his 65th birthday was yesterday and and we're waiting for a mass a major court decision that will finally free
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.680]   happy birthday
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.320]   Because Warner Chappelle music has been charging people rights
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   Thousands of dollars in some cases for the right to play the song happy birthday or a rocket
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.060]   But there's a smoking gun they had somewhere in the back office there at Warner Chappelle a
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.240]   printed version of happy birthday without a copyright announcement I guess in the 30s if you did that you seated
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.920]   This seems like a real loophole you seated copyright it made it made this the thing not
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.400]   not copyrighted public domain and
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   We're waiting for the court to rule on that
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.000]   But I'm hoping that will happen during the new screen savers on Saturday
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080]   We're gonna be discussing it and we could maybe sing happy birthday. Yes. Yeah, finally
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   To was unencumbered if that's your birthday. You want to be here. Yeah, because everybody will see you too
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.480]   Is there anything like three million dollars a year from that?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.120]   That's crazy. It was a song written in the 1800s
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.760]   But then the the two kindergarten teachers who wrote the lyrics
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.720]   I something they changed it post 1927 and of course anything that's copyright post 1927 is copyright forever
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.440]   Thanks to would Mickey Mouse. Yeah, it originally was something for kids and
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.040]   They just wrote the lit they didn't even write the music right
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.160]   No lyric the music already existed there were a bunch of different lyrics and they yeah anyway
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.600]   So Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey let's kick it off. We're gonna have to talk about alphabet at some point
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   Let's start the show with alphabet. Yeah
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.680]   ABC
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.160]   XYZ that's the page because Google forgot to get alphabet calm
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   No, it's not WTF
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:50.440]   With well, I guess that's one question will anybody ever go to alphabet calm because it isn't really a day
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.360]   Yeah, my question my related question is will there be alphabet swag because I want it. Yeah
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.640]   So we'll let you kick things off Jeff because you wrote a good piece of buzz machine calm
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.080]   I know you've been thinking hard about this
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.040]   What the hell
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.120]   You know what in the second day we've seen lots people trying to find some cynical motive which I find ridiculous because
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.720]   Larry pages I think the least cynical CEO I can imagine I think it is what they say it is
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.120]   This allows Larry page and Sergey Brin to rise up to the strategic stratosphere
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.520]   It allows them to do crazy things without affecting directly the business of Google apart from taking Google's revenue to pay for it
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.200]   It provides more transparency to Wall Street about what's being spent on one
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   We'll see how exactly that plays itself out. It allows them to put Sundar Pichai who's done brilliant work in full charge of
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.840]   The business and and the many Sundar Pichai's there are many people that are more easily retained through this
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   look at NAST look at other places and
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   You know the thing about it is you know
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   But the anecdote I told is and I don't know if I told us on the show before but when I think I did when I met Larry at
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.800]   I owe by way of introduction
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.840]   I said on the guy who wrote the book what would Google do and he said oh yes
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.640]   I remember and then he said what would Google do I want to know tell me what and
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.560]   You know so it makes a punchline to this story
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.040]   But I think that the point is is that Larry page doesn't know what Google will do
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.240]   That's exactly the point is that is that even he will be surprised
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.780]   They're looking for big problems and big solutions and moonshots and all that kind of stuff and and there's been efforts also to make
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.080]   Analogues here to call this Berkshire Hathaway, but that's not it's not close. It's brilliant as but it is
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.280]   He doesn't invent things. I've though
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.160]   I'll be don't call it close to the old AT&T Bell labs, but it's not that either
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.460]   That was you know pure science pure research amazing things happened because there was that freedom to do that and the monopoly to support it
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.960]   But I think that in this case this is about
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.440]   invention and entrepreneurship and its purest form and the ability to go and try big things and that's why I'm delighted with this
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.520]   The final point to make is the question about what this impact this will have on dear old Europe and its
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   regulators from the old world
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.840]   And and one argument says that this will make it better because
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   Part of the problem Google gets into is what it shares stuff across divisions
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.680]   But the truth is that everything that we've gotten in trouble for sharing across is still in Google ink
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.120]   And and I'm afraid that well I guarantee you will see just really saw the cover of their Spiegel a few months ago
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   But the world government of Silicon Valley
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.480]   This will probably I guarantee you it'll get it'll get cited as see Larry Page wants to take over the world and do all these huge things
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.120]   Yeah, he does and damn good for it. That's what we should be supporting. That's what capitalism is for
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.840]   So I don't think Europe's problems will go away at all for this
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.800]   I don't think there's some gigantic secret agenda to this
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.920]   I think it's what it appears to be which is freedom to innovate you take the post that Larry put at ABC.xyz at face value
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.480]   It's it's exactly as he said it is. Yeah, I don't see because why else do this right?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.080]   I you know, there's a lot of efforts to say it's funny
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.960]   How many posts if you look I just wrote a I just started a new column minutes ago for the observer in New York on media
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.600]   And I wrote about all how we all write the same story over and over and over again and how I hate that yeah
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.160]   How many blue moon stories we have well in this case how many times did I see the the headline?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:21.040]   Why Google did this as if everybody knows exactly why Google did this well Google said why Google did this and you could believe them or not
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.440]   But yeah, I think you know if listen if Comcast did something like this rising to something like this if companies like that did something
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   Would I be cynical or at least?
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.240]   Skeptical better put of their motives. Yeah, but I don't think we've had the cause to be skeptical and cynical about
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.840]   Larry Page I think that he's trying to do good things and make good products and yeah
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.320]   I make a lot of money along the way and so far
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.640]   That's what he's done and the crazy stuff that mean who else who else would have the audacity to say let's save thousands of lives
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   on the roads by inviting self-driving cars and
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.880]   The entrepreneurial vision and technological vision to make it into a business
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   That's the kind of audacity that made this country great. I'm it not Donald Trump's hat
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.720]   and
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.800]   And and that's what we want to encourage you agree Matthew
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:17.160]   Well, I mean sure I mean I I don't see any ulterior motive. I don't see the
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.280]   You know, I don't see it being some vast evil plan, but I submit I do wonder whether
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.600]   They're out a bunch of different motives
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   I mean obviously freeing Larry and Sir JF to do whatever they want is one of those motives to get them away from the sort of humdrum
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.120]   Day-to-day Google which which turns out all the cash, but but has become quite boring
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.800]   But I wonder if some of it isn't a
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.320]   Little bit of not slight of hand a little bit of a shell game to try and keep the regulator's eyes off
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.820]   What you know is happening with Google or to keep Google part of this
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.880]   You have to be pretty dumb to be fooled
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   Play it through for me
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.080]   About how this puts fences around things in a way that I'm not asking this in a hostile way
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.440]   I'm curious to try to figure out that that obviously that's a factor in what Google does right now is to try to have that
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   So they don't wonder anything. It's gonna make it worse
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.100]   How do you think it could make it better for the regulation question? I don't think it necessarily puts fences around things
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.100]   but when you think about the
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.920]   Public entity, you know the traded one the one that has to report its results is gonna be alphabet now not Google
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.880]   so to some extent and I'm not saying they're going to
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.440]   Confuse things deliberately you're in an illegal way or I'm just saying it takes the focus off
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.200]   Google to some extent and puts it on this other thing called alphabet which is gonna have
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:54.640]   multiple different things doing multiple different, you know businesses and markets and business models
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.520]   And there's gonna be things flowing back and forth none of which
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.440]   Alphabet will have to talk about it if it doesn't want to it won't have to report
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:10.560]   Anything that those underlying operating subsidiaries do if it doesn't want to right including Google
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.580]   So Google was the reporting entity before to see what I mean
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.680]   Whereas now alphabet's okay, but when it comes to the activities of what's their privacy
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.160]   You know my contention is that Google is a personal services company and as a result
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.040]   It needs to know me as a person and serve me across all his divisions
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   So it serves me still across
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.480]   The browser and Android and Gmail and docs and so on and so forth and maps and ways and so on so forth
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.800]   So all that's where they've gotten in trouble lately in the ones right the other way they've gotten in trouble
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.080]   Let's all the privacy the other way they've gotten in trouble in Europe in the current antitrust is they promote their own products
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.720]   Well, they're still gonna promote maps within Chrome and within search
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.600]   And it doesn't matter whether they promote
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.480]   Self-driving cars and say that or not fine. They'll buy ads for that whatever that'll make it a corporate exchange
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   So I think that the areas where they've gotten in trouble in Europe and let's be clear that's mainly in Europe
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:14.600]   It's still the case within Google and it's not about financial reporting. It's about behavior is what they'd say
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.160]   But I am but I'm also thinking they're probably thinking about the future
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.720]   They're not just thinking about the things they've gotten into trouble for already
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.920]   In fact many of those things are have become irrelevant or are becoming irrelevant
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   I think they're thinking about what they may do in the future which includes acquiring other companies
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:41.160]   Twitter whatever else, you know, and they will become presumably operating units of alphabet and then they can do whatever they want
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.800]   Within those operating units. Do you know what I mean? They can they can not not I'm not just talking about the sort of public facing
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.200]   promotional aspect that they've gotten into trouble for I'm talking about the actual structural
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:00.080]   aspect of the company itself and the things it owns and the things that those businesses do between each up by the way
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:06.320]   I was on Bloomberg about this yesterday and the other guy who was on the show said that the price jump that came from this announcement
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Itself was just enough to buy Twitter
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   Loves it. Yeah, it went up 5% in an hour. That's enough to buy Twitter. That's 20 billion dollars
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   Yeah, and which is odd in a way because you know Wall Street typically hates holding companies it hates
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:31.080]   Giant things that you can't make sense of the argument is there'll be more transparency here because they'll have to report results for these other divisions
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.000]   Well, yeah, they won't but they're saying it's the same expected to they'll be expected to well
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   They've said they will they don't have to in fact they could say hey alphabets doing great. Here's our all our operating units
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.680]   Google made this much. Thanks for stopping by
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:53.480]   Really is that the case? I mean isn't it isn't the so the Google stock is being transferred to alphabet stocks
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.400]   So if you're a stockholder don't they have the same responsibility now to report alphabet results that they had for Google results?
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.320]   Yeah, the point Matthew's point exactly right
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.120]   They don't have to say just as Google never had to say exactly what YouTube was they could say alphabet as a whole. Yes
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.760]   That's all they have to report. Okay
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.800]   I've heard all around is there'll be more transparency rather than less that there will be
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.600]   There could be and it also
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.680]   I mean one of the benefits I can see is this structure makes it a lot easier to say in the future
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:29.320]   spin off or spin out part of YouTube for example spin off or spin out part of nest take that
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.840]   Which is a danger. Don't you think Matthew if you're up starts to think about about saying let's break up Google because it's too big
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840]   Which we hear all the time
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.120]   Then then then does this beg that question?
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.240]   Mike else you haven't had a chance to weigh in let's let Mike
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.040]   Tell us what he's okay, and then I'm gonna tell you how you're all wrong go ahead
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:54.560]   Well first of all first of all this is a groundbreaking move because I think I believe that alphabet right now has three employees and
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.280]   their valuation Larry
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.760]   Sergey and and more at the yeah, yeah, and Dave Dave drum
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   I think maybe it's five or six even if it's ten
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.900]   Billion dollars, but they have all the valuation of all the companies and so from evaluation per employee or an employee
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.040]   It's very high. It's very high. So and that's a completely irrelevant point
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.960]   But interesting nonetheless. I think there are other reasons that make that I agree with both of you actually
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.480]   I think that this makes a ton of sense. I don't think there's reason for cynicism and
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.560]   There are reasons they didn't mention I think one of these for example is
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.840]   For example when they bought nest they told Tony Fidel we would keep it independent like a completely separate company
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.680]   And that's been a little bit of a challenge
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.440]   It's a challenge because you have a
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.520]   other
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:45.040]   exact and and also there are other divisions within Google who would like that status but just because they weren't acquired under the same
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.020]   Circumstances and so this sort of normalizes all this but I think one of the least appreciated
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:55.760]   Benefits of this is the timeline issue if you compare like two extreme examples like nest and
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.600]   Calico, okay, nest is selling products right now. They have 2.0 3.0 products right now
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.280]   They are actively shipping and developing new products is a going concern Calico is like in the year
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.680]   3000 we will alleviate death
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.800]   And so the timelines of those two
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:20.640]   Enterprises are so out of whack with each other that that each of these organizations seems to be based on
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.400]   timeline for the to a very large extent. What is the timeline that these?
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.040]   initiatives and projects and and products are going to come online and be developed and so I think that's a very
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.280]   liberating fact and we talked about Google's gigantism
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.920]   Jeff mentioned it, but
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   This is a company that not only doesn't know how big things are going to be they want things to be as big as they can possibly be and every container
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.560]   I've been farm-sitting this week. I've been taking care of somebody's farm. Imagine a farm then
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.720]   So it lets you have chickens and you have cows and you have goats and pigs and everything and they're all in the same cage
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.840]   That's one thing if you right-size all the cages
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.640]   Then you have a much healthier ecosystem all the animals can be free to do it
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:11.120]   You think Senator Pachara was about to pick Ruth Porat's eyes out? Yes, I am a peck and it was really getting bad
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.120]   We're gonna have to slaughter one of them
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.640]   But at your point, but I think you're like your point about the CEOs
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:24.120]   But those operating units having CEOs is a big one that a bunch of people have made that it makes it easier to retain people
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.000]   It makes it easier to offer people things because they're going to be a CEO of an actual operating subsidiary
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.600]   Not just a part of Google, you know the thing that makes all the money
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.720]   I think that's a bigger problem than people appreciate it's not just CEOs. It's CFO's. It's it's all right now
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   It's not but eventually I presume though
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.360]   Divisional habits on sea levels. Yes, and it's and they have been bleeding employees over the last year or so Google has been losing
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.000]   Sure, wouldn't you rather be the CFO of Galico?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.880]   Then a low-level employee at Google there they're basically saying you know
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.120]   They're you know, they're implying that if you want to do a startup
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:05.720]   Don't leave Google and start a startup start a new company under alphabet and and will you know
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   Retown the talent zone. I think it's brilliant all the way around you know
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.520]   One thing I wondered about which I which I wrote about I'd like to get your guys thoughts
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.600]   Why didn't why didn't YouTube become a separate subsidiary like Nez?
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   I think I mean it's because they don't want to
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.440]   YouTube from from a business perspective YouTube very much belongs with Google because
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:32.360]   Absolutely because it's it's an algorithmically based advertising business exactly the the signals are harvested and
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.880]   From YouTube and signals from search and other places are used in YouTube to provide relevant results and stuff
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.400]   It's it's all about the algorithms and the advertising yep
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.360]   I absolutely agree, but I think you could make I think you can make just as strong an argument that it should be its own thing
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   I mean it wants to become much more than just the search engine. It wants to become much more I think then just
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.880]   Regulatory issue that Google faces most strongly the issue of promoting its own properties in search
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.400]   One of the issue I mean from my point of view
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.520]   I'd love to see Google get I've said this many times get out of the content business. Why not spin off YouTube?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   But I have this argument regularly. It's not really in the content businesses in the content serving business
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.840]   It doesn't own the content it wants to be in the content business
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.600]   It wants to be in any business can be generated with algorithms, but the reason people are concerned
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.760]   You know it's not crazy to think that YouTube would have been spun out as a separate company because it was already a subsidiary
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:40.480]   It already has a CEO right you know so it is surprising in that sense. I think I think you guys are overthinking this
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.200]   Here's what I think this is all about you were professionals
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:51.560]   Here's what I think this is all about and I and I do believe them when they say this has been something they the story is that
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   Salman Kamengar came to
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.480]   The board years ago like several years ago and said you know you guys should think about this
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.320]   And then they've been chewing on it and something like this doesn't happen overnight
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.720]   It's probably been in the make works for a year or so, but here's what I really think is happening
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.040]   I think what really happened is that Larry wants to give wants to step down once
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.560]   Sundar Pichai to be CEO and
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.000]   Because I think Larry's tired and he even kind of implies this tired of taking meetings about search and ads
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.160]   Yeah, you don't want to go to those meetings anymore
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   But he knows it would be a big hit if if he said I am gonna
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.280]   I'm going to become executive chair and
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:35.160]   Because truthfully then this is my question. Couldn't you do everything they've done without this compartment?
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:42.520]   This is just what you totally there's a reorg many many companies have done this Google themselves done this Larry is too big for the normal
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.040]   Route the normal route you become a VC. I think this is hand waving
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.720]   I think this is all saying pay no attention to the fact that I'm gonna step down and send her's gonna be the CEO
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.400]   I think you're right to the right in the tactical view Leo
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.280]   But in the strategic view I think they're also trying to build a company for the ages and if I agree
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.840]   I'm not saying that there aren't some city area benefits. Yes. Yes, they're absolutely subsidiary benefits. They're also subsidiary
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.880]   negatives
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.400]   Risks because they've they've said specifically they're gonna provide Q4 reports for every
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   segment and this makes Larry as somebody said a capital allocator. That's really his job
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.720]   And that's what he says is job to your point. It's it's you know, he is a VC and not we will rigorously
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.320]   This is this is the salient paragraph alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:38.560]   Independence in general our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business with Sergey and me in service to them as needed
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:45.200]   That means not running it. I mean service means oh you got a you need some money. Let me get the checkbook out
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.280]   He will rigorously handle capital allocation rigorously handle capital allocation
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:56.400]   That term rigorously is interesting sounds painful and work to make sure each business is executing well
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.800]   We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business and we'll determine their compensation in addition with this new structure
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.320]   And this is interesting that you pointed out this doesn't have to be done
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.160]   But they've said with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.160]   Google financials and we provided separately than those for the rest of the alphabet businesses as a whole they don't have to do that
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   Sounds to me like there may be this will facilitate spinouts by doing spin-offs by doing that
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.000]   When you say risks leo when you say risks think about this
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.600]   So now you have larry and sir gay sitting there
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.520]   With a big pile of money that google has produced on the jet
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.760]   That's still the growth engine
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.320]   And and they've got all these CEOs they're no longer vp's of such and such a unit
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:47.360]   They're now CEOs of operating subsidiaries who have to come and say I want x percent of google's money
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:56.240]   To do this and then larry and sir you have to slice up the dough and hand it out to those ceos it could actually create a lot more
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.960]   Problems, I'm a
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.320]   Is that is that
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.000]   I don't I think we'll be past the idea that larry is a one-hit wonder but let's just say that his hits are behind him
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.440]   Just just the sake of argument here then you're right. What is he 43? I don't know. I'm just saying he has no
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.480]   If you were in the nba maybe okay, let me
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.760]   Fully that larry pays doesn't matter. He's gonna live forever
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.240]   It's let me be clear. He's many more huge incentive
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.200]   I'm just trying to say structurally that then then man his point is right then all you're doing is divvying up google's money
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.480]   um
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   for the future
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:36.880]   But the other pressure on google which has been tremendous is to diversify and that's a key part of this is 96 to 98
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.360]   Percent of their revenue is advertising so by taking alphabet and by getting into new businesses
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.440]   Which may take a while to grow but new businesses that are not ad supported purely
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.720]   Then that diversifies the corporation as a whole and that's been another huge pressure on them
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:56.800]   Um, but it only works if they create new businesses and that's highly risky like all entrepreneurial ventures are
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.920]   Uh, and that's where they were they are so they're gonna allocate capital but but unlike just a war and buffet
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.200]   They're not gonna just buy things they're gonna build new things and build entirely new industries high risk
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.720]   I return I growth. Um, so so I think in fact, that's the audacious goal
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.120]   Then the divvying up of google's money
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.400]   Shouldn't be an issue because there should be lots more money to be made by all these other divisions
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.880]   In the meantime in the meantime instead of having operating vp's of this and that they have a bunch of ceo's
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.840]   Who are all now who all now think i'm the ceo this damn thing. I don't have to you know
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.960]   I should be running x company. Oh my guess is that bag Larry if they're gonna get good ceo's
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.760]   They're gonna let them do what they they're gonna give them total autonomy
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.680]   Right and if they make money then they'll have it'll be no it is it's it's serfdom
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.480]   It is it's a feudal system. It's a feudal system and he's the lord of the manor. Yes. Yeah, but that's listen
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.680]   That's guys that's drive work in many companies where uh newspaper chains
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.960]   Where you had 20 newspapers each had a ceo, but you know what they did every month they gave a bag of money to hq
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   Right and hq decided what to do with that. That's quite normal
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.040]   Well good. That's what's gonna happen and will Larry have to go to meetings
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.800]   Only if he wants to oh, I'll leave it's on the jet. Oh leo meetings come to larry
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.440]   Yeah, so my point do you do not think that this is retirement for larry page
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:21.040]   No because I think that I think it's retirement from the day to day of google
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   I think it's I think it's larry retrained was youth to build new google
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.360]   Yeah, well it's a promotion retirement means you get to do what you want if you want to putter in the garden
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.400]   You get to putter in the garden. Yeah, but he's gonna have higher goals than that
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.880]   He's gonna go of course he is but it's to me it was it was I mean if i'm larry page
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.600]   I'm sitting here. I'm going god. I have to take another meeting on what color the home page banner should be
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.320]   Or your regulators up our ass. Yeah sundark. Could you take this uh call for me?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   He doesn't want to run a day to day
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.160]   But who's gonna referee between all those CEOs who's gonna decide where that google money goes
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   There's a
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   That's goo George Bush is the decider larry is the allocator. Isn't though what where's what's serge's role in all of this
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   What's his role now?
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.640]   Project x big ideas. See sir. See in my opinion, sir. Gated this a few years ago. Yeah
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.040]   And that larry's looking at sir
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.560]   Man, he's got this project x he's having fun. He's zooming around doesn't wear shoes rocket ships
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   And me i'm sitting in the meeting about what color the google banner is can we pay for his fun?
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.720]   So he's I bet you he's you know, he's gonna watch his philanthropy see what happens with his philanthropy. He's got a foundation
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.400]   Uh watch what happens with uh project x plus one the larry page
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.880]   version I think this and but what would have happened if if instead of this
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:50.640]   Google went through some sort of reorg and larry said now i'm going to be the go join the board and sundar pachias the ceo google
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.600]   Stop how would the market have reacted to that now? Yeah
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:59.280]   Yeah, no, I agree. I agree and he has handed sundar a kind of you know
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:05.360]   A ball of something something that might be unpleasant. I mean do you think sundar put was pushing for this
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.280]   I don't think so, but maybe I think i'm going to soon dar was proving himself from day one
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.480]   I think sundar the respect that sundar clearly has
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:21.680]   In in that world is and that's the world where there's some you know, there's some back by sundar is people loved he's very impressive
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.160]   So the other one he wanted to be a ceo
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.240]   Omid
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.160]   Is is this is what's interesting to me is omid who's all so much respected who came back
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.120]   In important roles one of the stories said that he now becomes an advisor to alphabet and google
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.080]   That was I don't know what i don't know the terminology behind that. Yeah, so that
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.800]   So here's here's my theory on all this you're gonna love this jeff. Um, so my theory is this has been in the works for several years
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.520]   I've heard up to four years
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.240]   and I believe that they
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.480]   Had a feeling there was a couple of executives that thought that they would end up in the coveted ceo role
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.440]   One of them was vikindotra the other one is sundar pachai
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.400]   And vikindotra made a big power play with google plus by taking everything under his wing
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.520]   And key convinced larry and surrogate to allow him to connect everything to his projects
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.280]   And then at some we'll hear about this in 10 years when we read jeff d'arvers's book about this
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:24.320]   But at some point sundar pachai won that and that's why vikindotra left a year ago. That's exactly what happened. Yeah, that's really interesting
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:31.840]   Yep sundar took chrome chrome o s made it a success took and roid when roobin left made it continued its growth
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.640]   Yep, and and is quietly operating in the background making friends building businesses and uh one he won
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.280]   Yep, and there you know, this is his reward. Yeah, I don't know how much faith we should put in them
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.200]   But there are rumors that sundar had had at least one ceo offer
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:54.000]   Possibly more interesting. Oh, well michursoft wasn't he a contender for michursoft's they mentioned his name. I don't think he was
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.040]   Interestingly, although I don't know how much there is to that
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.840]   What would make you what a horrific step that would have been yeah
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.280]   Sundar we were gonna make you ceo, but enjoy the twitter
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:12.800]   You get a free account you get a free job. That would be the biggest. What was I think oh my god
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.840]   I could have had a
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.680]   had a
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.880]   Challenge do you think that's interesting you brought up. All me court astana yet. It's interesting that he went back just a few days ago
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.160]   All right, that's very interesting. He was their first business their first cfo
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.680]   And he went back to it was a physical but but but he went back well
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.280]   He's been working on for this summer, but Larry on august 10
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   August tense was two days ago said there's you know said he's now going to be a part of alpha
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.480]   But yes, but what was the um
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.920]   Oh, had started named for us when then who was in charge of revenue? Uh, he left the company to become an investor
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.560]   And is for
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.160]   He cash decash ora. Oh, yeah cash ora. So when the cash left, right
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.280]   That's what I think omead kind of came back into the chief revenue role
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.560]   And so I don't know whether omead was also another candidate for ceo of google. I doubt that
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   I think it was pretty clear a year ago that it was it was sundar
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.920]   Uh, but omead is also much respected. He's staying he's an advisor a year ago. Larry page said in a little bit
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.040]   We're going to make this alphabet thing. I'm going to step down
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.760]   And I need you as part of a senior management team to help me do this reorg my here's what I think
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.360]   Omead was doing it all behind the scenes. This was who was working on it
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.600]   Uh, okay. Okay, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. He was the guy to do it, right?
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.880]   Consticlieri. Yeah, yeah
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.960]   Yeah, he went off to a cottage much like matthews in the wood with a lake
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.840]   And he spent a year doing this if I did that I wouldn't get anything done in fact makes me wonder what matthew is up to
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   No, I think here's I mean if you're gonna pick a guy to do that
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.240]   Somebody from out. I like that that now makes us like couldn't forget because omead is so respected there
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.360]   And so like there like sundar help us do the reorg
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.840]   Yep, and I bet you the kind of what's underlying it is hey, I want to do this day today
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.240]   Uh, but I don't want it to look bad to the market and to investors that
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.760]   Google's now going to be a rudderless ship with who's this sundar guy
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.400]   I want to make this look good and I think alphabet makes it all look at the stock market. Yeah
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   Now what are there any this is something I don't know maybe you guys do because I'm not a
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.280]   Financial guy, but are there tax or financial consequences benefits
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:28.560]   Or is it just an obtuary where you got to figure the roof flat higher was critical to this. Yeah
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.160]   And when you think Anderson left because of this
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.760]   No
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.600]   I don't know, but I would imagine the roof had to be key to not any restructuring. Who was the cf?
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   Yeah, I think her hiring was
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.840]   Because of this Anderson was Apple. She's perfect for this. Yeah, I was gonna say who was the guy before for that
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.760]   She got hired in the spring
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.560]   Was the
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.720]   She joined in may
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   Replacing you'll find this
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.200]   If only there was a site five years at Morgan Stanley
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.960]   Um
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   Chat room. Come on chat room. You're feeling us. Come on. Come on. You can do it Patrick. Pishette
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.240]   Oh, yeah, I see
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.960]   Patrick this shit. Yes. Oh, you evidently did apparently, you know did a good job people liked him
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.040]   So but wasn't the kind of power when Ruth was hired she was seen as a powerhouse hire. Yeah
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.720]   Uh, and since then the results have been making people happy and she's got it into shape
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.360]   And I saw I think the structuring but she had a huge role in the structuring and so now to answer your question
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.440]   You know, it's depends on how it's done
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.760]   I mean because now what now what's possible is you could set up nest as a Dutch company
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.440]   Uh
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:48.240]   You know that is one of the financial issues google and a lot of big tech companies have now is that most a lot of their cash is overseas to avoid
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.160]   US taxation
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.560]   That's not repatriated if repatriated it would take a lot of uh a lot of loss
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.600]   So what can you do? Can you create an and you know
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:04.240]   They they invested a hundred million dollars a year in europe and a vc fund which I still think is is a little small
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.320]   For what what they need to do but uh they're doing interesting things there
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.680]   You could imagine them creating entirely new divisions new companies rather new companies. Yeah in uh,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.200]   India and europe in south america in asia
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.240]   um, and uh that they they could then use that capital
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.320]   Expatriated for another company there. I don't know. I'm not I'm believing I'm no fan potential person either
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.600]   Certainly not a tax person. They could attach bags of cash to balloons and float them across borders
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.600]   But when you think about it and those balloons would provide internet access
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.680]   Yes, along with a cash
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.840]   But it feels to me like and I don't know this either
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.640]   But a holding company is probably going to be treated significantly differently tax wise than
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.520]   An operating company like google. I don't know that but it feels to me like there's got to be a difference there
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.840]   Maybe there is a benefit
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.640]   Well, a lot of these companies will probably lose a lot of money
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.520]   And their attacks benefits for losing money
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.600]   So who knows that that's interesting. Yeah
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:10.400]   Got it. Is that kind of stuff is black art. Yeah, I mean calico is going to be on welfare for like a decade
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.840]   Well, that's why you don't want to i'm puzzled because you don't really want to tell people how much
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.360]   These companies are losing because they're all no, but don't forget the smartest analysis analyst know
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.680]   The losses are a good thing when you have a higher
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.400]   Great. Yeah. Yeah
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.920]   So so this makes it easier to balance so that goes back to your question of of
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   You know christmas with that elary
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.000]   Um, how you know how much is in my stocking
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.200]   That that's not just about google revenue is also about the tax structure here
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.880]   I'm reading an article in the mit technology review by robert hoff
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:52.560]   He says google's new structure has few historical precedents and texts are outside it and that it's a fairly risky
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.280]   Proposition he says and he quotes a number of
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.080]   experts in finance and management
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.920]   that uh, this they're going to have to spin off
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.160]   Uh, the companies that are worth something
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.440]   In particular these pieces that do not perform need to become independent companies in the reasonably near term
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.560]   Not just remain part of larry and sargaze big technology sandbox the strategy
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.840]   Only makes sense if they spin these companies off
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.520]   Investors want to see results before we're dead
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.160]   And calico
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.200]   While it's trying to prolong life forever is not likely to see results until people are dead
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   Nobody's holding companies
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.920]   Holding companies typically traded at a at a you know, sometimes a very sharp
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.520]   Uh, discount right to operating company. So there's going to be
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.440]   Eventually a discount on the stock the timing of the reorg
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:51.760]   This is a different company. This is not as we've already said it's not buffet. It's not
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.520]   um
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.120]   uh png
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   It's a different beast
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.160]   But in fact, it's even more risky. I mean bircher Hathaway is is a is a day at the beach compared to
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.200]   Amen, but that's a big big big return
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   This is this is the theory in uh in this article is that some of the
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:16.160]   Investments that google made are about to cross they have passed the biggest risk point and are about to cross into profitability
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.440]   There are already according to a fellow at stanford's
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.800]   Rock center for corporate governance. There are already two or three possible googles in the portfolio
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.160]   They mentioned nest self-driving cards and project loon
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.120]   All of which have crossed the risk point
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.560]   Which means that they're that they would be a very smart thing to spin out
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.520]   And and if you i mean imagine if you did you did uh kind of calve three or four new googles at an alphabet
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.920]   Right, let's not forget how you can spin them out too is you don't have to spin them out and sell them and lose them
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.280]   No, you could just create new new capital by selling 10 percent of them. Yep
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.560]   To the mark rule yeah, and you thus create capital that's useful for the next new divisions
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.240]   And that's really what's possible here
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:03.440]   So this is article says that the companies that are going to make money need to be spun out
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.360]   Uh, then and finally concludes in any case the sweeping reorganization sets google on alphabet on a path
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.960]   That may be difficult to change in the future if it doesn't work
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.480]   Because it's more than simply a promise to report the financial results of google and the alphabet separately
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   It demonstrates their commitment, but it gives them less less flexibility in the future for better or worse
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.840]   Page and brin have made a bet on which they can't easily renew
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.800]   Well, it gives them less flexibility if they fail and it's a high state. They succeed. Yeah, it's a high state
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.600]   And that means you just that what where the name came from
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.080]   Alpha alphabets
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.760]   So alphab like in fact larry says that yes, he mentioned it's a bet to be the alpha company
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   Wall Street journal has a piece uh quoting a guy who says attacks and accounting experts says there are no
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   Obvious tax benefits. Okay
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.000]   Because it's really it's a reorg
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.440]   Yeah
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.640]   And I mean as long as you shift the stock over to alphabet which you've done
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.680]   Yeah, then it's just a reorg the naming doesn't make that much difference. Yeah, you know, it's amazing
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.640]   Other companies should look at google not
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.520]   Not because they did this but how they did it. Yeah, it's so much more exciting
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   Yeah, then a regular reorg if you just said we're gonna shift an operating unit over to this other thing
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.120]   No one would people would fall asleep during while you were saying that sentence
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.320]   But google has this cool name and it's got a new logo and it's it's this huge
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.720]   Future looking thing. It's basically just a restructuring. Well, is there a new logo? I haven't seen a new logo yet
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.000]   Uh, I don't know if they they have one uh anti bio came up as well because I want thank you
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.320]   I would just take candies. Yeah
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.640]   Um the the you know, the other issue the john pateon, uh, who's a newspaper executive?
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.880]   Matthew and I both know well
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.920]   Um
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.680]   had a really interesting tweet right afterwards who said that
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.000]   um
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.560]   What newspaper companies would have the courage to basically
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.720]   Isolate their past do that with a couple in the future
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.360]   And so in a sense, you know, you hate to imagine that google was just the past google's the old thing
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.800]   But the company didn't want you know part of what I said too was that google was seen too much as
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.960]   Justice search engine a search engine a search engine. I've long argued for years on this show
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.720]   No, it's much more than a search engine and it's much more even than an advertising behemoth
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.600]   It's a personal services company that moves past the mass market to treat people as individuals
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.920]   It's huge in that way and all these services
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.880]   Uh, uh, the bbc had me try to name every google service
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.720]   I could in 20 20 seconds and there's some mail and maps and so on and so forth
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.840]   There's so much there, but yes google is in a sense
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.120]   It's past if you took a newspaper company if they were if they spent a spun off the difference
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.280]   Is that google has a future and his papers don't but if you spun off that past
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.440]   and um
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.560]   Or not more isolated that passage it fenced that past and made the essence of the company the future
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.160]   That's really what Larry just did. He made the essence of this company his future, which is yet unknown
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.240]   And in a way, of course, john pate and tried to do that. I don't want to stop topic, but with digital media
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.440]   And unfortunately as as you pointed out print still produces a bunch of revenue
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.960]   But that revenue is declining dramatically. I mean 10 15
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.040]   Also requires that we have a future strategy exactly. Yeah, um
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.920]   But that's that's another show. Nobody's arguing the google is anywhere near the same position
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.120]   So exactly but but it is interesting that there was an effort to say
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.080]   Listen folks. We are you keep on thinking of us as a search engine
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.720]   You think of us that of that as a business where there's a hiccup in the ad rates you say oh my god
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.000]   You think of us that regular in regulatory terms. Oh my god
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.240]   You promoted us on search. Nobody was seeing google itself properly and still doesn't in and of itself
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.280]   I think but then they also didn't know what that would wtf to do with self-driving cars and
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.840]   And medical contact lenses and balloons and all this other stuff. It just didn't make it
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.360]   It does from the public point of view. It's streamline streamline. It's rationalizes the whole thing
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.120]   And so that brings up another question. Why not take android out of google and make that an operating subsidiary, too
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   Yeah, it feels like they kept all the good stuff. Yeah
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.240]   Sundar and I once again
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.640]   I'll take every i think i'd like to keep yeah, okay, look you take
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:20.720]   Uh the project loon, but i'll keep android is that okay and can i have the terminator robot too or is that too much?
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.840]   Yeah, no
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.160]   How about youtube i'll tell you what you keep calico i'll take youtube. How about that
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.600]   It was there where they put all the cards on the table and like have a Dutch auction for the uh parts
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.680]   They kept all the good parts. Yeah, do they keep any money losing divisions?
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.240]   90 of the money the companies that went into google that the new google
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:49.200]   Uh make 90 of google's revenue. I have an idea. It's almost all of it. Why don't I take twit
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.320]   And spin off
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:59.600]   Actually, uh, it is not an unheard of thing for instance
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.520]   If we're considering and we have been considering buying a building you wouldn't buy it as twit
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.360]   You would buy it as a separate operating division. You'd create a new llc
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.320]   And then why do you do that?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.400]   Another company you rent back to twit. Oh, I see right. Um, I don't understand you could get the url
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.560]   abc bfd
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   And it's be great
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.840]   The building would be owned by a numbered company listed in the came and i'm and i was typically
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.200]   This is this is this is not unusual at all in business
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.800]   In fact, uh, lisa's prior job, which was working for a massive development company every development
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   They did was a separate llc at one point. She was managing well over a hundred llc's
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:48.640]   So so that's very it's not a bad way to do things because it does kind of separate the structure up come to think of it
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   That's how trump runs his business. That's right
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.400]   That's everybody else is a loser. They're all stupid
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.800]   You're stupid
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.400]   The reason why people kept thinking of bircher Hathaway is that bircher Hathaway
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.680]   Started with the thing that makes the money, right?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.120]   And so there's this core business that just spins off vast amounts of cash, but it's very different, right?
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.280]   It's just a holding company, right? Right, but weren't so Warren invests that cash in other things. He doesn't build things
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.360]   He doesn't not try to cure cancer
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.520]   You know, he just buys a bit of like coca cola and a bit of derri queen and a bit of whatever
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.640]   But it's it's a similar strategy you have a money spewing
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.280]   Thing at the core and then that he gets doubled out to different things
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.760]   It's been great to watch everybody from danny Sullivan to you matthew to you jeff
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.240]   Kind of try to piece tease out the meaning in all this
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.120]   My favorite was when it first happened when the when the announcement first came out
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.520]   I happened to be looking at twitter
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.640]   Of course and uh because my eyes were
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.160]   Happened yeah, or is it just something you do all the so
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:02.800]   The first was the first things I saw were literally wtf with a bunch of exclamation mark
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.240]   Because the people because the first response was what the hell is going on? What does this even mean?
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.400]   What I don't get it that was my reaction. We were on the air when we got the word
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.000]   We were doing iOS today. My first reaction was that it was a joke or something like that
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.520]   Yeah, I got a reporter coming to me saying uh, I presume you've heard this. We want to talk to you about about this. I thought what
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.760]   I was driving so I literally pull off the road
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.400]   To go look at that. This is too big to just ignore and and get two and ten minutes
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.360]   Yeah, much we need self-driving cars jeff you could have just kept going you know what I think about I think of uh
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.640]   for years
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.280]   people called for microsoft to split into
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:47.120]   Two or three divisions, you know operating systems. Um, I can't even remember what they were now
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.880]   Um, and they showed up. They maybe they should have
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.360]   Maybe there would be more value now. I don't know
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:03.920]   Um, but this isn't quite the same thing is it because microsoft did do many a reorg in fact when such in a delicame and he vastly reorganized
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.640]   Uh, the company
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.080]   Google's been three reorgs before I think what people were thinking by was, you know, microsoft had
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:19.760]   Windows in particularly office as the thing that basically spewed out all the cash, right and they could have kind of
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:27.840]   Separated that and then had a weird cloud. Maybe I guess yeah where they tried new things like mobile and right of course
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.600]   They all that's the other thing. Where does the where does the whole cloud division of google go?
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.400]   That stayed in google, right?
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.080]   Yeah, yes
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.360]   That's it. I mean that that strikes me that could be a separate infrastructure company
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:46.480]   Really feels like the company we care a lot of people the number one tweet I got was what are you gonna call it this week in alphabet now?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.640]   Yeah, exactly a boy
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   Oh, you're a wick you're a wick
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:57.360]   There we go. Nice. I like to make an announcement
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.160]   How did you get that so fast
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.280]   Welcome to the new this weekend alphabet. It's wea
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.400]   Only we had to have a new logo this week in alphabet
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.880]   Yeah, do we have to tell the truth wea
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.960]   Yeah, I was handed that well handed that in a digital sense from Anthony right for the show
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   We're not gonna do that
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:27.920]   But we can if we want to we have the means to do it on the fly currently we have the technology
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.240]   I feel like
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.880]   Really what happened is that all the good stuff was kept at google
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.080]   So here's here's the way I look at it google is still google
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   And then what larry page did was he created his own private silicon valley where he is the one and only vc
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.640]   And everything else is a start. Oh, that's interesting
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.840]   So google is the company and then plus there are seven startups and they're gonna be
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:48:00.560]   But what does somebody with were 30 billion dollars like larry do when they retire they become a vc they play god
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.400]   Yeah, yeah
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.640]   But so one of the we're talking about self-driving cars though. It's gonna be really hard. It's like a gender switch
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.520]   It's you know, it's starting to call kaitlyn gender she
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.680]   What are we gonna say alphabet drive self-driving cars? We're still gonna say google self-driving car
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.120]   Well, are you gonna yeah, it's all good. Well, that's an interesting good point
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.920]   That doesn't have the same ring at all so that they only spin off moonshots
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:28.480]   No, because nasa is not a moonshot. They're startups. They're startups. Okay, but nasa is about youtube
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.120]   I mean nest nest and youtube are both operate
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:37.360]   Companies they have revenue they have but nest is a unicorn ish sort of startup be kind of a company
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:43.280]   It's pretty new. I mean, it's you know, listen youtube is still an advertising based listen google look at it this way
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.600]   Everything that's advertising based is in google
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.400]   Everything else is technology based in various ways more hardware based oddly
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.440]   Nest cars and so and so forth
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.040]   Biomedical stuff that's all hardware. That's off in new divisions. What about advertising is google
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.240]   Google fiber is spout Android doesn't fit that model at all and it should yeah
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.440]   What doesn't it's hard where I would have spun off android. I don't know and well. Yeah, I thought about that but android
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.040]   No, android there are things here that serve the google advertising exactly
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.600]   For years has been that mobile is a signal generator. Okay, and it is a signal generator because and so they need those to be tightly coupled
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.920]   They need to own it
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.240]   Well, but if you want to control it
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.080]   Uh, no because android here's married man matthew matthew here's married with there
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.280]   Um google coming out with a $50 phone
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.080]   There is no money to be made for the manufacturers for android. It's going to get worse and worse and worse for there
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.040]   So it's not going to be a very good company on its own, but it's an important
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.640]   Enabling technology for not only google but for everybody else to spread mobile
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.520]   So it's a necessary step, but it's not going to be a great business itself android's not going to never be a great business
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:53.120]   I do have a feeling though. I mean leo you were joking about this, but it feels to me like
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.760]   To some extent this reorganization says, you know google is
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.480]   Boring and not much is going on there and it's i'm sick of it
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   But it produces a bunch of cash
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:09.200]   So we'll just let sundar on it and it it kind of makes it feel
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.800]   You know it downplays google to some extent even though it does produce all the money sundar is going to surprise us
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:20.720]   Isn't it? I think sundar I think what larry larry has a vote of faith in sundar here that says that you're the junior larry
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.280]   But the key is it doesn't matter
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   Why what doesn't matter it doesn't matter if google goes up or down
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.800]   It doesn't not not to larry larry's larry's more interested in everything else it provides all the money
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.040]   Well, that's a good point, but he's got enough money
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.840]   Matthew what you're really asking is will google surprise us and innovate will it come up with a new android or a new chrome or anything?
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.000]   Maybe not I think will I think it will
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.040]   Well, but why what's the incentive to I guess the incentive would be then you might get your own company under the alphabet
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.880]   Right umbrella. Yeah, uh, yeah, you're also improving google's business and making expand again google started as that
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.280]   That's why i come on saying everybody still sees google's a search engine
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.840]   It wasn't even an ad company it became an ad company and then it became a platform company that became a
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:12.880]   Personal services company. Um, it became a navigation company people all these things that do fit together under the rubric of advertising supported personal services
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.840]   That's to me what google is and entertainment in the form of youtube
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.360]   um
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:23.040]   Uh and distribution in the form of youtube right but but it all to me fits together there and no there could be big surprises left
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.240]   but
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.800]   What if here's what i guess i'm saying is if sundar wants to start his self-driving planes
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.440]   He probably won't be allowed to because it just won't fit
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.280]   He's got to have something strategically that fits with google with google as a division and its mission
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.400]   Um, there's not an alphabet thin google would they ever spin off google?
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:52.160]   I think they might or part of it. Why not? I I I don't think they would simply because why would they they're
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:58.160]   Guzzillionaires and they love it and it's their life and I just think even if it made sense financially
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.400]   I don't think they do it doesn't create any more capital and they already have and that's in a capital market
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.800]   You spin off the other things that that are undervalued within it google's valued properly
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.120]   Somebody that shatram says yeah, but what happens to or cut it's gone?
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.160]   Take a break
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.600]   Actually what happens to google plus yeah
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.800]   Oh, there. Larry said that was the one comment that he answered in this entire discussion
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.680]   We still like it doesn't mean we're gonna keep it around. He said we still love it. We still love it
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.280]   I love it. We all love it. We all love it. Nobody's not saying we don't love it
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.040]   Just saying sometimes you have to put things down. It might be the loved one
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.440]   Well, that was part of the question too is the people said well, this requires larry to be uh, uh ruthless
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.600]   He's been ruthless. He's killed things. He's killed. Love it. He's been more than ruthless
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:50.160]   Yeah, it comes to his detriment. It requires him to not be required to do anything. He doesn't want to do
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   That's what I think i'm honest to god. I really think that yeah from a personal point of view. This is just larry retiring
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.240]   Yeah, not but retirement in the sense that a larry page retirement much like a circuit brain retirement
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.040]   Yeah, would be a very active retirement. He larry is bumping himself upstairs. Yes. Yeah
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.080]   Yeah, and had he not had he not split these companies out
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   It would have been a bad thing for the stock market oddly enough by doing it this way
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.320]   Unfortunately, he has somebody has a high quality sundae perchai which the market probably thinks very highly of
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:26.160]   He was able to add 5% to the mark to the who else we said it and sundar could have been candidates for ceo over the years
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.040]   Tim Armstrong there've been some but
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:36.000]   Sundar's really um shown that he can run a division. Yeah, he's not he's not what I would call inspiring
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.840]   He's boring. He's boring. Uh although my experience with him has been really i've been always been very impressed with him
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.800]   Very smart very charming. He's charming
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:50.000]   You know, I was I got an argument with him early on about whether kromo has made any sense at all
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.960]   And he instead of getting upset he was really listened and he was very coherent in his response
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.000]   And personally one word that the one word people tend to use is dependable
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Yeah, so not exciting right not but you can count on him
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.600]   Deliver so basically he's got the engine room
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.360]   Larry said I don't want to spend any more time down your shoveling coal
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.040]   Scotty scotty takeover. I'm going up to the bridge. Larry said beam me up to look at the stars
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:23.920]   Larry is is um is kirk and uh, sarah a is
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.520]   Spock fuck or vice versa, but who's oh, well, yo
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.920]   Who's suulu in this
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   Tony fidel
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.840]   Tony fidel
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.640]   Before we leave it let's let make one more note that the three
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.080]   Immigrants from india in this country running three is very amazing
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:44.720]   Yeah
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.760]   And one of one of our argument for changing our immigration structure
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.360]   To say that the amount of talent that we could have here if we weren't so self so short-sighted and stupid about this
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:57.920]   Prachai nadella, who's the third? Oh, I'm forgetting how suddenly was in this company
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.440]   I forgot. I'm spacing. Sorry. Sorry. I brought it up
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.680]   You want facts we don't do facts, but just too black
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.360]   I'll take a break. We'll talk about a mattress. You take an apple come back and then you'll know
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:20.320]   Our show today brought to you by casper. Oh, I love my casper an online retailer premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.080]   We uh, we we got casper for our guest room. We got cast. I mean we kind of went all in on casper
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.400]   We got casper for my son in college
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:34.720]   And there's our queen size casper now. This is nice because it comes in a fairly compact box
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:40.320]   So that's why I got it for my son in college. It was very easy to transport up three flights of stairs. No elevator
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.360]   Uh open it up and there he is it the the mattress opens up and it's beautiful. It's comfortable
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.600]   Combining latex and memory foam for uh both support and comfort just the right sink and bounce
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.520]   It's risk-free because even though you're buying it online
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.120]   You have a hundred nights to return it at no cost to you
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.160]   So you literally can sleep on it for a hundred nights. Say, you know, I decide I don't want this
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.200]   They will send a courier who will come and get it you you will have paid zilch
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.600]   You refund on all your money zero
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.240]   And then I think that they do is donated to charity
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.520]   Hmm, just kind of nice. You everybody wins. Yeah, except casper. You're not gonna you know what?

[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.520]   They're easy to move to sometimes you move a mattress or like a futon or something like that and you just can't
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.960]   These fold out these fold ups are moving easily there. They're real nice that way. Yeah, he really loves his casper
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.920]   He says the ladies do too. I don't know what that means. Yeah, don't he is
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.760]   Let's not go there
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.160]   That is though how they advertise on the harp's turn show. I know they do I know they do
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:34.000]   I had a waterbed in college. This is not a recipe. You wouldn't have for romance. Yeah
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:43.040]   It was terrible. You can't get a purchase. I had a california king-sized waterbed in high school
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it was like it was ridiculous. It was like a big balloon. Yeah, that you're sleeping on
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.080]   You never stops. It just it's like yeah, it's like it's like we're being on a ship
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.880]   We're not exactly we're close enough in age that this when we were that age. Yeah, I was in college. You were in high school
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.440]   That was the thing to have yeah
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:05.200]   It was it was awesome. It was a terrible idea. Yes, before the internet, right? Yeah, we didn't have there was no one to tell us
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.200]   Don't get it
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.760]   So there was no one to make fun of us
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:17.200]   So I have eight indian executives from forbs in the in the that's amazing run down in the top and the
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.880]   I've talked to five companies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, pretty amazing
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.040]   It is
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.520]   Uh, have we covered everything we need to say? Uh, yes, we still love google plus
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.840]   BMW will not sell alphabet dot com to alphabet
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.360]   But they got a bc dot x y z which is actually pretty good and you know what that means doesn't it give x y z dot x y z?
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.400]   Is he some legitimacy it does it does? It's past you would have said oh, yeah, go to twit dot x y z and people go
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.280]   What do you mean twit dot com dot x y z? What do you what do you mean?
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:54.720]   Now you just it's it's real who owns x y z google probably yeah, and no, I don't think so no, somebody else does
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:01.920]   Um, no chow room will tell us but before we go on leo if I may yes, I have a prepared statement about
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   The name google
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.920]   Nobody seems to know and this just shows the obviously the perfect place to talk about this
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.600]   Nobody seems to know what the origin of google is everybody tells the story that it's a it's a big number
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.840]   It's a one with a hundred zero oh g l or whatever the g o l yes
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:25.360]   G. L g o and there's another story that's in the rundown now about raman chandler who in 1953 wrote a letter to his agent that
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:29.440]   referenced google as a it's a pseudo scientific or sci-fi
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:35.360]   Style of writing what he mentioned. This is gonna get google fans going crazy because it makes fun of sci-fi
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   Yeah, it's worth reading for that raman chandler who is one of the great
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:45.680]   Genre writers mocking another genre. Yes, but that is not the origin either the origin is in 1919
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:53.840]   Okay. Yeah, okay. There was a cartoon in 1919. Yeah, and one of the characters of that cartoon was named
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.560]   um
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.160]   George google
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.360]   Let me see
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.720]   So the cartoonist was billy de back and he created a character 1919 named barny google
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.880]   Barney google. Yeah, honey google
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.360]   Jason if you can find that
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.600]   Yes, that's that's so yes that that was song there was a very popular cartoon and that song was written as a popular
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   song about the cartoon character
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.840]   And he had a horse named spark plug who's always trying to convince to win races and spark plug was a real game
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.320]   I'm playing the team right now at Jason if you have my idea
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:32.880]   I didn't wait for them to make that that arthy. Yeah, there you go. This is our new theme
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.400]   This sounds like the orchid. This sounds like the
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:43.920]   Suza version of it. There's actually a popular singer version of this. That's this is not it. Yes. No, this isn't it
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.320]   The only question is why would they choose that? Okay, so here's why they chose it
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:55.120]   They didn't choose it from the cartoon. They chose it from the mathematician, but the mathematician in 1940 his name was milton serata
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.960]   Uh, no, I'm sorry the night. There was a nine-year-old boy. There's a kid. Yeah
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.040]   Yeah, there was a nine-year-old boy named milton serata and his uncle was a mathematician
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.800]   Edward casner that's right Edward casner went to the kid and said give me a give me a great name for a really big number
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.080]   Yeah, and the kid who's a fan of the cartoon said google
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.880]   And but here's the interesting I knew that as a kid. I knew that story as a kid. I remember that
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.440]   Okay, but he spelled it properly. He they right the original the original barney google
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.840]   The google spelled g o o g l e and the mathematician changed the spelling to g o o g o l
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   For 10 times 10 of the hundreds. Yeah, uh, I don't know
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.720]   But the origin is a cartoon. It's not I remember as a kid
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.160]   We all thought you know, oh, that was the largest number is a one with a hundred zeros after it and uh
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.720]   Huh, why would we think that as kids? Well, why not a million zeros? Yeah, why why that? Yeah, but that's what it was
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.120]   so
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.360]   Given larry and sergeis obvious knowledge of that. I think that
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.640]   Did they have they ever spoken out? Did you ever ask them jeff why the name? Oh
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.480]   By the way, this is funny because uh
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.880]   If you read this bit uh from ramen chandler
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   He was a letter to his agent
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.640]   In which he's kind of he says did you ever read what they call science fiction? It's a scream
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:26.160]   It's written like this quote. I checked out with k19 on ada baron three and stepped out through the chromiolite hatch
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.800]   On my 22 models serious hardtop
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.920]   I cocked the time jector in secondary and waited through the bright blue mandagrass
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.640]   My breath froze into pink pretzels. I flipped on the heat bars and the brilless ran swiftly on five legs
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.000]   Using their other two to send out crylon vibrations the pressure was almost unbearable
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.200]   But I caught the range on my wrist computer through the transparent
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.400]   Sysocytes I pressed the trigger the thin violet glow was ice cold against the rust colored mountains
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.920]   The brilless shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast stepping on them with the poll techs
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.720]   But it wasn't enough the sudden brightness swum me around in the fourth moon had already risen
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.800]   I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and google had told me it wasn't enough
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.880]   He was right
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   They pay for this crap as
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.480]   Freeman Chandler nice google told me
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.520]   It wasn't enough. It was enough. I think google's a thing in this but a person
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.600]   Apparently he uh, he he's uh done the same thing with tv. This is a good article
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.840]   Could you know a little a little kudos to Vlad savav? Yeah, it was it was a cool article writing in the verge
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.120]   So going back to google, sorry
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.720]   Uh, it was really no don't apologize. Believe me
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.600]   The Wall Street Journal 2004 that that mentions built in serrata
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.960]   Okay, has who came up with google and it says that casner so
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.920]   uh
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   His great niece
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.480]   Says she thinks casner tweaked the spelling to avoid trademark issues
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.280]   Hmm makes sense. Yeah, but but there's no interview with larry and syruge about this
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   No, it doesn't have been able to talk
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   They've never been uh
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.920]   Was there ever a case of the owner of bernie google having a fight here who all who was born google
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:25.040]   Apparently casner thought about suing google at one point. Um, really? Yeah
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:33.120]   Did he trade mark which is odd should have sued them for a google dollars? Yeah, i'll take one did i 100 damage
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.720]   Is there anything else in talk about are we done?
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.440]   Uh, everything pales, uh secondary to alphabet
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.000]   Um
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.520]   We did we mention last week and red one is being relaunched apparently
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.760]   Uh, it was a kind of a flop the idea of selling a hundred dollar phone
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   In developing nations apparently that's still too expensive
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.120]   Yep, they're going to relaunch it with phones less than 50 bucks
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:08.320]   Which might even still be too expensive even as low as 30 for the range they're targeting now is 30 to 50 dollars in india
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.920]   Just india is where they're starting and uh
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:20.400]   I just can't imagine how you make that happen. I mean I am so impressed by this moto g. Yeah, but that's a 200 dollar phone
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.360]   Yep
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.920]   Although that's what they charge. I wonder
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.680]   what Jason what did you guys have to say on on uh android about about the verizon
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   ending the
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.080]   No more subsidies babies. You know, we didn't actually talk about verizon last night
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.600]   So we talked about adding an item on every other show so yeah, yeah, bet
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.480]   We spent a lot of time on alphabet as well
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.000]   That's that that's a model for reducing the cost of the phone is that kind of subsidy structure
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.160]   But it's just that scale doesn't work in india obviously
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:56.960]   Yeah, well, uh, that's one point which is that subsidized phones are kind of a unique to the united states, uh, yes
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.600]   Situation so because it's a scam
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.120]   Yes, it would be prohibited by any sensible regulators. Yes. Yes, um or consumer marketplace. Yeah
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.720]   Well, yeah, that's an interesting thing. Why do consumers put up with this?
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.760]   Do they not know it's a scam? They do not know they think you know it's short-term thinking they think well
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.360]   I get a cheap so only 200 bucks right and and they think it's subsidize
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.080]   It's not a subsidy that everybody calls it a subsidy a subsidy is when money comes from somewhere else
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.960]   And comes to you a subsidy is not where
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.600]   Uh, where you pay for it
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.440]   Later, it's not a line. It's not a line item on your bill
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.680]   It's you I mean it will be that's why it works because it's all it's all muddled in there
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.960]   But if you let's say you spend an extra 25 dollars per month on your bill
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:46.160]   Uh for the two-year contract. Yeah, okay after two and a half years you keep paying that 25 dollars
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:51.600]   And after another year they know that every single month. It's it's a wonderful business model
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.160]   It's because it clears the scam when you
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.440]   Change your plan and they say oh by the way, that's gonna be another two years. Yeah, yeah, it's very
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.680]   Well, I like it to the dry cleaner who gives you a bag when you first start using the dry cleaner with their name on it
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.880]   And then you say after a year, hey, uh, thanks very much, but i'm gonna go across the street and they say oh, that's fine
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.880]   But they'll be a hundred fifty dollars for the bag
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.080]   Yeah
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080]   We have an early termination fee here
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:22.000]   Cleaners, it's like your cable company your cable company rents you your router or your modem or whatever
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.480]   And it's 15 dollars a month
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.280]   You've paid for that thing 15 times by the time, you know a couple of years
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.680]   Actually cable companies in the us. I don't know how it is in Canada, but in the us they're even worse than that
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.560]   They actually do have early termination fees
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.840]   So if you sign up for a deal as I did an internet deal
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:44.800]   You have to have that runs for a year with Comcast if you and I went and I said well
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.880]   I've got business service class service now. I want to cancel mine. They said well, okay, but that's good cost you 150 bucks to early
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.360]   termination fee
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.600]   Well, do you guys have when you
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.800]   Like let's say you want to get out of your cell phone contract. You have to buy out the remainder of the contest. Yes
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:08.240]   I mean that's an early term ETF and uh, what's what I think what's broken this is that the number four carrier
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.400]   I maybe number three or number four carry T mobile
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.120]   Um, and I guess sprints sort of started doing this too started saying we'll pay your
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:22.400]   Fees to move to T mobile and that started the whole crumbling of the zettifers and then T mobile went to that month to month
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.480]   No subsidized phones
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.560]   And Verizon is now doing it. I can only imagine AT&T and sprint will do the same
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:34.160]   Soon there's a perverse logic to it if you think about it though because you're essentially screwing over
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.840]   A customer you've already lost. So what's it? Why not? Why not take a parting shot and get an extra hundred squeeze another 150 bucks
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.840]   Out of them. They're leaving anyway
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.960]   So making this all explicit is certainly gonna put price pressure on phones apple will never go down
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.360]   No, right apple stony 650
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.560]   But uh, but this this moto g and even the moto x the the high end moto is less than is what 400 bucks
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.280]   But this moto g is every bit as as far as i'm concerned is the same as the original moto x
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.960]   For 200 bucks. It's faster snap here in fact snap here
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.720]   I actually went in the apple store. I there's there's various things happening here and there and everywhere
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.160]   I I really should have an iphone. I really should be able to use it too. You should
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.960]   Yeah, you should but jesus, you know, so I go in and look at the at the c the five c that she was waiting to get
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.840]   450 bucks and it's not a fault that that moto moto g and it's three years old
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.240]   what exactly
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:34.000]   That's outrageous. Well, you know the new apple funds are coming out next month, which means the old ones will be reduced
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.120]   Still let me read it for what five hundred fifty dollars a minute
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.440]   See, you know, I wonder if this is going to impact apple this loss of this subsidy
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.600]   The the fact that you'll know how much that good I think it will
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.480]   And I think the chinese economy and and and all that is going to affect them. I think I think apple's in for another rough year or two
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.120]   Comparatively speaking they'll do fine. Don't worry about apple folks that that would be fine
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.240]   but
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.440]   I think that they had a big spike because of china a big spike because of their giant phones
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.480]   And that was a blip. I don't think that was a trend. It was an aberration. Yeah, it wasn't. Yeah
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.920]   Yeah, there's this kind of you tend to think of apple as being
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   Home run after home run after home run in fact they had a few hits they had a few home runs then they had a grand slam
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:25.040]   But uh, you know, I I don't think the watch is uh is even a home run. I don't think the the ipad maybe is a home run
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.240]   They don't they don't have another grand slam in their back. Yeah a big
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   Big ipad isn't gonna save the new apple tv isn't gonna say in them the i don't know the home automation is not gonna save them
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.720]   I don't know what okay. So no no back that up to if I made a google for a second is that is that what if
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.000]   You look at what leery because because what was google google was leery and seregae's inspiration
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.520]   since then
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:55.680]   The other great inspirations of the company didn't really always flow from them whereas at apple everything had to flow from steve
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:04.400]   True. Yes, just throwing that out. Yeah, so i'm just trying to think about it. It's not from steve flow through steve. He certainly
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.760]   In modern era ceos was the biggest control freak I think of any if you wanted to get your product idea to market
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.040]   You had to go through steve sim. Yeah, but if you look at you know gmail didn't come from leery and seregae
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.560]   Advertising didn't share
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.640]   Yeah, I mean all those things well even uh, you know
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:30.800]   Google plus vikkendotra had to go on a several year lobbying campaign right to get that to to go through yep
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.160]   It's interesting that one of the when I was talking about the the odds that google might
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:44.000]   Buy twitter especially since you know, they've been kind of de-emphasizing google plus to some extent
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.840]   Maybe so the theory was well, maybe this will make it more likely they're gonna buy twitter one of the responses was
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.120]   It's not a leery sized problem. So basically
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:59.760]   Larry doesn't give a head about that's that's the equivalent of horse and well saying I don't get out of bed for less than 10,000
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.960]   Well, that's kind of the writing on the wall. We maybe should have paid more attention than that
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.600]   Larry doesn't isn't interested in the minutia the day by day minutia
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.480]   Well, I also think google plus is from an era where everybody was freaking out that
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:22.800]   Facebook was taken over the world of course facebook is taking over the world but not necessarily entirely with facebook.com
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.280]   Now they're going after youtube they're going after the messaging business they're going after all these other things
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.400]   But there was a period of time there where facebook was directing all the tra- where social is social network
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.680]   Social networking was viewed for about a year as the only way that in the future
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.600]   You would be able to direct traffic and get eyeballs and do all that kind of stuff now. We kind of know
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.800]   Yeah, there's lots of ways to do that. It wasn't really the big scary
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.440]   Doomsday are they not I mean that's exactly the risk for google. I think is
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.400]   social it just keeps climbing as a
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.640]   Means of referring traffic and as a means for people to find things to find content google
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.920]   So google plus and I don't want to say anything bad about it
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:09.120]   Google plus has not achieved some of the you know goals that that it said out to achieve what else does google have?
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:16.960]   I mean look at instagram or whatsapp or facebook has you know four out of the top 10 ios apps in the world
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.240]   It's got
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   billions of users for text messaging and photo sharing and what what does google have to compete with that?
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:33.440]   Google google has android and and and google now and but android is spinning out of its control. Yes problem. Yeah, yeah, google now is great
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.880]   um
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   I feel like uh
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.080]   Okay, let's take a break because I want to ask about messaging. Yeah, um because I feel like that is
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:47.440]   Potentially fumbled opportunity on google. Yes. Yeah, the future
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.560]   Yeah, and I feel like messaging it's very clear now that messaging is the app that you need at you know need to own right now
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.720]   Yeah, but let's take a break and talk about that. We also uh, we've got news the moto x
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.880]   Uh, we'll now be available during september 3rd. Moto rilla just tweeted that
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:08.480]   I just bought my one plus two thanks to you jeff jarvis. I bought it on uh, I bought it on tuesday
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.200]   Says 15 to 20 days before it ships. I'm still not sure which to buy still gonna figure it out. I've been looking at that
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.680]   I love that I don't have to think about it. I mean while there's advantages and disadvantages on the one hand
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.440]   I don't have to decide I just buy everything on the downside i have to pay for it all
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.560]   That's not an inconsiderable amount of no, I would love to see that budget
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.520]   I shabunga tinga. This is the worst time you break up you break up again for those numbers
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.840]   Right. I even not only have to buy it, but then I have to use them
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.720]   And you know what 20 i'm getting 20 hours battery life in the moto g
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.320]   I don't want to give it up
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:53.600]   Even though it's a I made a butt-ass ugly choice of colors. Oh, come on burgundy. What is that burgundy in line? Yeah
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.520]   It's it seemed like a good idea at the time
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:04.160]   Our show today brought to you by linda.com learning is a lifelong thing

[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.840]   excel or google sheets
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.000]   Or sharpen your seo skills. They've got so many courses and when new stuff comes out
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.320]   They're ready when windows 10 came out two weeks ago day and date they had windows 10 courses because they work with the publishers
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.600]   Now if you've always wanted to learn to code coding by the way
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:55.840]   Everybody should learn it, but it's a great hobby. I mean there's lots of benefits, you know rigorous thinking and you know
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.080]   You can get a great job, but it's also fun
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.360]   And linda makes this fun new courses include java essential training
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.840]   design patterns with python
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.680]   Advanced responsive layouts with css flexbox
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.440]   Uh, there's a great multi-course series called code clinic
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.760]   I've mentioned this before they take a come a single challenge and they solve it in a bunch of different languages including cseep
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.840]   Sharp c++, but a php and java script and ruby
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.040]   Uh, they've got r now. I mean it's really cool
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.040]   Linda lyn d a dot com. I do all the photography courses
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:36.320]   Lisa and I both do that because it's kind of our hobby and some of my favorite photographers teach at linda.com
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.480]   That's another thing I like about linda the best teachers
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.280]   Almost always working professionals
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.240]   The videos are very well shot so it's easy to watch you can learn at your own pace
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.360]   You can watch from beginning to and or just a little bit here or there
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.880]   You can even search the transcript find the answer to something you're trying to figure out and watch the video from that point
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.080]   You can even download the tutorials and watch them on the go on your android or iOS device
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.600]   And here's a pro tip for people who have who want to do a tablet
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.000]   It's a lean back learning experience. You get kick back on the couch you do tom cast it
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.640]   Oh, yeah, nice kick back get a nice beverage and a giant hamburger
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.360]   And sit there and enjoy yourself because it's really fun
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.200]   That's a good idea because like for the photography courses
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.920]   You kind of want to have let's say lightroom on your lap top and you're sitting with it on your lap watching the thing
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.080]   Yeah, that is a good way to work. I like that
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.080]   linda.com
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   We should start a thing. How do you watch linda?com?

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.760]   Do you know linda women? I did I never met her. She's great
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:07.280]   She wrote in the we used to have her on the screensavers all the time because she got started in this writing books on web design
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.800]   She was an expert in web design wrote these you know those remember the days where the books were that thick were like three
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.680]   For inches thick. She'd read those big thick books on web design. I always I always set the world at her
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.760]   Yeah, she's another. I think she's retired or she's she's she's the Larry page. Yeah, Larry paging learning
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:30.560]   So they she sold to a LinkedIn not so long ago and I think is enjoying the good life good for you
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.040]   There was just a great feature about 12 men who were lucky to be married to powerful
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.600]   Companies in Silicon Valley. I should be in that and I should be in there for sure. Well, yes
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.040]   But linda and her husband were one of the 12. Yeah
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.480]   Um his last name is dot com I think
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   Oh
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.600]   Very well nice. Very nice
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   Um
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.120]   So yeah, if you're choosing a phone this is an interesting time a year, isn't it?
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.520]   Because efas coming up in september we know the apple iphone will be now september ninth
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.480]   I think the apple iphone is going to be such an incremental upgrade this year. Yeah, yeah
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.120]   That I don't know if that's going to be something that's going to stimulate
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.240]   And we all paid so much for the first one
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.880]   Right, it's got to be just amazing to to justify an upgrade force touch better camera better processor
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.000]   That's it force touches of difficult thing to get excited about
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.320]   So I ordered the uh one plus two which has some not it's not it's got some
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.880]   question marks too
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.960]   Uh, but it is type c which I kind of like yeah, um the camera is becoming more and more important to me. Yeah
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.480]   Um, and the two new nexus is next I
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.800]   Will be interested because they're probably will have figure print. They probably will have
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.720]   I feel like yeah
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.520]   The one plus and the motos of a chewed
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.360]   fingerprint readers where no no the one plus does have a very good fingerprint
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.920]   I take it back the one plus two has supposedly the best of the bunch. Yeah, the fastest
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.960]   fingerprint reader of them all. Yeah, I feel like I
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.760]   I could live with that NFC, but I got to have fingerprint
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.280]   Just because of the convenience you got with their track record
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.040]   You you have to wonder whether people are going to trust them with the fingerprint data
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.320]   Of course a lot of the android based including samsung's fingerprint
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.640]   Really has been a hackable etc
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.360]   And so that's something uh, I'm not sure that they've demonstrated that they're a reliable company
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:27.680]   They certainly make high quality low-cost phones, but they they've had some questionable judgment there was a presentation of black hat
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:34.560]   Uh researchers showing how hackers can attack your smartphone and steal your fingerprint on a large scale. That's not onesie-tooe-ze
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.480]   um
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:44.240]   fire eye demonstrated ways to extract fingerprints from the sensors and samsung wallway and htc devices
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.960]   Um one in particular there were four attacks dubbed the fingerprint sensors spying attack
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:57.680]   Can harvest fingerprints on a large scale. Here's what's here's what's really really scary about that
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.480]   Your fingerprint is permanent. It's not like a password that they're stealing like it's more like you're social
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.280]   Right, I mean, you can't even change your social, but you can't change your exactly this goes on the market and becomes out there
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.440]   You know, somebody do with my fingerprint unlock my phone in the 10 years from now
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.240]   Who knows?
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.720]   Somebody showed no there was a demo of that of taking your fingerprint putting it on tape and you know, I saw that at the time
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.960]   We came out with apple. Yeah, what he managed to do it
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.560]   Yeah, but jeez, you know again the sky could fall down tomorrow
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.360]   apple stores your fingerprint in a
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.400]   In a first of all, they don't store the fingerprint they store
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.000]   Right data points about your fingerprint a hash and then second
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.600]   They also store in a secure store, which apparently Samsung doesn't do. Yeah
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.440]   Um, I don't know we'll have to find out what one plus does yeah, we'll see
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.920]   I mean that this is the those are two
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:47.600]   Facts that we got away for one is what are that pictures actually look like they can talk all day about the camera
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.960]   No, I'm gonna see the pictures and then the second thing is whoa, you know
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.880]   Let let's get the big security companies and hackers banging on their fingerprint reader and see what i'm Thursday
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   We're gonna do the samsung unveiled event. That's gonna be presumably
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:07.760]   We're not sure just the rumor mill has been very active the the new uh galaxy s6 edge plus
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.600]   Which is an oversized version of the s6 edge, which I like a lot. There's a great camera
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.760]   Good looking phone. I don't know if I want a bigger screen one of the things that's intriguing to me
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.800]   This uh
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.400]   This g is a five inch screen and I kind of like it a little bit better
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.840]   I wish we were a little higher res screen, but yeah the battery life. I think
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.120]   Benefits from a low res screen. Yeah, um, the mo-do x is going to be the new mo-do x pure is going to be
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360]   5.7 inches
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.880]   They're all samsung will also announce its note five is that going to be six inches or they're going to stay with the five points
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.200]   whatever it is
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.800]   giant
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.480]   Giant phones are the uh, or the wave of the future apparently
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:52.560]   So let's talk about messaging because I think this is a really interesting uh area. There was a good article in wired
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:59.120]   Uh, was it david pierce? I think who wrote the article in which he said can we just all agree on one messaging program?
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.640]   Yeah, like they do in china like in china where they get great
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:07.920]   Benefits of this of scale for a we chat you can buy not only can you chat?
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.560]   You can buy train tickets get your laundry done. You can do all sorts of stuff. Mm-hmm gaming
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.400]   um
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.480]   Facebook messengers the closest to becoming that in the us. I think right
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:26.480]   Mm. I don't know maybe facebook they've already got they've already got payments. Yeah
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.280]   Everybody's on facebook almost everybody but do people use the payments?
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:38.160]   No, I've never seen anybody use it. They say they've got a new a new feature called money penny that will be a digital assistant
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:45.280]   Yeah, now that third party versions of that exist right you can say please get my laundry and money penny will be human assistance
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:51.360]   Right. Yeah that you use facebook messenger. Yes to conjure up. Yeah. Well, that's the only way to do it
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.080]   You can't really bring my dry cleaning in is if you're a robot
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.240]   I don't think they'll take your dry cleaning in I think I think they're gonna function like serie
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.440]   They'll go out in a way. I'll ask them more questions. Right. They will be like the amazon mechanical Turk kind of exactly. I think that's
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.000]   Interesting your dry cleaning is gonna have to wait for another technology
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:15.120]   There are even according to Pearson this article there are even we chat stars much like they're vine stars
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.080]   People who use we chat as a broadcast medium
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.880]   I find kind of we gotta get in front of that. Yeah, I think this point is point as we can reach out
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.280]   Every you've got all these apps that focus on sort of one thing so you've got
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.920]   kick does something you know, what's app is for certain users and
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.880]   Facebook messenger is popular with some and then other people use this one or that one
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.840]   I'm trying to keep in touch with just a handful of friends let alone my kids
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:48.880]   There's like five different apps that I have to use and I can't I'm not sure which one to use
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.760]   Is the wrong one the person never sees it because they're not
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:58.640]   I'm we're kind of like the days where you couldn't text message somebody who wasn't on your carrier or if your friends used
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.200]   Cue then you had to use I said msn there and can't well
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.320]   Cue was so great because it well really
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:12.960]   Some we had trillion did that yeah, yeah, um and adi and pigeon there were a few of these
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.440]   Yeah, um in Canada everybody used msn messenger
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.320]   And here in the states, I think aim was the big one right what happened with msn messenger went away
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.160]   Did they did people stop what do they people just stop communicating? They just stop talking to each other
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.280]   They went to their cabins. That's right. No, I can use
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.640]   Blackberry
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.560]   Moose calls here here in the states bm like very bbm bbm
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.480]   But here in the states what happened is everybody just started using texts messaging sms
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.640]   You remember how we were how very late we were to that. That's right. We didn't close this
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.400]   I would say bbm came the closest in the last like recently to sort of owning
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.680]   Messaging and and I think it there were a couple things so they I remember when my daughter said she wanted a blackberry
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.240]   And I said, what are you talking about nobody wants a blackberry?
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.280]   Government what are you the president?
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.480]   Yeah, everyone wants iPhones and stuff like that and she said no no no
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   A I like the physical keyboard for bbm
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.520]   But I have to have bbm because all my friends use it and the main reason she told me they wanted it was read receipts
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.600]   So bm was one of the first ones to have read receipts
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.240]   in a sort of mainstream app and she said if you text somebody
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:37.520]   You know, I did a pregnancy test last night and it's positive or whatever something related to your romantic encounter
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.320]   You want to know that they saw that thing right away and you want to know when they sort of saw it and when they replied
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.800]   so read receipts was a huge deal and
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:54.880]   For a variety of reasons that we can't go into because that's a whole program blackberry basically screwed the pooch and bbm became
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:01.760]   You know didn't become what it could have become yeah, but it was close very close. Well speaking of close. I feel like google had
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.960]   Or has an opportunity with hangouts, but doesn't seem to get he just can't get it
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.640]   It's just not working. Yeah, I think they're trying to do too much
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.520]   You know messaging if you think about the apps that really
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:20.320]   Have worked whether it's kick or line or we chat or or even snapchat when it first started
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.920]   They are so simple like snapchat has now started adding a whole bunch of stuff and it's trying to become
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.960]   So it started with a simple that's a mistake and it's trying to become a much bigger full featured thing
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.240]   I don't know if that's gonna work, but but so they started with something
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.680]   Kids found a symbol I could it took me half an hour to even figure out how to do it. I agree with you
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.080]   You know, so but I had this conversation with my 21 year old yesterday at breakfast. I said what apps do you use?
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.200]   I always ask the kids and he said the holy trinity
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.480]   Facebook instagram snapchat
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.080]   And I said but I find snapchat a little opaque. He said, I don't know you just do this. I open it up
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.560]   I said well, he said I said I can't he said well swipe right. Oh swipe left. Oh, yeah
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.680]   It's and I said how did you understand how to use that?
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:12.640]   Uh did some somebody must have shown them right but because there's no it's not intuitive. Those are anti-dad features
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.600]   Well, he loves it
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.640]   Came from tender. I don't know that no well tender does that but I think snapchat pre
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.520]   Predated them, but then he does not do the snapchat if you swipe right. He says, oh no swipe right. That's just crap
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:35.280]   That's people who are doing this is the new stuff snap the stories and then the official stories
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.840]   He says no, no, you always swipe left never swipe right. Yeah
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.400]   And so snap you're you making an excellent point Matthew
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.160]   Which is snapchat is trying to become main more mainstream when they're really
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.840]   It's the kids like it because it's very simple you swipe left
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.840]   You you know, you make a joke you do something. I said you type say sometimes because they make it really easy
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.680]   But mostly it's just that and then you and then you want to see what you got you swipe you swipe left and that's where all your stuff
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.040]   You know, it's interesting the reason why I think snapchat's valuation is a 20 billion or whatever is
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.680]   Some of what they've been doing has been working
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.240]   So the weather right discover is working or whether it's sort of becoming a more full-featured
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.200]   Media app is working. I don't know but snapchat stories
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.560]   My teenage daughter started talking about oh, I'm I'm making this snapchat story
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:29.040]   So she is using like interesting you're talking about I don't even know what it is. Right. She is creating stories
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:36.160]   Which then people look at multiple photos video clips and I think it was earlier this year
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.360]   um
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.480]   One of our
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:46.400]   Writers looked at the kind of traffic those things get some individual snapchat stories. We're getting 20 million views
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.680]   I think was during a blizzard in in the winter
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:56.240]   Well, you know, I think I think about like some of these make sense. I mentioned this before but ESPN would just be sports highlights, right?
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.440]   That makes sense
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.200]   So this is so when you launch snapchat it launches like this that you're in the camera
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.600]   And I can immediately send a message is very straightforward if I swipe this way
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:11.680]   He says swipe swipe swipe to the right. Oh, that's people sending you snapchat's. I said what yeah people have been sending you messages
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.520]   Oh, I don't have anything. Oh, and then you swipe this way. These are the stories
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.760]   And yeah, and then like I have this this person
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   The other thing I thought I had to hold it down. You just tap it. Yeah, that's one of the so they made it so you don't have to hold it down
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.760]   They changed that so um
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.720]   And then here's snap at tunde bear tunde does the stories. He doesn't fun stuff
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   Um, but my problem with this is it's gone after a day. So like why I spent a lot of energy making stuff. Okay, I upload forever
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.240]   And then these are the big brands and so you're saying 20 million views in a day
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:52.880]   In yeah of a single snapchat story. It's amazing
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:59.680]   This was somebody taking video of a blizzard or something during the during the New York away. I'm in a yahoo's gone. Yahoo
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:07.040]   Oh, kitty kirk stopped doing her news, huh? They were there for 24 hours and they vanished foot buzzfeed in I think
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:12.960]   Interesting, but what's interesting to me is there they clearly started with it's a little like twitter
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.040]   They started with something incredibly simple and they're trying to add more features
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:23.600]   So the question becomes can they do that or will their sort of core users think i'm not going to use that snapchat thing anymore
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.120]   There's too many features or there's too much crafter. There's too much, you know, it doesn't do what I want it to do anymore
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.360]   It's interesting to watch messaging
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.520]   Messaging you can see sort of
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:41.920]   emergent behavior like I always like you I asked my daughters what they're using my my
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.360]   Middle daughter uses aim and I said what you does that even exist anymore?
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.440]   And she says oh, yeah, oh my friends and I ought to use it and I was like, why why on earth would you do that?
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   Haven't you tried prodigy?
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.960]   What's that? Why don't you use that? Oh, well, what's some some my friends don't want to pay
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:04.800]   I said, but you don't have to pay do you? Will you have to pay a dollar a year you pay and then
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.920]   After and so this is actually I wouldn't have thought that would stop anyone
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.760]   But aim is the only is the closest thing they found to a cross platform app. They all have it
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.720]   It's it's super cheap. You know, it doesn't cost anything. You can install it on everything
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.920]   The only problem is I think there's no she was telling me there's no
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:29.840]   Why don't they use facebook or feels like facebook would be the right? They don't want to use facebook
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.240]   Why not they've got stickers. They've got she doesn't want to be on facebook
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:43.040]   Youngest oh that's interesting. He did her facebook account. She doesn't have one people our age are looking for messaging services where we can message
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:49.200]   Everybody and people your daughter's age are looking for the opposite for places where they can't be reached by
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.720]   Most people other than their tiny group or they can have select groups that they message about specific things
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.920]   So maybe this this point that we should have a universal
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.240]   I brought this up on twit and the people everybody said the same thing. No, no, we don't want that
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.760]   Yeah, you don't want that you want your own little niche, but aren't most of these universal through sms
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:13.760]   Snapchat supports it hang out supports it. Yep. I mean you can just you could just you know if somebody isn't on the the messaging
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:20.000]   Right, but let's go back to the problem of email right because email is universal because it is center controlled
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.840]   That's what ruins email
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.680]   So this this is a form of recipient control is that I go where I know I am my friends are nobody else can find me there
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.000]   And I don't get spam there
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.880]   Actually speaking of messaging Twitter just changed the length of
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:41.840]   Dms now you can send limitless dm. There's no 140 character length. Yeah, so now dms can become effectively service in base email
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.200]   Yeah, so here's what we discussed last week. This is really interesting
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.920]   So facebook is introducing this direct message to companies thing
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.280]   Right and to me
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.520]   This is the guy who did del hell is interesting
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:01.440]   What the way that customer service now works through facebook and companies being able to direct message you back and actually deal with things
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.760]   Is there afraid of public humiliation?
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.680]   Right. Yeah
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:12.880]   Michael larrynton says my cable's not working and they jump on it and and frank who went from Comcast and just announced he's quitting in city
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.480]   We don't know what's next for him
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.840]   Basically created that structure of being able to deal with that right
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.240]   Now facebook turns around and says no no no you can you can directly message a company through facebook
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.120]   And we will rate them on whether or not they respond within
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.480]   Seconds
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:35.520]   Right and so what's facebook? I think really sells then is the opportunity to avoid public humiliation if you behave well
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:41.120]   Right, uh, which I find just fascinating and I don't know if it's gonna work. It's just everywhere
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.240]   Coppies not on
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.920]   The three public humiliation on on twitter is what gets resolved
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:54.160]   Right public. Yeah, if you say hey, or can it screwing me or can is like holy? We better respond
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.280]   But this is but this is the genius of facebook's this is the genius of facebook's plan you get results with their
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.080]   System too because they have a they have a metric for earning a badge that says highly responsive company avoid humiliation
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:12.400]   Exactly the company certainly don't want to be forced to give results. There's less direct humiliation, right? Yeah
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.800]   Yes, and actually I've noticed that on twitter for a long time companies responded now what they do is call you and say can you stop tweeting?
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.640]   Yeah, they don't they I've had this with Comcast at first it worked
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.440]   Now they just have somebody from the executive office call and say would you mind not tweeting?
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.360]   And then of course you tweet hey, they just called me and said don't immediately what I tweeted that always started
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:40.880]   Yeah, so so facebook's do its interesting things around this. They're also our our our unconfirmed reports that they're starting a news
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:47.200]   Application yeah the law have you guys been watching rich richy surveys on facebook? No, I can't bear it
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.360]   And you know why i'll tell you I can't bear it. He's making a mistake. He's too close to his face, which is ugly
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.280]   See this is the tv pure ever bill you're rarely
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.640]   Just an irritating person
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.960]   I know but it's irritating
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.600]   He's vlogging on facebook, right? This is important. This is important. We're your base
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.480]   Set the tone of podcast like crazy for media companies not for you guys but for media companies
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.640]   But he did the original podcast where a media company
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.880]   No, no old media companies. Oh, okay at the guardian watch this
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.440]   It's original thing. Do you think this is something you want to have in your life in your feed?
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.280]   I don't want to have a close-up of his bad teeth in my feed. I'm sorry
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.840]   I love Ricky's your vase. I love the office. He's experimenting
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.600]   Okay, it's hilarious. It's hilarious. It's hilarious. Not bad. No, they're not that bad
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.440]   They're pretty good. He's no it scares me because he's got sharpened like cuspids
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.480]   He does have he does a little scary. It's like if he might you know if he had an appealing personality
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:49.200]   I don't think this would be so bad, but he's just he's just irritating
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.520]   This works if you're a beautiful woman. I'm afraid it does not work if you're a gentleman of certain
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:59.360]   Debulities if you ever thought that Ricky's your vase and Nick Denton are separated at birth. Oh god
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.400]   No now that you've said it though
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.560]   But what he is doing is Facebook native, which is interesting
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.640]   He's not getting the engagement that you would one would hope like this
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:17.120]   Is a discovery issue. I never have seen him live. Yeah. Oh, this is live
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.640]   Well, that's but that is recorded. Yes, but this is this is experimenting with facebook live. How would you see it live?
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:28.960]   You'd get a little bit of show up in your stream. Oh, Ricky's live. But do I have to like him first? Yes
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.640]   Yes, all right. I'm gonna like him and then we'll know when he's live
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.680]   But I still haven't seen another sign up mean
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.320]   That's weird. You click on that and it goes off to a separate thing sign up
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.360]   I know I've never seen that link in the other celebrity and it's totally this youtube. How did he get that link in there?
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.360]   Oh, man. They're giving special treatment. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.840]   This is youtube. This must be an ad. This is part of it a new trend
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.000]   Where where facebook apple and twitter are creating elitist?
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   Mechanisms and separate in there. They're destroying the the egalitarianism of the social web
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.080]   They got special to is this social network that you can't fully use
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.640]   They were experimenting at this level with a small population that's going to push it
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.400]   And then you know because there have been others who've been going after them saying what do I get it?
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.480]   What do I get it? They said we're just starting we're just starting
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.760]   I have to judge them on what they're doing rather than what they're saying and what they're doing right now is they have
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.480]   Just like apple has connect just like twitter has special features for verified users
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.080]   they're they're they're creating different tools different powers different resources for
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.840]   famous people for powerful people for leads, okay, and the rest of us sign up takes me to
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.560]   A youtube page where I'd subscribe to more about this Netflix originally he's doing
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.760]   So look at that now. I notice on his facebook page
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.160]   There's also a videos link
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.720]   And it if I click it it takes me to this is that a youtube page or a facebook page?
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.120]   That's a facebook page. It is a facebook page. It looks like a youtube page
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.400]   Oh man does that look like a youtube page
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.960]   So go back to that other link that really was youtube that really was youtube. Yeah
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.760]   unclear
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.400]   Gina tripple me. Why would facebook have a sign up?
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.400]   I should tell you
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:22.480]   Um, I bet you I'm thinking netflix paid for that that that's an ad netflix ad
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.160]   That that sign up button right there. That's an ad is an ad
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.600]   No, no, no, we we have that too like if you go to if you go to tech news today tv
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.920]   Okay, facebook facebook.com slash tech news today tv go away
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.080]   I don't know when they rolled this out, but they said you can put a button on your on your page
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.640]   And it goes to youtube
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.080]   There goes wherever you want tech. Oh, it goes where it goes. What is it tech news?
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.040]   Today tv tv
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.000]   And so
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   I got the wrong spell
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.320]   Yeah, I know this by the way
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.320]   It's kind of like what you can put on the video itself, which is a different feature
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.680]   And so I don't see a subscribe button here
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   Wait a minute. No, that's the wrong. I'm on the wrong
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.680]   How do I get there tech news today tv?
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:15.200]   Did I type it wrong? Oh, you know what I have to do facebook.com. Yeah slash right?
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.000]   Okay, I was doing this in the search and this this actually for pages
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.520]   This is and for media pages. This is one of the rings. That's really great about but you don't have a subscribe right there
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.440]   Oh, you do sign up and you click on it now. What do I get?
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.280]   What the heck how did that happen?
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.040]   It's a paid ad. I've been I stole your credit card and I've been paying for this
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.600]   Okay, so this is a feature
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.800]   Have you guys tried the new facebook author tag very very familiar from the old google author?
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.960]   Yeah, no, I haven't what I haven't heard about it. So the facebook author tag
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.240]   It's like like the old google author tag. It's a line it, which is now dead
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.480]   It's a line of javascript you put in there and i'm not you gotta explain it where
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.960]   Put in where your blower where so put it on a buzz machine. Oh, okay in your blog
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.800]   Okay, and then when someone goes to from a facebook link to a buzz machine thing and they come back to facebook
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.560]   They'll see a byline for me because it shows that they engage with me. I cannot explain it. Well, that's what I heard today
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:17.760]   Have you ever seen this happen? No, I haven't yet because it's pretty new in action. Okay. No
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.720]   But it's something we've probably shown a bunch of time
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:27.360]   We spent a bunch of time integrating with google's author tag and then they're like, oh, yeah, we're not doing that anymore. So thanks
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.920]   so
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.440]   So
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.640]   Okay, what are we talking about? I just feel like facebook is is really there
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.560]   In everything in fact, I still think facebook messenger will become
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.280]   uh dominant and actually
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.560]   This isn't messaging related but facebook and youtube
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.880]   Are going head to head on video and yes going to oh, yeah massive
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.640]   like, you know
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.760]   Thor and and like a whole kind of
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.160]   Norse mythology thing because their facebook is clearly targeting
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.040]   YouTube in every way possible
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.960]   We talked last week ad infinitum about the article on medium. I'm fed up with your lies and cheating facebook
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.000]   No, that actually is a facebook page
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.520]   Uh, who was that it was a facebook it was a youtube creator
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:27.520]   Yeah, a hank greenium. Yeah, um, I wonder if in the intervening week facebook has approached hank green and said
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.480]   What can we do to make this right? They certainly had a response?
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:37.360]   Like half an hour after that but we're published. I'm sure each day they're going after your facebook youtube creators aren't they?
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:43.360]   Definitely they have to be and they are going to ramp up the monetization, which is what's been missing
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.920]   Like youtube here's here's the question back to the beginning
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.080]   Matthew
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:54.240]   Should mark zuckerberg reorganize facebook the way that google has because facebook now seems to be controlling brand but what's that?
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.240]   Is gigantic instagram is gigantic?
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.160]   Um
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:01.200]   Funny goggles will be made fun of on time magazine, but we become big
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.800]   Um
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.360]   You know as facebook in a similar position is not a burger in a similar position to where i already was in a way
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.480]   In a way they are erin grip is wrote for us a piece very much like that facebook should do the same thing
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.120]   It has become a kind of holding company in a way
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.440]   What's happened instagram are both huge entities by completely autonomous
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.200]   What should it mean?
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.880]   It's arguably like self-driving cars. It should be whatever the trainees equivalent of alphabet is
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.440]   Right that piece strobe
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.720]   Yeah
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:40.160]   Post there's a there's a argument that because uh larry said that alphabets are a key
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.080]   invention of technology that enables everything else that that was racist politically incorrect the chinese
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.280]   Come on. Come on. That's just dumb
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.040]   It is it is washington post went on length
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.880]   Actually, so it should be should be called congee that even the chinese
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.440]   I think are realizing that uh ideograph based language is a liability in the town knowledge
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.400]   And that's why everybody in china is learning english
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.520]   um
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:15.280]   Wow, that was a good conversation. I never know where they're going to come from do you?
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.280]   Yeah
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:23.920]   Have we come with a conclusion though? Do we have any recommendations? Well, I I would like to tack one last thought on the end of that
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.920]   Which is this is your specialty. Yeah
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:32.480]   Yes facebook is going after youtube but but but but facebook is in the same bad position
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.880]   with video that google is with messaging and social in that
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.640]   First mover advantage the youtube has so many advantages that have the stars they have the studios
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.640]   They have the kids they have all that stuff
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.040]   And facebook can can bang away at it all they want but they're they're
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:52.800]   Barely scratching the surface of genuinely competing with youtube
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.720]   And I don't see any reason why they're they're a threat in any way
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.760]   They have a billion users. They have a billion
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.280]   Active users google google has google has
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.920]   Google has more eyeballs than facebook with search and android and all the rest
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.480]   And and and I don't think that
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.520]   That helps them dominating the one thing that facebook has that really helps them with video
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.920]   Is control of their algorithm so they if they want people watching more videos
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.960]   They just throw a switch in the algorithms and people are going to be watching more videos
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.040]   They've already done it with self playing videos
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.960]   And that's a huge too
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:30.640]   Well, I mean they're gonna they can drive volume to a video unlike
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.080]   Anything i'm gonna do facebook live video as soon as they throw the switch but but when i'm awesome
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.720]   But what's by the way is coming right? Yeah
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.160]   I'm verify you know what I did recently that was stupid
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.720]   I took my verify profile and made it private
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.560]   But i'm gonna fly because I just wanted to do that because I wanted to facebook to be just for me
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.520]   Oh, you fooling and my oh you fool. I can go the other way have you tried snapchat
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.400]   I'm no real report but i've actually been thinking about the same thing should I have a page
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.760]   Or should it just be for family vote? I have a lail report page, you know a public page
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.280]   I have three times more followers on facebook than i do on twitter
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   No, I don't know
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.240]   You know what the algorithm serves to them anymore than i did on google plus
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:20.800]   But I have been lawfully neglecting my facebook presence. I have been i've not because of scoble
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.440]   I have been digging into facebook and really
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.360]   You know
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.160]   Call me in it making it work and it's it's a very good experience
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.880]   So here's the call to action button you found it. Yeah, I just went to my my long neglected lail
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.360]   report page journalist
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.240]   Call to action don't look at the ad a button to get people to take an action from your page
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:48.720]   It isn't just uh, it's book now contact us use app play game shop now sign up or watch video

[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.800]   Or no, you don't and then on mobile you can have a different one
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.120]   In fact, you can even have a different one on iphone and android wow
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:04.800]   That is amazing. Do you get to it? How do you get to it? It's on your page. It's right there
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:09.280]   It has to be for a page not for a private. Yeah, create call to action. Oh, but my page is not verified
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.040]   So how do I get that verified so I can stream live? I don't think your page is very but I think you are
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.160]   I'm personally very I think if you allow people to follow you
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:19.200]   Then I can not do live video
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.240]   But not no, no, but I think that's that's what that's what
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:28.720]   Um, yeah, but no, I'm verified as but I made that but if you're a verified or five age
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.760]   It has a work you gotta be verified in public before you can do public things
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.240]   Yeah, but I can make this public. Yeah, make it public
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:41.120]   But when I question is follow I would like to have my leo loport person public page be the verified. Yeah, it's not
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.840]   So I don't know how to do that. Not to look at it. I'm not sure. I don't think you can you can't
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.360]   It's like twitter. You just have to hope that the verified no no
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:52.720]   I don't I don't think pages are verifiable at all
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.640]   Oh, so this is facebook's way of forcing me. Yes. Yeah to be public
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:04.960]   Yes. Oh wow. It's a good thing leo. Let me see if there's any new photos and if there are i'll make myself public
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.520]   Sharing is good leo sharing with the world is good sharing is caring
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:15.920]   Um, and is the 45 minute limit still in place for live? Yes, it uh for for uploaded but for live
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000]   I don't know about we could I just drop three days his hat as it keeps cutting off on them?
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.240]   Yeah, so my my joke today to get this man that connection or a job because he's sitting there all day on the stairs with the cat
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:32.080]   Well, this is why uh movie stars are perfectly suited for this because it's not apparent
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.000]   But they only work a few months a year nothing to do right? They got nothing to do
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.200]   90% of the time. They're just home waiting for a script
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.960]   Yeah, they could shoot video all day long. Nobody would
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.080]   I'm just just just play a ricky jovese video per second. Let's do it. All right. All right
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.320]   All right, he did the first one he did was in the bathtub. Oh my gosh like robert scoble
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:58.560]   No, that was a show. That was a show. All right. Okay, and by the way ricky jovese uses his personal page
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:05.120]   Uh for this notice he's verified. That's exactly. Yeah, so which one should I which one should let's go to
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.280]   Let's go to should we do the first one in the bathtub? I see one from

[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.600]   Let's not a busy man. Let's watch this everybody

[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.120]   Close up

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.000]   He did say thanks. That's not the combo

[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.680]   I've already sort of built a little studio. Well, actually what it is is i've just popped my thing on a
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.280]   Smell paint
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.000]   I don't know what's it called
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.560]   Having it. This is great riveting content. I love it. I love it. It tries me crazy
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.240]   I feel I could get one of those wherever I am
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:35.920]   That's like bad. I mean, it's just like bad. I mean, it's just like what was his name the comic who did the stupid stuff. Um, six
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.160]   See, uh, I've never been
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.560]   Go on the chat show. Yeah to
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:47.840]   See what he's said. I actually haven't done like a press interview for years. He's undercutting the whole genre. Yeah
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.120]   Yeah, exactly. I don't have to do press interviews
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.520]   But let's so this is like permanent periscoping
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:59.280]   This is periscope that you you as a as a member of the of the riffraff are not allowed to use
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.560]   That's what we're here to keep here's the opposite here's the opposite mic
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.040]   Periscope you go into periscope and it is nothing
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.680]   It is it is unmanageable mountain of video crap
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.800]   Whereas here by starting with celebrity. It's kind of brilliant. Oh no, they're starting this part live stuff here is gonna be
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.080]   Interesting to watch number one number two. There's a problem of so this so so you're you're a verified person
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.640]   So we know who this is. It's not just somebody who's gonna show you his penis
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:26.960]   Number two. That's a good point. That's a good point. That's exactly what is there. I don't know how that problem as long as they keep it
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.440]   Tently concerned. How are you starting? It's not gonna be invited to this although it's Ricky's your bet. You don't know for sure
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.680]   right you never know
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:38.560]   But my point is it's it's it's television minus all the good things about television
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.640]   It's television in the sense that it's script
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:45.200]   People like sending it to you and you're supposed to sit there and watch and oh buy something by the way
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:51.440]   And you don't participate. It's not participative media. This is what they're killing with this kind of thing people said the messages
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:57.520]   It was either let's see it send fan mail to to go Gilligan twain johnson the rock
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.760]   Is also one of the people involved in this he actually does a pretty compelling
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.880]   Instagram video. Well, he's the rock. He's the rock and he's apparently at the gym
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:16.160]   Of course clanging and banging it's in the iron paradise. You see the rock. Yeah for all his flaws
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.280]   This isn't this is more interesting. They were keyed your face
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:25.600]   Up close that's operational right people like the rock maybe they want to be who else the giant let's see women
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.720]   There's others on this nobody wants to be Ricky. Just Serena Williams martha stewart and michael boob lei
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:35.440]   It's an interesting mix. Here's serena williams lying in bed
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:44.240]   She's so rich. She has people as her bed. Oh, no, there's no we got Ricky in the background. I turned off Ricky
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:46.880]   For a few seconds before it goes away
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.960]   So I better fast i'm gonna pass this is really bad
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:54.800]   I'm gonna get a photo shoot today and i'm gonna go out and go photo shoot in it
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.880]   And then i'm gonna go practice and i didn't make my practice day
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.920]   But after that i'm gonna go by the way
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.000]   This is what intimidates me about using this stuff is I would actually try to make it polished interesting
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000]   Exactly what she's not supposed to be informal
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.520]   To go over the three weeks of my own
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   These guys aren't even as good as the most mediocre vine celebrity
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.480]   You'll see what martha stewart's up to
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.120]   I think it's interesting. Oh my god. It's terrifying
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:26.800]   First line broadcast with facebook. She's trying to be professional. Yeah, big mistake, right? This is not the medium
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:29.040]   So
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:35.120]   I was thrilled frankly serena was the most interesting. Yeah, and uh, I appreciate the work that
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:35.920]   i think facebook
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:37.120]   One in rene
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.080]   Next
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.080]   What is she where she in the prison cafeteria?
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.440]   So
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.440]   That really i'm here in my
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.080]   Facebook facebook has one big
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.960]   My first live chat with this new facebook. Nope by the way
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.600]   Ricky's the only one i was there more than one
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.960]   Thanks. Like you know what she got
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.920]   She got to do hers, uh, like
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:03.840]   This is a lot like near cat periscope. This is exactly the experience you have
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:09.600]   See remember the discussion last week. This is the kitchen photo in a people magazine store. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:15.040]   This is i'm actually with them you get to watch the professionals be unprofessional. That's what the
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:19.200]   Sale sale sale point is i get to see their hallway and they're cat. Yeah
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:22.000]   Well, i'm gonna go back to page public and do this
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.880]   Well, they can
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.560]   Maybe i'm gonna start what would your counsel were you invited were you invited into uh, is it mentions? It's called
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.480]   Matt what's mentions that's the celebrity thing that's a celebrity celebrity
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.240]   Celebrity video streaming thing you have to be invited as well as before video mentions was there
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.800]   So you can share things all kinds of ways mentions is the base
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:47.680]   A video. It's a mess. So you was added to mention you have to be uh in mentions first like private twitter. Yeah
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.480]   Well, it meant that well your public
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:59.120]   But it's only four stars mentions was a way that stars could more easily communicate with their publics using facebook and going across platforms
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.600]   I think this is right tell me if i'm wrong jerry
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.280]   Uh, and then video was just add live video was just add exactly into feature of mentions. Yes. Yeah, okay
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.040]   Well, i'm resetting myself. I can't believe you didn't get invited
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.520]   He doesn't even have a public problem. I that's probably what i'm making in public right now
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.640]   Why were they invited me's process? It's plus a lot of respect for you already
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:21.520]   I know and I feel bad
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.560]   Um, where do I make it public under privacy who can see my stuff public? Is that all I have to do
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:32.160]   There's something to be people being able to follow you. Yeah, I used to do that. I turned that off about a month ago
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.800]   bad time on Leo
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.560]   Because I thought as Leo does that because I thought it'd be fun to be private
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:45.520]   I love that feature though because if people asked to friend me and I just ignore them. They automatically become followers. Yeah
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:48.320]   This is the this is when you got mad Leo
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:54.960]   No, I wasn't mad. No, I just I thought I'd like to experience facebook as a normal person
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.840]   Like following friends and family
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.480]   Yeah, do that
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.920]   I'm not a normal person. You have to be a normal person in order to do that. All right. All right
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.720]   All right, so
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:13.280]   Some other number i'm gonna turn this on and uh, well, I don't really have a private life. Do I really? I mean really
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.880]   So it was it was all an illusion. Anyway, not after that later hose and shot. Oh, man
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.960]   Yeah, well that actually is exactly when I turned off the public sharing
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.560]   I don't blame you it was a bridge too far
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.520]   um
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:35.280]   Okay, so what else the attention economy? I don't even want to hear that word anymore. That's you why?
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.760]   I was gonna say just before we get up facebook and youtube
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.120]   The one thing that facebook has that it can use as a lever and it's a pretty big lever
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.160]   Is the control over the algorithm? So yeah, we were talking about they can make certain videos show up
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:54.800]   All the time they can make sure that people see them. That's a huge bargaining chip
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:01.200]   If someone, you know wants their content to be seen facebook and star asturren said i'm going to take my show off serious
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.160]   And i i'm gonna go to youtube or i'm gonna go to facebook
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.800]   He said that
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.120]   No, oh, but i don't sure if he said that when I called it
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:15.200]   Was the last time I yelled at him again when he went on his podcast ray, you know rant
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.360]   I said you should be owning your own venture. I say this to him every time i call in
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.480]   Sure, he's a wage slave. It's so obvious that that should be that's the case that he should do that
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:29.200]   His weight just massive and the and the problem is that he says that oh, you know that that doesn't you know
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.120]   That doesn't work for all these people, but he's howard starne he should have done it three years ago
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.600]   Well, here's the issue
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.560]   Yeah, I argued five years ago when his contract was up and i've revealed on the show that I actually introduced his people to
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:46.480]   Executives at google and it went nowhere, but the problem was the last six inch problem wasn't solved
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:50.800]   Wait a minute when you say last six inch and howard starne the sentence is
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:56.720]   Maybe you better clarify the last six inch problem from your from your phone to your car. Oh, thank god
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:02.800]   By the way, is that still the aspirational google five case that you have on your phone?
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:08.240]   Yes, and I haven't you still haven't signed up, but you have the case i'm not by i have it
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.800]   But I haven't I haven't installed it. I haven't gotten even one second once you once they start charging you
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.960]   Oh, I see i'm not charged yet. I'll be charged as soon as I started
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:20.800]   I gotta figure out the phones and that's why I gotta figure out the one plus versus the
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:27.600]   uh, moto axe versus should I really instead buy an iPhone so I can test out things that are on the iphone which I hate having to do
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.840]   Get them all do what leo does buy them all
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.560]   Yeah, it's only you know really it's only a few thousand dollars a month
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:42.800]   You know what adds up having two numbers on each of the four carriers after a while that adds up
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:47.680]   Yo, well, yeah, is no phone is no good if you can't use it
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.480]   true
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.760]   Why do you have two numbers on the four carriers? Oh because I just
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:55.120]   I don't know
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.440]   Because what you have one that's actually your real phone you can really use for life and the other one is the one that can get messed up
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:04.160]   Now my phone situation is much like a facebook situation. I don't have a real life phone
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.120]   But don't you just use google voice actually like i do
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.600]   Google file screws your voice
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:18.160]   How does it grow because it take it suddenly you no longer have a your file your voice is converted to google phi
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:21.920]   Your phone your voice number becomes your actual phone number
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:27.040]   You're still gonna have forwarding so I have forwarding turned on although I haven't figured I have to add new numbers
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:33.600]   It's gonna be a challenge you need tech support. I wish there were someone I could ask
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.480]   If i'll help if only only
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.120]   Um, all right anything else we want to talk about before we get to our picks
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:49.440]   I'll let you look at the run down. Yeah. Well, we work. This is really what we are talking about isn't it the attention economy definitely
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.520]   That attention is more important than that
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:56.160]   Go ahead that david pacman piece that I linked to uh from ben rock
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:03.120]   One of the things he mentions which I didn't get into it so whole separate post but one of the things he mentions that I think is really true is that
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:10.000]   Messaging and sharing are the most central apps for particularly for millennial users
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:16.080]   So whether it's what's app or kick or line or instagram or those are the key
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:25.120]   Ways in which they experience the internet and content, which is why what snapchat is doing is is so important
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:33.120]   Or why that that's why I think snapchat is doing it it's trying to leverage the messaging and get into all sorts of other areas of media
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:37.760]   But it's it's a that's where attention is going. So basically what david did was
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.960]   Look at where is attention going not?
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:47.920]   What are the big companies or who's making lots of revenue or what market caps are but where is our attention going?
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:52.080]   And when it comes to millennial users, it's mobile and it's messaging
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:55.600]   And youtube and youtube come on a mill
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.760]   Well, okay, it was huge. No, you're right and youtube. So let's say let's say
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.400]   video streaming and message
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.760]   Yeah, but tv and radio
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.640]   Shrinking piece of the pie
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.120]   Actually, you want to you want to really look at a bad one news print newspapers and
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.720]   I think i can't even see that line in
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.440]   Go down further. There's a chart where he looks at the things that actually keep going
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:28.000]   Keep going. This is good. This is a good article people's he was at music, right?
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.400]   But now he's a pc audience size and media platforms and properties
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.560]   Look at the far left face the far left, which is like through the roof
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.360]   Facebook youtube yahoo
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.000]   Uh twitch riot games
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.120]   What exactly what's twitch riot games?
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.160]   It's all esports
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.640]   It's a studio. It's not even it's a subset of twitch
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.680]   Just games produced by that game studio. It's riot games is a game studio on twitch
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:57.840]   It's not even all of twitch
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.640]   Riot games is bigger than tumblr twitter snapchat the super bowl
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.800]   Look at the size that thing so that's his point is that some youtube creators some vine creators
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.320]   They have audiences that are substantially larger than the nba major league baseball
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.440]   Pewdiepie
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.640]   38 million
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:24.160]   Pewdiepie yeah four billion views you know they're conflating numbers here because youtube views are not the same thing
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.680]   Great. They're not the same as a tv viewer, but they that is still a
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.160]   8 look at that give course of the mouth though
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.840]   40 million subscribers
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.720]   Pewdiepie's audience
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:40.560]   Well, which would you rather have 18 million viewers on nbc or 18 million viewers on youtube nbc because they can sell ads for a lot
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:42.640]   Now they can sell ads, but let's see
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.280]   I don't even think 18 million viewers on youtube means the same thing as 18
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.080]   Yes, advertisers are wildly stupid their their ads aren't being watched
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.160]   They're gonna figure it out. Whereas whereas this is this is also a big thing that google did this week
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.920]   Google also cut off certain ways to buy on youtube
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.200]   You can only buy now through you through google
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:09.280]   And uh, they do the true view thing where your ad is actually really watched which tv can't give you and that's gonna end up being a very high
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:12.320]   Value every media company I know is dying for video
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.680]   So how much money was spent on a super bowl? It's got to be a billion dollar
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.680]   There's gonna be some huge amount of money, right?
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.800]   Super Bowl had 114 million viewers
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.920]   Riot games which is league of legends had
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.720]   739 million viewers
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:32.080]   Uh now admittedly super bowl is because three hours and riot games is probably a year's worth of viewing
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.200]   But still why isn't at least a large segment of that billion dollars going to riot games
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:42.560]   Well part of it, I think is the average person who watches the super bowl has a better job than the average person who uses
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:45.520]   What is the value of 144
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:48.480]   1004 million riot games viewers right or whatever 739
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:50.880]   So no, it's a point
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.240]   Part of david's point and part of my point is he's talking to our intern who watches riot games incessantly, yeah
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.440]   You look at the gap right that gap is going to close
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.760]   So attention is is going elsewhere and all i'm saying is
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.600]   Media companies in particular should be paying more attention to where that
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:11.600]   Attention is going because that's where the money is going to go eventually
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.480]   Yeah, whether it's e-sports or streaming and that's I mean facebook sees that otherwise
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.480]   Why would they be doing half of this stuff?
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.680]   They see periscope and vine as the the future of video to some extent
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:27.440]   Those are the things that are going to going to determine the platforms
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:33.440]   I guess i'm also but I am pointing out that this is quantitative and there is a qualitative measure that is maybe somewhat different
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:38.880]   Totally. Yeah, but the quality so I talked again to one of my daughters
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.000]   She watches twitch all the time. She's watching people play
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.080]   Minecraft for hours right like is that as good as a super bowl?
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:52.880]   I don't know but she's spending hours watching people play games right so all i'm saying is there is something there
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:55.600]   Right. Yep. There's something there
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:00.800]   Well, what you want what you want to look at is not what's going to replace television viewing
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:06.080]   You want to look at what behaviors are going to change and be exact cap capture those behaviors
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:12.480]   So what this really regardless of the quality of this audience what you're really seeing is that in a new generation
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:17.920]   There is a behavioral shift and that's something that everybody has to pay attention to
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:24.080]   Yeah, and I think part of what david is saying is it's messaging and sort of interaction and
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.560]   emotion-based
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.560]   consumption whether it's gaming or
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:36.160]   Streaming video is is what lots of younger viewers want the other thing to keep in mind. Well, they what will they grow out of that
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:40.820]   Well, that's the question. Will they suddenly decide? Oh, I think I should watch the super
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:47.760]   Really important question and it's the because that's the one the media pin their hopes on
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:51.840]   Oh, yeah, you'll start watching
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:56.640]   Opposites. Yeah, but you can use this line didn't use this line somebody use this line. I just read it today
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.320]   Where somebody said that you invest in the behavior of youth
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.800]   Right
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.440]   We're saying that youth are going to become like their parents. It's the opposite the parents are going to become like the children
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:14.080]   Right, and that's where the world is headed here. And so no, they're not going to grow up and start buying newspapers and buying time magazine
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:20.960]   That's yeah, three years is executive said oh when they get jobs and have kids they'll all start subscribing. Yep papers
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:26.000]   How many times did we hear that Matthew how many times to me the difference though is that is that
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.480]   Especially if you know, I think a good
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:37.120]   Example of this is the Super Bowl versus twitch. Okay, the biggest difference between how people used to watch media or how older people currently do and how
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:45.040]   Younger people do and how people will in the future watch is that a single show that everybody's watching the exact same thing will be replaced by
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:48.560]   Whether it's 10 media or a thousand
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.360]   People who everybody will watch in something different
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:56.720]   And that's the biggest change in in what's what's that's what's really changing is that
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:00.240]   The shared experience is gone with the exception of maybe beats one
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:02.800]   Blimebuster
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.440]   I actually just saw a news report on a an esports competition
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:12.800]   It was watched by millions of people and the winners won something like 18 million dollars
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.320]   You know, that's to to people who like esports and gaming that is the Super Bowl
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:22.400]   Yeah, you know, that is their shared experience. It was a huge arena full of people
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:26.080]   Yes
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:31.360]   But you know, I think you know if you look, you know when I would when I was you know 20 or whatever
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:36.080]   There was like three channels and cable was like something that some people had and and so on
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:42.560]   And nowadays even though there are occasional events and and you know, people will also watch the Oscars and the Super Bowl and and you know
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:46.160]   Various things even the republican debates lots of people are watching that as well
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:53.920]   But I think that the really interesting behavior is that the the number of individual things that the thing that's diverting eyeballs is everything
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:55.920]   It's not one thing that's replacing us
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:02.480]   And one of the problems is that it's a misnomer to say that on on your phone that all look all this is in the apps
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:07.600]   Because it's because when i'm gaming versus when i'm communicating versus when i'm getting information
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:11.200]   These are entirely different use cases that I happen to use the same device
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:15.600]   And the fact that it occurs in an app or not should not make media companies think we all need our app
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:18.480]   Right, well, you got a different case for somebody playing a game
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:24.240]   And in fact lots of facebook content comes through there in their built-in browser, which is the mobile web
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.720]   It's not true it comes through an app, but it's effectively the mobile app. Yep
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:32.720]   Oh, we just missed a live ricky jurevays
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.520]   Cat quick is see
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:38.320]   Build a time of tension. It's about attention
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:41.040]   We should be paying attention to reiki jurevays
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:48.960]   If I were a massive if I were coca-cola should I buy ads on the ricky jurevays live stream? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.600]   You can't by the way, can you?
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:53.840]   You can't
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.840]   Can I buy an ad on that?
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:01.200]   By the way, can I just point this out he posted this yesterday it has 1.4 million views
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.840]   57,000 likes for
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:07.360]   4,200 comments
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:12.320]   See, okay, this is a much bigger platform than youtube
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.120]   But there's got no ads on it
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:21.040]   Well, because that don't forget what i said last week it will mark doesn't bother with it until it's a billion user. Yeah, yeah
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.920]   Can I hold up a coca-cola can on my that he monetizes the crap out of it
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.720]   All right, well, I've if you want to follow me on facebook
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:38.400]   I promise to put lots of lots of stuff up there. I don't I don't want to be famous. I just want your attention, please
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:41.040]   You should you should pet your cat

[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:51.200]   Oh, you gotta follow Lisa's feed. She's the cat person
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:56.400]   You said that was the cat's are new the cats are no, we're old
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:04.560]   You know what they're getting spade tomorrow. I will pull a bob barker. Oh, you should you should stream live stream the cats getting spade
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:07.920]   Hmm. I'm gonna say you probably shouldn't do that
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.200]   But we could do a whole thing about like taking them to the cat hospital giving them their last meal
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.960]   And then when they come home show them limping around
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:22.080]   Make sure not to be too professional
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.400]   Right, right shaky cam
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.160]   Yeah, can you do this with a can you do you must be able to just do with your
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:33.120]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, make sure that your awards are in the background my award
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.360]   After my award in the background. I have a major award you know
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.080]   You could wear some later hoes and if you want
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.400]   Ricky Gervais doesn't have later hoes and you could you could beat him on that one. Oh, yeah
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:50.000]   You could own that market. Do we care about uh virtual? What is virtual?
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.920]   Virtual is a company that's yeah, well, it's exactly virtual assistant
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:02.720]   The difference is it's not a sharing economy play they are employees of virtual they had until they laid them off 400 employees
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:05.360]   Wow
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.280]   Bigford company and ever they went from 150 to 400 in 18 months
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.400]   And then they went from outside employees outsiders outside contractors. They were
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:20.800]   Exactly exactly. So the secret weapon. It says it's the secret weapon of successful people
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:22.960]   It isn't they anyway, they
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.920]   A crash and burn yesterday they announced that they were laying everybody off and closing the company and then this morning they announced
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.920]   Oh, start up dot co bottom would be exactly start up dot co
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.920]   startup dot co. I don't know
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.400]   They couldn't afford an m
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.120]   Other thing that's going to run out of money. Yeah, I think there were some criticism of caliconus on this
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.760]   Is he a investor? Was he a bore?
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:49.280]   He interviewed the ceo a couple of days ago right before they went on. Yes. Yeah on this weekend
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.240]   Yeah, he said he had no knowledge. Yep
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:57.680]   But the ceo probably don't burn right. Whoa. No wonder this didn't go anywhere
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:04.080]   750 bucks a month for this virtual assistant. Yeah, it's a weird model and I don't get it
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:09.440]   Well, and it sounds like they went from the contractor model to the employee model
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:13.520]   And that increased their cost by like an order of magnitude. Yep, and then just couldn't keep up
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.120]   And they then they they were counting on
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:24.080]   Infusions of cash from investors who decided you know what? I don't think so and then there was a sudden crash
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:28.960]   But they these these assistants are in your meat space, right? So they can't do my dry cleaning
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:35.040]   Exactly. They cannot do your dry cleaning. They they work in there, you know, their meat space exactly never the twain shall meet
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.720]   That's right
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:41.520]   Let's take a break. Someone someone just put up something on the on the rundown which I was being cagey before
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.080]   Oh facebook live. Oh, yes. Now that it's now that it's out. I was being told things on a
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:48.640]   Tech crunch is reporting. Yeah
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.920]   That it will soon be opened up to I've been showing this article during the entire conversation
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:56.400]   Oh, I see I didn't see that
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:02.080]   I was being cagey. Don't be so cagey. Although I thought john konstein left tech crunch to get a job with apple
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.360]   But again journalists and verified profiles. It's it's another level of me. That's why I just went public
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:09.120]   As long as you follow me
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.320]   If everybody who watches this show goes immediately to facebook.com/ by the way, I can't get leo loport
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.600]   Somebody has that
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:20.080]   So facebook.com/leo g leport. That's about leo loport.xyz
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.480]   There's another leo loport. I don't know why they say I can't have it
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:28.080]   Maybe they're saving it for me
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.080]   Yeah, that's when you go there. Yeah
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.920]   Sorry, this content isn't available right now
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:37.040]   Oh, maybe you can get it. How could I get it?
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.840]   Well, ask the nice people on facebook
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.480]   Somebody had it probably somebody impersonating me had it is what it was. Yeah, maybe you can get it
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:50.400]   But it wouldn't be very you know the people impressed there, right? Don't you know? I know anybody
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.880]   I intentionally don't know anybody if I knew somebody I'd feel bad when I say bad things about it
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.880]   No, I don't want to know anybody
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.880]   Well, then you can ask her to see me

[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:03.120]   battle
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:06.240]   What do you got to do? I don't have a tool
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:08.960]   You've got nothing
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:14.480]   You have nothing you have a tip for me to get into facebook's good graces so I can live do live video
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:21.040]   I think you should try and lean closer to the camera. Yeah, I'm getting my teeth filed
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:26.160]   I have a great idea
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:32.400]   It's an aluminium tie about that aluminium teeth
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:35.680]   They are very sharp
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.080]   And uh, Matthew, whoa, I saw that somebody ducked behind me
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:48.640]   Do you have anything for us? Actually jeff will do a number. Okay, because then we want to save this okay best for last
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:55.600]   Cake at the end. I'll do a report from uh page fair and adobe vnet 2015 ad blocking. Oh, I saw this
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:00.080]   Estimated loss of global revenue due to blocked advertising during
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:04.080]   2015 was well, we're not over 2015 yet
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.440]   But anyway 21.8 billion dollars
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:11.760]   I don't buy it. Yep. Well, no, how would you measure it?
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:19.120]   Oh, they have the methodology. This is like how much money the the movie industry lost from from from pirated downloads. I don't think
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:23.520]   They would well one thing they do know and this is uh, I think
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:28.960]   Telling is that there's been a 41 percent increase in using ad blockers. Yes
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.920]   11 percent in the united states the number one state for ad blockers is Oregon
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:37.920]   Uh figures, you know, we we talked about this on tech news today
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:42.320]   I mean we heard from some some very uh savvy users who said you know what
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:46.240]   the the the the elephant in the living room is that
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:54.800]   Ad blocking software is being used as a protection right from security for malware. Yeah, exactly. It's all about chavascript. Yes
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:57.440]   And I understand that I do
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:04.080]   And actually it's also about slow loading pages. Yes, a lot of garbage. Yeah, it's it's yeah, and and you know, I'm thinking about this
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.800]   Right in a column about this
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:10.080]   Now that I have to write one is is that it's going to help me out here
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.840]   I think that advertising itself as a form is getting worse and worse and worse
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:19.040]   Right the form because it's getting more desperate to to trick us
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:23.360]   Uh, and I'm I'm not a fan of native advertising. I think that um
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.560]   uh, you know headlines that aim to say
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:34.160]   This will change your life. Uh, uh, lots of ways to try to fool us and it's and and and bad pop-ups and all kinds of things
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.880]   It's becoming more and more and more desperate and so yeah, we kind of deserve
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.280]   Wait a minute. I gotta point out that ad blocking will give you more native
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.040]   Advertising well, that's one way to try because it doesn't get blocked
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:49.040]   It'll give you more product placement
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:53.920]   It'll give you more of the kinds of of sneaky ads that can get around ad blockers
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:59.760]   So Matthew funny you should ask one answer is if you go to, um, youtube
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:03.360]   And you start an ad there and you don't watch it
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:08.400]   In true view the advertisers in pay. So what does the advertiser motivated to do make a good ad?
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:13.680]   Really clever amazing ads. Yeah, uh, what is the second motivation is to give me relevance, right?
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:16.720]   Don't don't just show me billboards of things that I don't want to buy baby carriages
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:21.840]   I have no reason I hope to buy very baby carriages. Um, you know, so so don't show me that stuff
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:27.040]   Advertising has gotten worse and worse more desperate more desperate if they're just like I argued that we in
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:31.600]   In the content side and journalism side have to go to higher quality not to crap
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:36.400]   In the in the future. Uh, so does the advertising side and we've got to help them figure it out
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.480]   So anyway, although I was just so mark o'arm and uh wrote something
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:48.000]   About this created a service that blocks out ads. What's what's not break which which and which a number people have pointed out
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.840]   Um, but his his point was very similar that the ads are bad
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.880]   JavaScript is bad pages take a long time to load
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:59.120]   This is normal behavior on the part of users to take sort of claw back
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:05.360]   Some of the time that they're losing to to crap web pages and to things that don't load properly
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:12.560]   And so his response was well if you the alternative is you can charge people directly or you can use native advertising
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:15.680]   And the I think there were a number of places that
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.720]   Like publishers who responded well, we would love to do that
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:25.520]   But we can't you can't make a business not everyone can make a business out of charging people directly
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:30.320]   Um and even like some people who could do that. Maybe they don't want to do that
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.320]   Advertising is the only thing they have available
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:34.800]   There isn't enough money
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:41.040]   From what that that red lines journalism. It's only for the rich who can afford it. It limits the audience limits the growth
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.800]   Um, I'm not a paywall fan never never you know, I'll say my books happily, but paywalls are not the answer
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:52.720]   And native advertising is not the answer either relevance and quality are going to be the only answers
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:58.080]   So then we just have to wait for advertising to get better. I think we've got to help them get better
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:01.120]   We've got we that's that's the problem. We've got to take that on even in a journalism school
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:04.720]   I'm now seeing that i've got to take on advertising. That's going to be controversial
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:07.360]   Uh, why would you help advertisers?
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:10.960]   Uh, it's not like a journalism is called teaching flax which we don't do and I don't want to do
[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:14.480]   But it does say that if we're gonna still get support from advertising
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:21.840]   We've got to help improve the efficacy of that advertising. I think the solution is similar to spam filtering and filtering in email
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:24.320]   Basically, I'd love to see a granular
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:30.880]   Blocking of ads where the default is that your shown ads you can also go in and say I don't want ads to do this
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.920]   I don't want ads to do that. I don't want ads to drop cook whatever it is
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:39.600]   And then you can also go in and say when you see a you know a a baby carriage ad you can say I don't want
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:44.480]   Anything in this category, uh, and so you can choose to see ads
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:51.600]   That are relevant to you that are interesting that aren't exploitative that don't this you know, isn't that like malware?
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:57.600]   No facebook has terrible ads completely non contextual. I
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:01.280]   I did you give you some control over what you see and what you don't they do and
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:06.480]   And they hide this or i'm not interested in this right and and facebook is trying to be the alternative internet
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.720]   But on the actual internet it would be great for the ad blocking companies to figure out some way
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:15.840]   To do something other than get rid of all ads. They do that ad block plus
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:21.360]   Yeah, it is as a policy if you aren't an annoying ad and you can also pay them
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.840]   Yeah, if you're gonna go
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.040]   If you'd like
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:30.720]   Um, I think that's still the number one used ad blocker. Yeah, we need a lot more granularity though
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:32.800]   I mean, it's my fear is
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:35.920]   My fear is that ad blocking is basically helping facebook
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:41.920]   So ad blocking is going to get rid of lots of the sort of low hanging
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:47.200]   Junk in ads and facebook is going to be the one that benefits and that in turn is going to
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:51.360]   convince more media companies to do deals like instant articles with facebook
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:57.520]   I think one solution would be to honor, uh, do not track
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:00.880]   I think a responsible companies will do that
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.920]   To stop using flash ads because that's how the malware. Yeah, let's let's just get rid of flash
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000]   Let's get rid of flash ads
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:12.800]   Uh, and maybe can limit a little bit, uh, the amount of scripting that's going on in ads
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:16.960]   I don't know. Let's do it. There's a great, uh, extension
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:19.840]   I'll make this my pick of the week called privacy badger. Yep
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:24.080]   That the eff is put out, uh, and you got to trust them
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.880]   And it will show you trackers on pages and give you a slider that will let you
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:30.480]   Uh
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:35.040]   Block cookies or completely block a domain. Let's note again. Let's note again that
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:38.080]   Number one cookies are not necessarily evil and tracking
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:46.240]   Uh, and and I would argue two things one is that they are a way to in fact get higher relevance than advertising and less repetition and advertising
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:49.920]   And less irritation and number two they're important to supporting media
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.600]   And if you if you if you killed cookies and got rid of them, you're going to kill the content that comes of value to you
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:01.120]   So believe the figure of 21.8 billion dollars or not the direction is still the same
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.320]   If you don't want everything to become behind a paywall
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:09.040]   Then we're going to have to support on advertising we have to figure out advertising and just saying that all advertising is bad
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:15.040]   And all tracking that makes advertising work economically is evil and bad is infantile and damaging
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:21.280]   I love the eff. I love the eff for 99.8 percent of their work, but this is I think
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.800]   But but it's but it's pressuring the ad company to do exactly what you're saying that they should do
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.840]   You know, it's it's serious pressure when you know, this thing is growing that the you know ad blocking and things
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.760]   Like privacy badger. Okay, but there's the screws that we have that we can turn that
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:42.240]   That's a negative way to do it a more positive way to do it is to say here's how advertising could work positively and decently
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:48.640]   And instead you what you created is a huge population up to a third of the world that's now blocking all ads
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:51.120]   um
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:52.560]   Make them operate
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:56.560]   Well, they're not going to see nobody's going to see it and and and places are going to die
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.360]   As a result, I think
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.680]   They're not going to respond to good ideas. They're only going to respond to they're only going to be respond to
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:07.520]   To being squeezed and incentive incentives
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:09.840]   No, that's that a cool effect your own company right there
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.840]   Leo doesn't take crappy ads leo takes ads that he believes in
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:19.760]   He doesn't in a certain way there are things he will and won't do and advertisers want to be associated with that because it is seen by this very
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.120]   Audience as a quality relationships and there's a trust with those advertisers
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:28.880]   and I have I have an affection that spot my heart for harries and casper and and
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:36.000]   Forge should come back and you know those places because they have a relationship, but that does my model doesn't work for a lot of
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.360]   Right media including web websites. Yeah, can't do what I do on websites
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:46.960]   The punch the monkey people are you persuaded by that you can't do it, but it's called native advertising
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.840]   I mean, that's the I think if you if you really want to make advertising
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.480]   Better for media companies native advertising is one way to do it if it's good content then it works if it's bad content
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.480]   It doesn't work
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.600]   I think really good content would be live streaming videos for me on my Facebook page
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:12.080]   So if you all go host your teeth, I want to see your teeth by the way good news if you turn off followers
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.720]   But then turn it back on you don't lose all the followers you had
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:20.560]   So I have 227,000 followers still nice even though I just turned it on
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.280]   Huh, so if you want to see more of me and later hosen here's your chance
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:32.640]   I can better in than not yeah in the later hosen you bet
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:36.080]   Um, yeah, we had this conversation
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:42.080]   I've recused myself on the conversation you just had because I have very strong opinions, but I've expressed them on security now
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:45.360]   It was your tool for steve and I just just talk about this
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.160]   um
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.760]   Yeah, one of the things privacy badger does is it's a little different is
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.760]   uh, they will they they they actually are trying to block
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:01.520]   Advertisers and advertising tools that don't follow do not track right
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:07.840]   So if you want to be so instead of just blocking all ads they block ads
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:14.000]   From advertisers who say we're not going to honor the request of a user not to track. Yeah, and um
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.880]   I think that's a good maybe a good way to do it. Let's well, let's but that's do we need do we need to track this whole tracking is bad
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:27.360]   Doesn't bother me. Yes, you do you do for a couple reasons number one you need a very simple level for um, sorry
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:34.640]   I'm turning orange now. Uh, what color is Jeff gonna be now? It's a sunsetting and it's I know it is. Yeah, uh, it looks like I'm the son
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:36.640]   Trina sunset jeff
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:38.080]   So
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:40.960]   One one is frequency caps, right with
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:45.600]   By putting cookies on you got to know how long who is this person seen this out or we throwing our money?
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:50.800]   That's actually very useful most advertisers want that we certainly we certainly do that
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:58.320]   Uh, on our shows here. That's one of the things there's a this thought and I think it's probably true that there's a ideal number of impressions
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:02.160]   That not too few impressions. Nobody's going to act on an ad too many
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:06.240]   Nobody's going to see the ad you want to get, you know, five six impressions
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:09.760]   Uh, and that's it the rest is wasted money
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:15.840]   Right. The second is going to be uh some measure of of relevance now relevance taking into its stupid extreme
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:20.000]   We see right now, which is so called, uh, retargeting advertising you go to amazon
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.360]   You look at boots those boots follow you around every place you go on the web for a month
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:29.840]   What that says is the data point about your in christian boots beats any value of being in media next to context
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.560]   And it commodifies media down to a zero value
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:37.200]   So that's the kind of stupid and by the way, once you bought the boots it still keeps trying to sell you the same
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:42.480]   Booty box stupid it's stupid right but that's where advertising value is going to go
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:46.640]   And media are going to lose we've lost we've lost that already
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:51.760]   And and and so the only way we're going to fight back is by coming up with means to have relevance and value to people
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.240]   Now that means we've got to have better advertising lots of other things
[02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:57.760]   But the only way we can know you as an individual if we is if we know you as an individual
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:00.080]   And that's otherwise known as tracking
[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:03.120]   And we've demonized this idea of tracking
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:06.320]   What do they know to the point that just having a relationship with someone?
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:11.280]   So my argument constantly is the media have to follow the example of google and get to know you as an individual
[02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:16.800]   And not see you as an anonymous faceless mass because that's the insult that media has given us for the last century
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:19.600]   And now it can change and i'm tired i'm going to get a pizza
[02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:25.440]   Sorry about that
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:32.480]   Your pick of the week mr. Mike yelkin. It's a it's called a bat big ass tablet. Yeah, that's right
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:35.040]   We've seen these before
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:40.400]   Running windows. Yes. This one is a crumb of this book. This is the ace or crumb base
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:46.880]   Touch yeah, this is also as 21.5 inches the screen and then it's got a pretty good bezel
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:49.360]   It's quite large
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:54.160]   And uh, it's I don't know, you know, that's the second time. Yeah, it's it's like
[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:59.360]   Let me look it up on here in pounds. It's asus asus. I'm sorry. It's asir asir
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:04.000]   Chrome base touch the asir chrome base touch cost here's the best part it costs
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:09.600]   $9.99 that makes it attractive has 10 points of touch the non-touch version costs
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:14.480]   $3.29 99 but again, this is like a chrome book this runs chrome chromium
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:20.400]   Chrome OS and uh, it's just a it's a it's a kind of a slow performing thing, but one of the great things
[02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:22.240]   Oh, it's not real fast
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:26.800]   It is not even even with a direct ethernet connection on a very fast internet connection
[02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:28.880]   It's still kind of pokey
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:35.360]   But take rek1 in there. Yeah, which is not a bad processor, but that's a lot of pixels is it is a tour format
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:42.640]   Um two or four what ram it's four gigs of ram. Oh nice. Yeah, and 16 gigs of storage
[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:46.960]   And it comes with a complimentary hundred gigs of google drive storage
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:50.320]   Which is nice which most crumbooks do yeah, and
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:54.880]   It comes with a keyboard and mouse which you can use and i'm using the virtual keyboard right now
[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:57.680]   Which pops up when you you know go to to do something like this
[02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:04.080]   But it goes down to like like almost a drafting table for touch which is great and then it goes up to like a monitor
[02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:06.400]   12 and a half pounds
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:08.400]   Yeah, it's part of the fitness plan
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:14.400]   Um and it's you know, it's 178 degree viewing angle. It's got a 1080p screen the screen isn't great
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.360]   Um, yeah, well for instance from over here. It looks terrible. Yeah, and that's not necessarily a disadvantage
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:24.560]   Although this is the kind of thing multiple people might be using it right? Yes, it might i'd use it for breakfast
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:30.160]   Yeah, as a tray. Yes, put the cereal the eggs on it bring it. Yeah, it'd be great. It'd be great for that
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:34.080]   Although it's 12 pounds so um, but it's you know, it's it's a nice
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:40.800]   The construction couldn't feel more solid. I mean just feels incredibly solid it comes with the keyboard comes with the keyboard and mouse
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:45.200]   And i normally use it with a keyboard and mouse, but for the show i'm just using touch
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:49.200]   It's flexible that way. It is not a mobile device. This is not a mobile tablet
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:54.240]   So carrying it around is a bit clunky and awkward. So it's it's not designed to be carried around
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:58.080]   Well, I just returned the review unit of the of the chrome book flip that I have
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:04.560]   Which I did open up on the show. I never reported back. It turned out to be really slow. Yeah, sadly
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:11.200]   Yeah, um and and as I did think I said on the show it that size screen chrome is not built for touch yet
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:15.440]   Yeah, so the things you have to click on if you do touch only don't work so well, but that's why the screen
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:24.080]   The touch should work. Okay, right? Yeah, absolutely. And so a lot of people, you know, I think I'm recommending more and more that people have multiple displays for different reasons
[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:31.360]   And using a chrome book or chrome base or some chrome o s base device is very secure for email and web browsing
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:36.960]   You want to you want to go ahead and be tracked but not get malware and and not have the fishing attacks and all that kind of stuff
[02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:40.800]   Then do email and most of your web browsing on a chrome book or chrome base
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:43.600]   And this is a great way to do that and then if you have to have another device
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:47.200]   It's a good idea. This could be like the banking terminal. They're so cheap now
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:50.720]   They're so inexpensive that there's no reason not to do this this supports the visa
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:54.720]   Mounting interface standards so you can mount it on put it on the wall home or whatever on the wall
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:58.960]   Whatever. This is the return of the kitchen computer exactly so it's at 430 bucks
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:04.960]   I don't see any reason why anybody wouldn't want to get this for the kitchen for just have around the house to have on your desk
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:07.040]   Get two of them get one for the kids
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:10.560]   It's a chrome book or it's a giant chrome book that supports touch
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:15.840]   And I see I see a bob's couch soon set up with this built-in. Yes. Oh
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:18.800]   Yes, wouldn't that be great
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:22.080]   Yeah
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:28.480]   It's gotta be it's not a lap. You can't lap this. This is this is a table or a wall. Oh, press your lap
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:30.640]   If it's kind of visa mount, that's kind of cool
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:34.160]   You can for twice as much as the actual cost of the computer right have a of an arm
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:39.040]   Articulating arm one use case you put this on your desk at at at home
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:42.800]   And you have another one at work and you don't carry anything back and forth from home work
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:45.040]   You just sit down and all that stuff is in the cloud
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.640]   Yeah, and you can do nowadays as as we've discussed on the show
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:53.760]   Multiple times with the chrome books you can do everything just about I'm I'm very
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:58.880]   I completely as everybody knows changed my tune on these things. I really like that books
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:04.720]   I love the pixel and they give you enormous this again. We need a pixel version of this right a high end
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:09.680]   It would be 2000 bucks. Yeah. Okay. So here's all right now that google is off on its own
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:15.520]   Sundar did chrome did android. Yeah, do you think that the chrome the chrome browser?
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:18.560]   I'm sure is is safe. Oh, yeah, do you ever make another pixel?
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:27.120]   I think so. Yeah, I mean just just for google employees and you know in alphabet employees to help so um
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.160]   Let me suggest this would be a great bathroom computer. Although
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:35.920]   Uh, you matter of all but don't get the touch don't get the touch version. Yeah. Hey, could I dissure a camera on it?
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:39.920]   Is it a decent camera? Yeah, there's a camera that I do my facebook live stream. You could yes get it
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:41.920]   You get a cat
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.560]   And and go to the biggles. Well the orthodontist and have your teeth ruined
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:49.600]   I think you I think you you know, you're gonna go places kid
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.040]   It's interesting has 10 point a touch because yeah, that's
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:56.560]   Expensive. That's probably one of the reasons why it is so expensive. Yeah
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:59.440]   Uh, nice pick
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:03.680]   Very nice. I think we should wrap this up now since on a high note
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:06.960]   Because anything I say might be depressing
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:12.320]   Hey, matthew. Thank you for joining us from the lake. God. You could have been fish and swimming
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.080]   kayak and canoeing hike and making back

[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:02.400]   Yes for putting up with me uh wanting to be on the show today, but this was an important week
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.360]   It's always always an important week. I'm twig but uh, you were you were scheduled to pick them at the air
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:14.000]   Up the air. It was all kinds of yeah all kinds of logistical things and uh, they moved mountains and got here back in the time to move themselves
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.920]   And that's why I thank them. Thank you. And I should by the way, I should plug that as of today
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:21.760]   I started a new media column in the new york observer, which is called now. Nice
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:24.640]   What's it called? Uh,
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:26.880]   I don't know if they give it a name or not. I actually don't know
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:31.920]   So you're you're back to uh, you're becoming an ink stain rich once again
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:34.640]   I had to I had to admit that I I wrote to um
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:40.960]   The editor who was nice enough to ask me to do this and I thought about for a while and I thought I said, you know, I'm i'm editorially feral
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:46.160]   Um, I don't feel well with editors anymore. You sure you want me
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:51.200]   And uh, he said well, I'm a light touch and so there it is so under under innovation with the observer
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.040]   I argued that we have too many journalists, but I don't really mean it. You'll see what I mean
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:59.680]   You know what this is uh, this looks like a night. I don't I don't know much about the observer
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:04.960]   What's the observers have been a really really neat publication in New York for on. I don't know 25 years
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:09.680]   Was it a print paper? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it still is. It's a salmon color for right right
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:15.840]   Um, but they also have a online uh site called observer. Yeah looks quite good
