[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Coming up on this week in Google, I, Mike, a sergeant, am in for Leo Laporte.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.960]   He will be back at the end of the month, don't worry, but while the cats away, the mice will play.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.560]   And that means starting things off by talking actually about Google.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.000]   We kick things off about Google's decision to cut back on costs, first by getting rid of micro-kitchens,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   and also by issuing its employees Chromebooks in some cases. But Jeff Jarvis says,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.240]   "That's a great thing. We also talk about lawmakers who are regulating social media,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.400]   even when they don't understand it. And we have quite a few conversations about artificial intelligence.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.160]   I ask the panel some compelling uses they've had for artificial intelligence,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   and we even get to the Google change log this week. It's all that, plus the panels, picks,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.920]   tips, tricks, and tools coming up on this week in Google."

[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.480]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. And yes, I am yes or no, I am not, Leo Laport.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.200]   I am instead Micah Sargent, because Leo Laport is on vacation. Don't worry, he will be back.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.160]   But until then, we are going to do this week in Google in probably much the same way that
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.360]   it's always done, which is we'll talk about a lot of things that have nothing to do with Google
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.760]   and some things that do have something to do with Google. And we will find memes and tweets and
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   posts and other ridiculousness along the way. Joining us this week is a Twit host and club
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   Twit community manager and I don't know, a battler of Turkey's Pruitt. Hello, Adam.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.400]   Don't explain it. Don't explain it. Oh, man, lick here. So if you want to know what that means,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   you need to be a club twit member. Turkey's public enemy number one and Pruitt.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.160]   Wow. And this is Sargent. I hate him. I just, I'm imagining now that there's a wild Turkey and
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.800]   then it's got Ants seal of disapproval on the top of it. Nailed it. Nailed it. Nailed it.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.200]   And Mr. Sargent, I have to say, as this week's producer, I at least put some Google stories in
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   here for us. You did. I mean, we got to get at least one of them, right? And just hit the quota
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   that we talked about Google. Yes, I'm actually really excited to cover some Google things so that
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.720]   anytime someone out there goes, I thought this was called this week in Google, you just point them
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.840]   to this episode and then they have to be cool. Yeah, that's it. That's all I got to do.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   Well, we good to go. We are also joined by technology journalist and print historian.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.480]   It's Glenn, the type center, Fleischman. Hey, hey, Mike, that's such a pleasure to be here.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.840]   Now, I like Leo just fine, but well, I'll have to sleep it there.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.520]   Great to be on a show hosted by you. Oh, thank you, Glenn. We were planning for this episode and
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   we knew, unfortunately, Stacey wasn't going to be on this week. And I said, I know we just had
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.640]   Glenn Fleischman on, but I'd love to have him back because we've got a great rapport. So I'm
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.120]   glad you're here with us today. I appreciate it. If we're lucky, we'll do our folksy frontier
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   voices. Oh, we make it. Prospector voices. Yeah, right. Right. Right. Up. Left over from other programs.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.040]   We are also joined by. Oh, he's got it. The Leonard Tal Professor Professor for journalistic
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.520]   and the director of the Tal Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. It's Jeff, the man Jarvis.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.920]   Hello, Craig. We need to quiet. Where's the car? I think it played several times.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.080]   You went so fast. They couldn't get the the Q in there. That's what it was. I was too fast.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.360]   I was too fast. I was too fast. Oh man. How are you, Jeff?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.160]   Good. God, I'm so I am. I too am delighted that you're hosting. I too, likely. Oh, but but I
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.080]   really enjoy your shows and I enjoyed last time you were on here and so I'm glad you're here.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   Thank you. Thank you for having me. Well, as Ant Pruitt promised, we are going to kick things
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.520]   off with Google and this time we're not talking about bidets going away. Instead, we're talking
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.440]   about Google following through with some other cost cutting measures. This time, we're going to
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.560]   get rid of some micro kitchens at Google. So you I have actually have been I'm sure some at least
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.760]   some of you have been on Google's campuses before and while you're there and you know you're visiting
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.200]   if you have a Googler who works there and you get to go around, there are these little places
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.120]   that you can stop and grab a beverage or grab a muffin or grab something to eat or drink
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:03.760]   and Google seems to be kind of rolling back on the spending on these different sort of micro
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.160]   kitchens and I mean, it makes sense. They just announced that they were going to be laying off
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.040]   even more workers and I think some employees were particularly surprised that this was happening
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.880]   at Google kind of thought they were holding their breath for a while thought that maybe Google had
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.640]   pushed through that and got past and ate concerns about needing to or in their mind needing to let
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.680]   people go and so these costs cut in measurements came into place at the same time that we've seen
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.760]   some layoffs. So yeah, I mean, I do I'm curious for all of you, I'm curious to hear your perspective
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.880]   on these sorts of perks that exist at companies because it has often been looked at as a means
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.760]   to not pay people what they're worth and I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Yeah, go ahead.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:59.600]   A company I used to work for we had nice little perks like this at the different facilities and
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.080]   it was good where it was nice to have it there and have some convenience and not necessarily have
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.560]   to worry about going out of the facility to go get lunch and pay extra for stuff that you really
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.720]   don't want and you had people right there in the house if you will that could take care of those
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.160]   little knickknack needs or what have you but then at the same time it also could indirectly
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   encourage working 12 hours like it's like eight hours, you know, so it was sort of, you know, a
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.440]   double-edged sword and granted there were times because in the IT world you're going to have some
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.680]   long days you just it get like that at times. I can't say that the company that I previously
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.760]   worked for really encouraged us to do that but it was nice that when we had those long days we had
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.960]   those extra little perks right there in house but I also get the argument of why don't you just
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:03.040]   pay these folks more and then yeah I agree most people want more money more so than they want perks
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   right? I hate to say as he picks up his sparkling water and takes a sip of free pizza from literally
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.040]   you know as you know I miss watching Windows Weekly last week because I was enjoying the Twitch
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:24.800]   sponsored lunch you know. Well it seems like after the after the long working from home period
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.440]   maybe those perks don't seem as important to people as actual money and yeah I guess there's
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.240]   that like shared sacrifice idea that if you're laying people off everyone should suffer a little
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   the people making on the low end of the totem pole and on the high end did Google really signal
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.640]   anything at the top that they were doing anything about compensation? I think it's great when you're
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.360]   when the thing the company says is I think Amazon did this maybe it was 20 years ago it's that long
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.800]   ago when they had their first glitch in earnings after they opened a bunch of warehouses prematurely
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.360]   and then closed them and then later reopened them again and it was there's no longer going to be
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   Advil or something like that in the break rooms and you're like man you should stock more of that
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.280]   like that's the wrong decision but it does feel like it's not rearranging deck chairs because Google
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.880]   is not in any terrible financial situation it's more like they had to do something symbolic but why?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.600]   I don't know it looks like you know starting to get these things every company is pinching
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.760]   its users a little bit too and I wonder if this is part of the same trend just off to the side
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   I just got a notice from the parking app that we use for parking meters in Seattle
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   forgot paper something right pay to park or something like that or pay by phone and they're
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.360]   like we might start charging you in some areas for SMS and I'm like gosh that sounds very Elon
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.080]   Musk oh SMS is eating up tens of millions of dollars and I'm thinking all the little freebies
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   as users and all the freebies are inside a company as a worker are the companies sort of trying to
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.800]   claw those back after many years of providing things because they're trying to chew off some of the
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.120]   expenses that are that are fixed and they want to get off their ledgers having worked at magazine
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.920]   companies and I have a book coming out in November I just mentioned on the air called the magazine
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:11.840]   for lumesbury I recount some of the culture that I went through there and at time ink when I was
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.000]   there on closing nights because you'd worked until three in the morning and you were really tired
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.080]   and you had to do all kinds of stuff so they catered dinner that was one they had free wine and beer
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   they had pepperage farm cookies all day and you got a limousine ride you know well limousine
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.920]   but a dark car ride home if you work past eight o'clock which means everybody wait work past
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.080]   eight o'clock to get the car ride home right even in the hamptons right then I worked at Connie
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:45.280]   Nast where they they oh I also had time ink if you were a time magazine a steward and a white coat
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.800]   oh my would take around the the liquor trolley honest to god and if people where I was which we
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.960]   didn't have that because we were you know we were day class a but all the senior editors and up I
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.000]   was not a senior editor the senior editor is enough could requisition booze for their credence
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.840]   now once they had an office number two they had a credenza number three they had booze in it
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.480]   paid for by the company right and we all supposed to be expensive counts like crazy we'd go out to
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.040]   live there's one guy I worked with the people who would go to Bloomingdale's and say that couch I
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.600]   think that's about 25 lunches I need to have fake receipts for the lunches and that's how you do it
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:29.520]   oh my Connie Nast we had a beautiful Frank Gary designed cafeteria which was subsidized and also
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:37.680]   cars anywhere also flying first class all this the point of all this at some point comes the moment
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:48.480]   when um the Piper comes for payment and you don't have the same old culture you had and you get
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.400]   ripped apart properly well the old days they lived like kings and queens and now look what
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.360]   happens to them so I think that that's part of the problem too is that you it's part of the hubris
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   oh so I you're absolutely right it's one way to get people to work all hours but it's also a way
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.040]   to say look how wonderful and special and privileged we are like other jobs and other companies
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.920]   and it comes back to roost I'll tell you something funny that oh sorry no go ahead sir well something
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.160]   funny about Amazon I want to say you know often we criticize big tech companies for the bad things
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.280]   they do and one thing they did in the community is Amazon before the pandemic was building massive
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.720]   amounts of office space in downtown Seattle and they intentionally talked I mean they talked about
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.440]   it and was true I know people who work there that they underbuilt the space that you could eat
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.280]   inside the buildings because they wanted to support this neighborhood that they were essentially
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.080]   overrunning and they helped subsidize some food businesses to come in there they invited food
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   trucks in they really wanted workers to leave the building I mean sounds so strange now in the
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.880]   2020 plus world they want to work is to leave the building and go sit in crowded restaurants and
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.200]   support you know pour the money back to the community and it also meant though and I'll say
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.080]   this again for them they didn't want people to work through lunch they wanted to leave the
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.920]   building for lunch they didn't want people to necessarily have this uninterrupted on that my
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.560]   desk I mean people did that of course but they encouraged people and if you went out there to
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.720]   occasionally make the mistake of on a weekday going into the south lake union neighborhood of
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.320]   Seattle and walking around and everybody has an Amazon lanyard I'm like it's actually working
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.520]   and it was you know again before pandemic it meant I don't know probably tens a million dollars a
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.040]   year's being poured into that so arguably we're you know Amazon built inside a city and a Google
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.680]   built in a suburb and a lot of the dot comes built in the suburb so they they did provide amenities
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.960]   because they didn't want someone to take like two hours to leave the campus drive somewhere park
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.000]   right there dry cleaning they're like no no we want to recapture that but also if you read about
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.440]   like I don't know Palo Alto and some of these other places they were overrun at times where it's
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.240]   just there's literally no seat in any restaurant no place you could go the reverse problem is
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.280]   happening now of course but that was there was an intent that of a time that's gone by that's not
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.680]   coming back wow see there's so many aspects to this cold yeah that I guess that's that can be sort
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.320]   of the the offshoot of it as you do then get I was uh reading a book and in the book it was actually
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:17.120]   kind of talking about this was a fictional cult but um the essentially the people as they moved up in
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:23.680]   the in the cult then to become like a higher member you had to this is grisly but have your tongue
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.760]   removed and the conversation surrounding that was what do you read it it's it's a it's a it's a
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.040]   it's a fantasy book but the point is especially weird i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.240]   especially weird for a guy who makes his living by talking to read a book for pleasure it's a
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.640]   it's a strategy that's out i don't know it's a strategy book he's reading it's like he's going
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.280]   i promise i'm getting to the point here the point is without the ability to communicate
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.600]   then they only can rely on each other for any sort of commiseration but they can't talk to each
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   other about it they don't have the ability to go elsewhere and talk to other people it creates
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   this sort of reality distortion field where they all exist in the same place and they have no
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:12.160]   way no means of reaching out they also can't eat uh with with other people and so that is one of the
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.680]   main ways that human beings as just what we are kind of connect with new people or connect with others
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.800]   my point is in talking about sort of these these groups where you end up eating together even if
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:29.040]   that wasn't the original intention you do start to get this sort of groupthink attitude that does
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.120]   lead to oh well this person stayed later i'm gonna stay later we're all gonna stay later we're all
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.960]   in this together we're all a big family we're all working on this and so i wonder if over time you
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.720]   know glenn where you kind of talk about perhaps in the beginning where it was about you know okay
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.080]   we're in the suburbs we also have to make sure that we keep the city council happy that we're not
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.600]   getting people who live here complaining because uh you know our workers overrun the community
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.120]   but then they also see the benefits they start to see the benefits of having these
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   employees working and eating and and i don't know doing laundry together and how that can kind of
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.240]   lead to this culture where you just work work work work work it is surprising that we don't have
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.560]   an employee dormitories in america though i mean that is common in many other countries in many
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.840]   industries including white collar depending on the country you're in and i'm sure i am sure so many
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.240]   companies have thought about like let's just build housing for like a thousand people and you will
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.520]   live and work in a set of connected tunnels isn't that common in nasia well i think that's in
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.600]   Shenzhen right where apple a fox has a huge a fox con rather has a huge campus where they
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:42.160]   offer living and although into to its credit within the context of many other things apparently the
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.560]   living conditions are generally pretty good compared to what someone could afford on that salary in
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.480]   the same places so there is there is some aspect you know it's a patriarchal or a benefactory whatever
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.960]   you call it's like a beneficial oversight of someone's life i don't know i don't know my god i'm sorry i
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.200]   know i'm constrating on the wrong thing oh no here we go but when you don't have a tongue
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.240]   how did they get nourishment um i did just go into gross detail that maybe i'm sorry no it didn't
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.280]   get nourishment went out of tongue sir i i guess you just you do what ant does which is drink protein
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:25.200]   shakes there's a space culture i'm just going to reveal the the book because i feel like everyone's
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.280]   just going to be thinking about that for the rest of the episode yeah yeah yeah all we can think about
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:37.200]   the Dresden files which is about a sort of modern day wizard oh and there's a group of people who
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.600]   essentially work for fallen angels and in order to make it up into the higher rungs of working for
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   these fallen angels they have their tongue removed so oh my god it's so effid weird it's very weird let
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.560]   me let me change this object if i may please please take it away from the other the other cut back
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.720]   it was a jar as you mentioned privilege uh yes a few minutes ago and it it really made me think back
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:07.040]   um with my own personal experience prior to working at that nice company that i used to work
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:14.800]   for for um teen years i had some pretty crappy jobs when i looked back at them um you know i
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:22.320]   remember digging graves with my dad really gee i remember doing crappy jobs like that and so being
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:29.200]   in the position of being in a nice beautiful facility that was air conditioned number one it
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.440]   was an air conditioned facility um i didn't have to wear ready beat up clothes because i knew they
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:44.080]   wouldn't get dirty and stuff like that um had coffee machines and and a gym and a shower and all
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.440]   of this beautiful stuff right there it it opened my eyes and i was like shh i can get used to this
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.600]   i'm keeping this job you know that was sort of the thought that i has like this is a privilege now
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   and i and i'm i don't want to let it go but yet the other side of that is those 12 hour days could
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:06.400]   have added up i mine didn't add up like that but they could have for some people it isn't that
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:12.720]   always sort of the balance that i think because i i can remember uh i worked for my school district
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.080]   back in mrs. and so during the summers they would have jobs if you were you know i've aged to be
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.400]   able to work for the school district i would climb up under the top of the roofs of the school building
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.160]   during the summer and the hottest time of the year yeah paint the roofs with this oh i did that too
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:35.280]   dude you did that yes yes i've done that too i've done commercial building roofing with asphalt and
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.040]   some with that nasty rubber tar and i've yeah i've done all that stuff too in the summer time so yeah
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.080]   yeah and you you have then whenever you do move into something else and it does feel like it's so
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   much of a shift in in everything and so you yeah i don't know i guess what i'm saying is i totally
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   get where you're coming from in terms of trying to find perspective and all these things because
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:04.880]   of course we know suffering is relative and the perspective does matter there and you also don't
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.760]   like having come from something like that working that way and finding appreciation in the job that
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:19.200]   you have you don't want to sort of discount other people's experiences in their suffering in that
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.360]   job that you have because they're yeah it's hard and you should also point out a lot of these
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.240]   companies too they have tears inside the companies too so google and all these issues with some people
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.560]   do get the free lunches and others are in different buildings with different colored badges and they
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.720]   don't have access to their eyes hierarchies within the hierarchies too and the lowest paid
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.240]   workers are getting left out of it yeah yeah however yes what seems like a cutback at google i of course
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:51.120]   i'm going to consider a major advancement and perk for the employees of google oh gosh i know where
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.080]   you're going with this the punishment there this punishment i think but it is not at all it is a
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:03.920]   benefit they're going to default to crow books instead of these me oh piny ass uh privilege uh
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.840]   apples oh amp and my apple i can't work on it let's google you're working at google we make computers
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   called crow books and you're gonna like them we'll see you look wonderful privilege how often do they
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.440]   make their own though i feel like it's mostly the third party manufacturers of it is now yeah
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   they're gonna dig out the old ones that they make they're gonna use these first well if they start
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.680]   making pixel books again i'd be a very happy camper yeah you know that was the point i saw in that
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:39.440]   article um where they talked about developers or exempt from this particular you know so what
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.960]   why is that you know this because those chrome books are not powerful enough to run those developer
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:51.520]   tools and google has the power to fix that but yet they won't so yeah this stuff would have in mac
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.560]   books on campus i'm not sure that's it i really wonder if that's not it because you know you look at
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:07.440]   at um uh friends of ours who use crow books with linux to program right um and i wonder if
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.400]   it's instead the programmers are the upper crust of google and we're not going to piss them off
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.640]   oh well compiling apps is a thing like xcode is such a i mean it's hilarious when you talk to
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.240]   ios developers and mac developers about yeah xcode and it's like you need a jet and you have a
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.520]   you know fan on the thing and you're like you're compiling a fart app or whatever and you're
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.040]   like no it takes the we need the most cpu all this memory and then it fails after and you're like oh
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.600]   this is why apple there's there's one argument that apple had to keep making max and improve them
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   because max is the only way to have enough processing power to create apps for iPhones and iPads and
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   it's that is i don't think that's a joke i think in the darkest days a few years ago when it seemed
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.600]   like the mac was really i'm not even very long ago before the m1 and when it seemed like mac
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.080]   sales were taper off people were saying and including me saying they can't drop the mac until
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   there's an appropriate development of environment that works on an ipad or iphone but not an iphone
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   that is that has got that same half because otherwise you've got a million or however many
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.400]   uh iphone and ipad developers out there can't actually write the apps that makes apple all that
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.960]   money so uh you know since then the macs made a good comeback right but there was uh there was
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:24.320]   that point all right um the other thing where it's it seemed like google was maybe looking for
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.680]   some cost cutting measures uh was with google drive turned out that oh yeah if you had a google
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.280]   subscription a google drive subscription uh or you know as part of your sort of larger google
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:44.000]   package your workspace package you had uh google drive access even if you had the space on your
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.600]   google drive so let's say it was five terabytes or whatever it happens to be and you'd only
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:57.120]   filled it up to three terabytes but you had reached five million items then you would see a cap
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.440]   that would come up and I would say no no we can't put any more uh files into this so it was five
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.120]   million items or five terabytes whichever's first right it may have even been in some cases less
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   storage now we talked about this ant on tech news weekly uh on uh this last thursday or was it
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.480]   was a thursday or was it sunday it was asked to take that's right it would be i was i saw
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.280]   honor and pleasure and co-hosting with you on as the tech guys how crazy is that that was uh that
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   was a great time and we you had mentioned that this was in place well shortly after um perhaps even
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   a monday or tuesday i think uh google said um we take it back now uh this is not a smart move but
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:47.520]   i'm curious what is what are we thinking was the behind the scenes reasoning for making this choice
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.920]   was it uh that five million items even if it doesn't equal that storage space is still
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.400]   too much processing for i mean i'm just so confused as to why we why there would be this cap in the
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.120]   first place there's there's an old programmers joke uh sort of a joke i remember this from decades
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.480]   ago and it was uh you know when i'm running the software when it when it exceeds more than 30,000
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.120]   some things it slows down and oh we'll just find the place where it says 30 30,000 and raised the
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.600]   number right like it wasn't a systemic epiphenomological outcome right that's what this feels like
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.280]   google's like we stuck five million in there when that was a hard limit what's irritating to me is
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.720]   this irritating of you it's not a power of two why is it not a power of two to be a power of two minus
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:41.920]   one like god intended and yet it's five million two two even power tents cool there you have done
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:51.440]   my old part thank you uh google said i have no answer on that uh mr sergeant like the logic behind it
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.960]   it i mean you're googling you have tons and tons of resources and that totally just seemed out of
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.680]   left field google said in a tweet essentially and thank you scudrex in the chat um it did it to
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:10.400]   quote preserve stability and optimize performance and so what i was thinking is if you've got that
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:17.680]   many files perhaps uh if you've got that many files then trying to search through those files
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.040]   if there are that many of them would be kind of uh trouble someone would potentially you know
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.000]   load down the system but i mean they've got all this storage or they've got all this uh processing
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.760]   power to run bard now so you'd think that they'd be able to do exactly you got you've been bragging
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.360]   about your supercomputer it's better than in vidia this shouldn't be a big problem
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:46.320]   to sift through two million files come on google google you're google gosh darn it
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.360]   just add a few more chrome books into the server room and well exactly
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.680]   especially those ones that you google built itself that's they just need to repurpose those
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.280]   they're missing some stories here or take some of those old apples they can't use anymore as
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.920]   employees yeah there you go and even the little processing chips inside the bidets they're not
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.680]   using anymore could be there as well i'm sure sure let's have low computers in them
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.320]   it is funny though sometimes you feel like they slip the top off the reality glass and you're
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.560]   like you're looking at the raw innards this doesn't feel exactly like it because again the number is
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:22.800]   around number it was hard-coded at that but it's like there's most services right people using google
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.320]   drive some people have like five files that are add up to like 700k and other people are storing
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.960]   what it's you know two terabytes or something or five what's the maximum and it's uh and so
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.640]   somewhere in there though usually it means well it scales you know there's there's uh on average
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.680]   people are storing you know like 50 gigabytes or something so it works out fine you have the
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.640]   resources to vote because you can distribute them across as running a service like this you kind
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.040]   of know what to expect so it's weird to have this high-end number that then they're like well we
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   can just roll that back it just it's something is really peculiar about that to me um let's take
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   a quick break we've got lots more to talk about here on this episode of this week in google if
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.280]   you're just now tuning in and you're going that doesn't sound likely oleport you're right it doesn't
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.760]   because it's not him it's mica sergeant i'm feeling good for leo this week he will be back uh at the
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:23.680]   end of april but until then i do want to tell you about sysco maraki who are bringing you this episode
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.640]   of this week in google sysco maraki they're the experts in cloud-based networking for hybrid work
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.000]   so that way whether your employees are working at home if they're working at a cabin in the mountains
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.360]   if they are working on a lounge chair at the beach if they are working from anywhere well a cloud
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.280]   managed network provides the same exceptional work experience no matter where they happen to be
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.840]   you may as well roll out that welcome mat if you're going um is hybrid work gonna be a thing yeah
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.680]   it's a thing it's here to stay hybrid work works best in the cloud and has its perks for both
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.280]   employees and leaders workers can move faster and deliver better results with a cloud managed
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:13.200]   network while leaders can automate distributed operations build more sustainable workspaces
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:21.600]   and proactively protect the network idg market polls research did a report recently for maraki
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.640]   that highlights top tier opportunities in supporting hybrid work first hybrid work is a priority for
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   78 percent of c-suite executives because leaders want to drive collaboration forward while staying
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.520]   on top of or boosting productivity and security but we know that hybrid work also has its challenges
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:50.080]   the idg report raises the red flag about security as 48 percent of leaders report cyber security
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.760]   threats as a primary obstacle to improving workforce experiences always on security monitoring is
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:01.200]   part of what makes the cloud managed network so awesome it can use apps from maraki's vast
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.080]   ecosystem of partners these are turn key solutions built to work seamlessly with the maraki cloud
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.960]   platform for asset tracking for location analytics and more with that you can gather insights on how
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.200]   people are using their workspaces so in a smart space environmental sensors can track activity and
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.120]   occupancy levels so that way they can stay on top of cleanliness you can reserve workspaces
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.560]   based on vacancy and employee profiles this is also called hot desking it allows employees to
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.520]   scout out a spot in a snap locations and restricted environments can be booked in advance and they
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:43.200]   include time based door access there's also m d m mobile device management integrating devices
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.840]   and systems allow it to manage update and troubleshoot company owned devices even when the device and
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.000]   the employee are in a remote location turn any space into a place of productivity and empower
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.840]   your organization with the same exceptional experience no matter where they work with maraki
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:09.120]   and the sisco suite of technology learn how your organization can make hybrid work work by visiting
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:16.720]   maraki dot sisco dot com slash twit and of course we think sisco maraki for sponsoring this
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:25.120]   week's episode of this week in google all right back from the break and i think it's a time to move
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.000]   on to a very good topic and i'm glad that it's here in the list and it i i think this might be a
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   jeff javis topic but we'll see um the the washington post article lawmakers are clueless about
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:49.840]   social media they'll regulate it as Jarvis written all over
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   can i hear i'm ready i am i'm i'm sitting in the pew it's a hard wood pew i've got my offering ready

[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.200]   okay just check me all right see i've been on this tour a little bit
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.280]   i wish i wish i could get to my preacher thing going
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.760]   some of it
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.080]   hello is upon us
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   i'm panicking about moral panic as usual so a good story of the washington post that says
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.720]   that politicians are f and idiots and they don't understand social media and they're
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.600]   and so the utah of course did this horrible that we should talk about i think last week
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:42.080]   week before last two state bills that keep people under 18 off social media which is a terrible
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.400]   thing it happens i'm i i this this folder right here is filled with papers i've been reading about
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.440]   young people in social media and how there's this presumption that it's bad for the mrs
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.040]   presumption that things are worse it's got even jonathan he writes for the atlantic who's writing
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   a book about how the social media has ruined teenage girls lives don't let me tell you as the
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.440]   father of a not too long ago teenage girl there's plenty else that ruins their lives
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:11.040]   there's a social pressure of the the lunchroom is enough to ruin anybody's life if you link back
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:18.000]   to your own life then and and the moral panic of finding the social media as the folk devil
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.040]   that says it's that's where all the problems come in is ridiculous it goes back to every moral
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.960]   panic there's ever been around comic books and video games and rock lyrics and books and novels
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.320]   themselves and so it's just ridiculous i'm glad that to see the washington post let's give
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.760]   actually credit to the author paul walton very good coming along and and saying what's what
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   that these guys just don't understand it and they also don't understand young people
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.040]   that's what i was going to ask and i didn't want it to come off as disrespectful as it's do you
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.600]   think this is an age thing with our yeah yeah of course you're making fun of old people again i
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.880]   realize that and but okay i'll let you um it didn't smile that time that's good very
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:07.360]   very smooth action yeah it is it's it's i i read a there's there's a guy named paul fairy f-a-e-r-i-e
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:14.000]   who collects old headlines and what's great about his his social accounts both on twitter and on
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.800]   mastodon is that he goes back and and the kids these days he'll find a phrase like that and he'll
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.960]   find headlines decade upon decade even in the you know two centuries ago about the kids these days
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.840]   and and then of course the contrary of that is we must protect the kids
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.800]   both of which fundamentally insult the judgment of kids right of our own children there's a
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.960]   researcher i think the world of named dana boy who wrote a book called it's complicated
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.400]   in which he says you know we got to give our own children some some credit and some faith
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.800]   that allow them to learn recognize they will learn they do learn they figure these things out on
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.360]   their own and so to come along and and act this way i think you're absolutely right and it's
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.800]   old farts uh who just don't understand not only social media but there's own children
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.880]   but i i would hate to be it's expediency too though isn't it is that you have a lot of politicians
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.760]   who they know something one of the most popular things you can do as a school district is
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   is flow to levy to buy computers for students or it used to be because everyone's like oh
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.080]   computers that's the future let's do that forget about books and teachers and class sizes and the
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:26.640]   rest one of the most popular things you can do in certain sectors as a politician is say
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.720]   social networks are the enemy they're the real problem right to regulate them and clamp down on
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.440]   them and then things will go back to the way they used to be or be better and if you're people
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.000]   who are progressive buy into that often too much because they don't like the advertising the
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.240]   targeting all the negative messages that are given the reinforcement they may understand
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.360]   all of it and say yeah facebook twitter etc are the enemy and this politician wanting to block it
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.080]   while there's first amendment and other issues but you know it whatever and on the conservative side
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.560]   you people saying it's exposing people to things i don't want my children to see necessarily it's
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.840]   it's a suppressing voices that i want my children to hear uh it it's focusing is changing my child
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   and so it's what can you do that appeals to both sides facebook is evil let's impose regulations
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:20.720]   you the pew survey uh for 2022 you talk to teenagers about technology and the majority of teens say
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:28.000]   social media provides them with a space for connection creativity and support um and and and
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   young people are finding value here and in a time when young people are frightened of being shot
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.960]   in their schools of the climate going nowhere of young women not being able to control their own
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:48.160]   bodies yes i'm going to be political here um uh they need someplace some where to go to have an
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.960]   outlet with friends the times did a um i don't think i talked to us in the show if i did it
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:37:00.240]   stopped me kick me under the table okay the times did a uh a focus group with with middle schoolers
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.600]   and young young people a few weeks ago and in there people were talking about how it's a relief to be
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.320]   able to go online and mute myself and not feel i have to talk it's a relief to be able to go
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.080]   somewhere i could be among friends it's a relief in the other the other so i i screenshot that and
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.760]   i tweeted it and i said you know the kids are all right and they figured it out well the responses i
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.240]   got oh boy um were you oh my god you can't how these kids they're they're being ruined how dare
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.720]   you say this it sounds awful to me they want to not talk how dare they and i said to any of you think
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.280]   can you can you remember the eighth grade lunchroom can you just try for a minute to remember
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.320]   getting on the eighth grade bus and and the social pressure you were under all the hell you were
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:50.080]   under and and be a little empathetic my 15 year old missed most of middle school in person and i
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.840]   don't think that was a terrible thing like i'm sorry they missed their friends they turned out
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.760]   they realized they're more of an introvert they realized too so they were able to flourish in that
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.600]   so there's a lot of downsides but there was something where i was like how do we get this one
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.120]   through middle schools like oh it was all online thank god yeah um i mean everyone you know jeff
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.560]   you know as as a printing historian fellow printing historian i'm often looking at sources like
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.800]   childhood is an invention of the 1800s in europe and america right kind of didn't exist and then
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.880]   it's like oh these little humans that worked now have something called childhood it's mad
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.840]   reverting to that now i saw that he's named the u_s right bring him back child labor look child
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.800]   laborers all over their little hands are good at things in the type of graphic industry girls and
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:36.000]   boys always worked in making metal type because the tiny hands were so efficient but anyway you
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.080]   look at any newspapers i think that's up i'm looking at trying to run i'm looking at newspapers
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.160]   also from like you know looking at the 1800s to the 1950s 60s 70s every time i'm looking at something
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.480]   i'm looking for a particular you know article about a thing or whatever and there it'll be they'll
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.120]   be the headline every every newspaper this is going to ruin the children this new invention
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.560]   called reading reading is terrible for people it ceases them all the memorization and the
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:09.440]   children will become lazy one of my favorite quotes that i have in my next book next year about the
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:18.480]   internet um about the dangers of of of reading and it's a reading yeah and oh where the hell
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.240]   who's going to buy that book wait i'm confused uh uh no no no it's actually about the waters of the
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:31.840]   internet so this quote is called 1795 my site is everywhere offended by these foolish yet dangerous
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.800]   books i have actually seen mothers in miserable carrots crying for the imaginary distress of a
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:45.280]   heroine while their children were crying for bread incredible i can't but this is just going to
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:52.560]   keep repeating itself right i mean we're very predictable us humans it's it's i don't i
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:40:01.520]   if we look back i guess did we ever what did it take to actually convince people that books were
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.920]   not going to be the end of humanity it was time right time is what did it right right so we're just
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.600]   going to keep doing this over and then video games i mean even today still people are saying video
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.160]   games are you know that turning people into bad people so we haven't gotten through that time yet
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.680]   i it's just in the short term while it's all going on good god is it exhausting i think i
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.720]   thought i thought i thought i think you have to agree though here's the one big proviso is that
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.840]   social networks are terrible i mean they are terrible many of them that exist now in in many ways and
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.520]   they are bad in some ways for people in general so are they particularly bad for children are they
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.440]   different than other methods children interact that's something but we can't argue that facebook
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:49.840]   has been saying unalloyed good or even a neutral over time or twitter maybe instagram being the
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.040]   best of them but it's changed culture too so i think my starting point is more can the you know
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.400]   i'm not it's very hard to regulate things in a free speech culture right we have a first amendment
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.960]   and we have commercial corporations have lots of rights to speech there's a lot of freedoms that
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.240]   allow them to work in an unrestricted fashion which is which is good in many ways so how do you
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.520]   regulate something that's producing a bad outcomes in many cases where they don't seem to want to
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.520]   produce put any kind of bar across their own bad behavior so i mean i think that is the
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:27.440]   background for me and then you examine where kids roles are in that more specifically but uh i don't
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.680]   know is it good for adults you just also get to escape their parents which is very important and by
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.160]   the way glenn we met the social media social media is not right well i was going to ask i was
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.960]   about to follow up to ask if you agreed with that statement jeff because it does seem like something
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:47.280]   you wouldn't well i was going to say that from the devil's advocate standpoint you you brought up that
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.000]   that uh survey mr. Jarvis but there's no one who do you think you are leo leport
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.720]   somebody's got to be leo leo somebody's got to be is he's definitely not me i'll say that um
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.560]   but there's just as many surveys out there that are saying the exact opposite of what the survey
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.600]   you pulled up from pew right because children are have we've spoken about it on this show several
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.680]   times how some children are getting suffering from depression because of what they're seeing on
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:23.360]   tiktok with the sensationalism of of living my best life and all of this fake stuff from the
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:29.280]   influence and things like that um so it could go both yeah but i had to buy this book um um for
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:37.520]   the next book uh called the plug-in drug uh 1977 by marie wyn about how television is terrible and
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.000]   is going to ruin everybody and then she revised it over the years because new things came along
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.800]   like the vcr and the computer and video game she was all the same because you're looking at a screen
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.480]   like an end it's not what's on it it's the screen she said certain specific physiological mechanisms
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.520]   of the eyes ears and brain respond to the stimuli emanating from the television screen regardless
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:03.440]   of the cognitive content of the programs in one way transaction wait that was what was terrible
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.080]   about television right so now probably sleep that's perhaps oh this stuff is interactive it
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:15.600]   addicts you right and that's bad hey have you seen the video of bjork describing television
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.160]   now so i think she must have read i think bjork must have read that book because there's this
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.800]   there's this redic i don't think we can show it be well i don't it doesn't have music so maybe we
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.000]   could i don't know but um bjork basically is sitting there it's like an interview for a news program
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.640]   and she's describing television and she's talking about how um every single little tiny pixel is
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:45.760]   shining light into your eyes and that is making it so that it is um hypnotizing you and it is
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.520]   changing everything i'm basically doing the video right now i love this
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:56.400]   you've got to watch your bjork your image is not a big field you're the top the specialized
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:02.240]   industry of bjork impersonation anyway along you should for your book for your book you've got
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.880]   to listen to that bjork interview i'm telling you thank you thank you i will i will everything
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.680]   rots children's brains because because parents want control over their children and i think
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:17.040]   there's a speaking has one multiple parents on this panel it's always a it's always a battle i
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.440]   think there's a battle of like ego abnegation where we have to give up some of ourselves to let
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.560]   them be who they are and some parents don't do any of that and some parents do too much of that
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:33.120]   so when you have another force in there that you can say you can't have access to the bla the
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.440]   written word or the screen or social media it's a it's a tool for parents nervousness to express
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:45.040]   itself too yes well put one is they i saw something about miss a o c
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:52.240]   joining tiktok and it seems like that could be something to end up coming back to bite her in the
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.520]   end i don't know um but i i i get the premise what's that he's great at social media she and her team
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:04.880]   i mean i get her a premise of of basically joining tiktok when the rest seems like the rest of the
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:10.560]   country is like no we need to kill off tiktok we need to ban tiktok um what are your thoughts on
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.880]   anisajavas i i think it's very smart jamael bowin uh who's a it was a really good um representative
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   i'm not sure where he's from oh yeah i love him yeah uh bow yeah uh u.s representative from the great
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:34.560]   state uh new york how can i forget sixteenth district um so he's been out there saying this tiktok
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.160]   stuff is way overdone mm-hmm i think we're seeing a tech lash the tech lash happening here where some
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.520]   representatives are recognizing especially democrats um if we piss off all the kids mm-hmm
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:53.360]   art uh old man joe uh you know uh we like you joe but you know you're even older than germists
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:46:02.880]   and and leport and you're you're not helping our future here by hating tiktok especially because
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:10.640]   there are a number of people who i mean just even casting aside the people who genuinely have
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:17.040]   found joy by going and using that app every day and experiencing new stuff even not thinking
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.520]   about them but the the number of people who have lived out the you know long lived american dream
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.640]   by becoming a content creator on that platform though not only are we taking away potentially
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.480]   they suddenly don't have this this revenue stream that they had and a lot of these folks are not
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:42.080]   sort of thinking in the long term and so i can it could be detrimental to them but it also then
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.480]   results in those folks specifically having this vendetta because they took away this this tool
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.920]   that they had been using to make a name for themselves and we had just seen where uh some of the
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   covid uh the the positive information and the true information and the sort of instructions and
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.600]   campaigns being spread on the platform in a good way uh we've seen the success that the platform
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.720]   can have in terms of getting information to the utes and so to lose all of that and as you're
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:22.480]   pointing out to look incredibly unhip um and not invoke is not great and shutting off the speech
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.720]   of young people so yeah yeah i mean that that's um pretty soon you'll see like oh no no i'm not
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.480]   good nevermind i was thinking about inventing a meme there but it's a meme that i don't want to
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.440]   exist so oh people without talk good yeah i don't hear people with the exactly you know where i'm
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:47.840]   going oh boy um i i still have my stance on you know our our country is picking on tick-tock you
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.880]   you know because of the china connection yet at the same time there's just as much crap
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:48:00.400]   tastic and and disgusting content rolling around on facebook rolling around on youtube um that
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.960]   that slips through the cracks of moderation and you never really hear much about it as much as
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.240]   we're here and well china china china china china hey take care of the house first that's yep
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   hey i've got moral purity here because i don't trust the chinese government's involvement or
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.680]   interaction with tick-tock i don't trust tick-tock but i also killed my facebook account three years
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.440]   ago and i stopped using twitter and musta go over so i have a trainee to the moral hygriad and you need
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.840]   a new sign with with halos on it more accurate here and more accurate here and then my school
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   to the puritan yeah it's i'm just slightly less of a hypocrite than other people when
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.200]   like complaining about tick-tock it's like a punch card right you you have to walk around constantly
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   and it's like if you are less of a hypocrite than the person next to you then they have to punch
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.000]   your card and if you get enough such a good place thing it's like oh i had almond milk i can't i
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.640]   can't now i have to take that off yeah exactly yes right it's like i'm killing bees so now i'm still
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.560]   wearing blue jeans that are dyed with indigo from oh no so then they punch your card instead of their
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.400]   or you have to punch their card instead of the reverse so somebody else is getting i don't know
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.640]   your corey doctor had this concept called woofy back in uh i think it was down and out in the
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:17.760]   magic kingdom like what you call me years ago woofy woofy whf5e and it was it's exactly what china is
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.720]   implemented as a social uh like quality score more or less although there's versus more negative
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.240]   but it was kind of in a you know corey doctor or dystopia and people uh who people engaged with
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.480]   each other and you earned woofy and woofy was sort of your social score and the higher
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.400]   social score you had yeah and you so it was kind of a way you could get things and people would
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.160]   work with you and whatever and i realized that's yeah i need to work i work on my woofy i thought
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.760]   i'm off facebook i'm not using tiktok get that woofy number up all right i'm gonna start keeping track
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:52.400]   of my woofy it's sort of uh what like a modern karma it was like clout just remember the clout
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:50:00.480]   with a cave oh wow it's i remember clouds oh oh me too i hate it plus k in something i don't know
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.280]   yeah all right um let's i think we can take another quick break and then we've got lots more to talk
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:14.320]   about oh my goodness it's just stacked so much to talk about but first i want to tell you about
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:21.040]   mirror who are bringing you this episode of this week in google i got a question for you are you
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   and your team still going from tab to tab to tab to tab to tab to tool to tool losing brilliant ideas
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:32.880]   and important information along the way because of the context switching with mirror that doesn't
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.240]   need to happen mirror is the collaborative visual whiteboard that brings all of your great work
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.640]   together no matter where you are whether you're working from home if you're in a hybrid workspace
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.960]   we were just talking about hybrid workspaces everything comes together in one place online at
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:54.560]   first glance you know you may go to mirror dot com and you may think oh it's just like a whiteboard
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.920]   but it's online but no mirror's capabilities run far beyond that it's actually a visual
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.720]   collaboration tool that has a bunch of features for the whole team to build on each other's ideas
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.240]   and create something innovative from anywhere you can shorten your time to launch so your customers
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.800]   get what they need faster with mirror you need only one tool to see your vision come to life
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.200]   there's planning researching brainstorming designing feedback cycles and it can all live on one mirror
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:27.840]   board across teams and faster input means faster outcomes in fact mirror users report the tool
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:35.360]   increasing project delivery speed by 29 percent you can view and share the big picture overview and
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.240]   ascension when everyone has a voice then everyone can tap into a single source of truth your team
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:47.840]   remains engaged invested and of course happy so of utmost importance you can cut out any confusion
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.720]   on who needs to do what by mapping out these processes these roles these timelines and then
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.600]   do that with several templates including mirror's swim lane diagram so they've got a bunch of
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:02.800]   different templates that you can use a bunch of different diagrams including swim lanes and it just
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.080]   makes sense it's very easy to sort of work through the process and understand who's supposed to be
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:14.720]   doing what when how and why strategic planning gets a whole lot easier when it's visual and accessible
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:20.400]   so you can tap into a way to map processes systems and plans with the whole team so they not only
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.160]   view it but have a chance to give feedback along the way and if you're feeling that meeting fatigue
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:32.880]   well mirror users report saving up to 80 hours per user per year just from streamlining conversations
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.520]   it's that it could have been an email well now it could have been a mirror board ready to be a
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:45.440]   part of the more than 1 million users who join mirror every month like us in fact Leo and I use
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.720]   it for ask the tech guys because we can get every single thing we need on this one board so we can
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:57.440]   see the google doc that we have that has some information in it get access to the tweets that
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.520]   people have sent us access to the emails that people have sent us and you're not having to
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:07.280]   jump between tabs and windows like when you walk through a door you're going to go get something
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.360]   and you walk through that door and then you forget what it was you're supposed to be going after
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.800]   yeah our brains aren't good at that context switch in that moment so this can help kind of keep
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.880]   everything rolling along right there in one spot you out there can get your first three boards for
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:32.480]   free to start working better together at mirror.com/podcast that's m i r o dot com slash podcast to

[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   kind of a fun place to hang out make different stuff create boards so head there mirror.com/podcast
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.280]   thank you mirror.o for sponsoring this week's episode of this week in google. all right we are
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.040]   back from the break and if you're just now joining us I am mike as sergeant infra leo loport who's on
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:16.080]   vacation got jeff jarvis glenn flychman and aunt pruett here with me we've had a great time thus
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.600]   far but now we're going to talk about ai so it's about to get no I could um so every once in a while
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.480]   I we start talking about ai and the chat room just goes here it comes oh not this again oh boy
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:35.520]   look ai it's it's everywhere and um bloomberg it's the new edft it's the new it's but this nft
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:42.000]   sticks around and it's actually a real thing um I find this interesting a large language model
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.240]   trained on financial data and when I say I find this interesting what I mean is I find it interesting
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.960]   that someone finds it interesting enough to create it because it's not I don't care about it
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.760]   myself are you saying how bored are you yeah what you're saying i'm a little bit saying that look
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:06.480]   I get it I get why um why any company I mean that's the beauty right of a large language model is
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:14.160]   that you can train it on different sets of data and then it can actually uh work to to answer the
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.840]   questions that you might have so I don't know um am I able to type into bloomberg gpt and say
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:28.080]   how do I make one million dollars now that that would be great technology that would be great right
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:33.520]   uh but that's not what this is what's so good about though is that is that I think we've got to
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:38.720]   get in the sarcastic parrots paper we've talked about by tennet gibbera and company one of the
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.680]   things they argue is that is that the boys of Silicon Valley and the boys of ai always wanting
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:48.720]   bigger things because hey we boys are like that and and so having bigger and bigger and bigger
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:55.120]   language models is not the goal um and in fact that makes it harder to understand harder control
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:00.400]   harder to audit and and and and keep in quality that in fact you want things that are finite
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:07.680]   uh so bloomberg to come along and say we trained this on financial data full stop
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:12.320]   colleague of mine at the turtlesman school named sundie jonarkar showed me just yesterday
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.560]   how he trained he used chutji tb but he limited it to a certain amount of data about the school
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.320]   so we can understand that so it would get the answers right because it was using the right
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.720]   data and you knew what data it was using less of a chance for hallucination is this park
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.760]   bar babe less of a chance for hallucination which is yes like when it makes up data that doesn't
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:36.960]   exist that's actually really good i like this even the idea of hallucination bothers me because i
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.080]   think i i think one of the ethical things we've got to do with ll abs is too late the horses out of
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:48.960]   the barn over the horizon and already made it into glue but um i think a lot of the problems here is
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:55.920]   that we by by having llms speak in the first person we have to reward supplies the way we think
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:02.560]   it's not too human right well it should say the machine or the program and then also to say that
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:08.960]   it wrote didn't write anything it assembled language okay what they should be saying is you know the
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.600]   program assembled bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.480]   instead it says well i wrote this or i thought this or i fell in love with Kevin
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   Bruce of the New York Times wanted to bring up his marriage and and we buy this as if it's
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.880]   going to have something more than what it is which is a word prediction machine
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:30.880]   um this is where i want to bring up an excellent piece in the washington post from uh tatum hunter
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   consumer technology reporter uh there and it i want to point out it does have a sort of buzz
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.400]   feedy headline but i promise you this is a really good piece it's three things everyone's getting
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:50.960]   wrong about ai but the piece is talking about um taking things past um news literacy and talking
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:57.680]   about ai literacy and this was a really excellent piece that kind of discussed what you're talking
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:05.200]   about there where we do need to think about the definitions think about the terms think about how
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:14.320]   we are not just talking about ai but even contextualizing ai and there was one um point in here that
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:20.400]   i actually we interviewed her on tech news weekly and i sort of made the joke that i felt like i
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:29.200]   was being attacked because um there's the part where uh we're talking about once i let's say i
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:37.280]   asked the ai to answer a question about i don't know if i mix these two colors together at what
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.640]   color do i get or even something like that just the other day i actually did this because i was
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:46.960]   curious what was going to happen i said can you invent three new emoji uh give them names describe
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   them and then for bonus i actually said this in this uh verbiage i said for bonus points um explain
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:01.600]   how one of them could actually be misinterpreted by the end user and ends up sort of going viral
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:10.960]   in its misinterpretation and it assembled uh words that were really compelling and what uh
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:16.800]   tatum hunter was talking about though is you see it do one thing right and then because you see it do
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:23.200]   that right you may start to think that it can do everything right and uh it's not like if i see
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:29.360]   my toddler um walk for the first time that i should then give them the nuclear code launch
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:35.040]   codes because if they're good at this then they're well i'm sure your kid is so smart yeah yeah
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.600]   in that not very specific case it works differently but no i and i actually kind of had to have that
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.440]   moment where i went you know what you're right just because i see it do this one thing correct
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.520]   so really a point i shouldn't give it you know sort of uh free range to to not be skeptical of
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:56.160]   it getting other things right but anyway goes along with what you're talking about there uh and i
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:04.560]   do i like the idea of sort of narrowing with this large language model maybe it's uh instead of a
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:13.760]   grande it's a tall language model it would be nice to because that's what almost what i i would
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   almost want to have a an llm trained to my specific data set so me if i was a specifically if i was
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:31.200]   still doing um consumer tech journalism involving writing it knew my writing i trained it to that
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.600]   and then i trained it maybe to some RSS feeds that came through from different uh articles and
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:45.280]   that i would read and then just to use that as the means of answering questions versus now where i
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.720]   could ask it one question i remember asking the other day i was so curious a how it would respond
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.080]   and be i kind of wanted a quick answer that i knew would take a while to be googling around i was
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.600]   just thinking about um car companies or car insurance i mean or no no life insurance and i was
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:10.560]   thinking how in the world do life insurance companies actually make money because hold on i can tell
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:16.960]   you it's very interesting oh sorry yeah i was gonna say and i didn't know sort of and so it gave
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.560]   some different ideas and then i was able to later in the day use that as my jumping off point and
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.880]   go okay are these three things true and it was right in that case but if it's got access to
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.120]   however much it's scooped up up until september 2021 because i'm using gpt4
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.360]   is is uh what it's going to answer about one of these questions right it may get 10 right but
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.280]   then it gets 11 wrong and if i don't if i give it too much trust i won't know the difference between
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.520]   them well this bloomberg story is particularly interesting because i think they're carving out
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.800]   something like that is is i love this language the complexity and unique terminology of the
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.240]   financial domain warrant a domain specific model now let's feed that into an ai to explain it yeah but
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.920]   it's it's there you know they're saying they're working they're using this data set to improve
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:12.000]   natural language processing which is fascinating because i think one of the great the greatest thing
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.480]   that chat gpt introduced was the notion that you could answer a free form question and regardless
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.920]   of how good the answer was it was typically a positive right it was it was on the topic you asked
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.280]   about and often if not always gave you something in the realm of correctness so you know there is
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.840]   the issue of how of accuracy and what's being derived from and so forth but i see this as i
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.920]   mean natural language processing or being able to make natural language queries has been an
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.360]   extremely difficult thing it's been something people have been trying to solve for 40 years or more
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.000]   because we want to be able to talk to a computer the way that we talk to other people and we call
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.240]   we want to be able to call i mean a lot of companies want us as consumers to put our support requests
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.520]   into a format where they just throw an ai at it and we don't even know and ai gives some good
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.720]   information so bloomberg is i think this is actually very interesting space where they're using this
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.640]   to study how best to be able to produce better answers to natural language questions about
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.960]   difficult things to conceive of in the financial world because the financial world is so
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.400]   recondite right there's so much terminology and and background so forth you need and so it's if
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.320]   it's a tool to improve the way you can ask a question and get an understandable result that
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:36.080]   seems like a shaped missile as opposed to a dropped nuclear bomb well put that's yeah i agree that's
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:49.120]   exactly what it is now um sometimes we take our the technology that we've uh created and we do
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:55.360]   irresponsible things with it and then our parents come along and they slap our hands and say you
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.920]   shouldn't have done that and in this case keep it for themselves yeah and yeah they say don't eat
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   that cookie that was for me um in this case mid-journey is the parent and the cookie is the free trial
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.520]   um we don't get our free trial cookies anymore
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:22.560]   why we can't have the inspapa exactly why can't we have nice things because people put the pope in
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:29.680]   a coat and apparently that's enough to to be to be bad i don't know pope in a rope okay pope in a
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.520]   coat not okay right right what is the what is what are the thoughts here because i oh yes you will
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:47.120]   automatically um cut off a certain number of users who would have done potentially irresponsible
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:55.040]   or silly and perhaps unimportant i guess things with this technology by removing the free trial
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:03.520]   ayo but does this not also limit access to people who main i mean thinking about sort of the
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:10.880]   democratization of this technology or access to this technology doesn't this also cut people off
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.160]   who may not be able to afford it who could be creating really cool things and shouldn't it instead
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:22.400]   be on the shouldn't be the responsibility of the the groups that are making the technology to keep
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:29.280]   it from doing something like a relatively believable photo of donald trump being arrested you mean
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.480]   content moderation yeah that thing those two words that people don't like to hear
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:41.440]   but how do you how do you possibly the problem with that is you're asking the program
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:48.560]   readers to predict everything bad that bad people could do with it yeah and then get blamed if you
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.760]   didn't predict something and they invented it anyway which of course you know look at kevin ruse uh he
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.120]   wanted the computer to be followed up with him so he could write a story saying it fell in love
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.640]   with me how ridiculous i couldn't sleep that night um with my wife because she now knew that he would
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.280]   have wandering eyes for a computer um so i think we've got to be it's back to the story you mentioned
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.760]   the washington post we've got to be more realistic about these things yeah recognize what they are
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:19.440]   and take that at face value the the desire to panic so suddenly and say it could do bad things
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.240]   well so i saw a story i forget where it was today where the their journalist
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.040]   got the computer to say something bad and then wrote a story saying look at the bad thing the
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:36.000]   computer said yeah yeah those stories really get on my nerves because yes you make it do the thing
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.760]   it's go it's doing the thing and especially whenever we see how sometimes how much bending
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:49.360]   over backwards sideways and doing i don't know uh uh triple backflip spiral to be able to even
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.240]   make it do this thing that they want to write the story about that is frustrating i guess i should
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.600]   rephrase sort of what i was saying because you're right it is not that i even want the company or
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.240]   the the group to have to moderate in that way i guess really what i'm saying is it's
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.840]   i don't like that we have to or we think i guess that we have to close down this tool
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:18.320]   um because of the people doing the bad things i almost wish somehow we were better at it
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.640]   we were better at at spotting whenever it's somebody doing a bad thing with it because there
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:28.240]   are people out there who can't gain access to this tool because they can't afford the extra
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:35.360]   money to do it but could maybe benefit from this i don't know yes in our in our international in
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.560]   our executive program that i that i helped started the school uh almost half the students are international
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.640]   and english is their second or third or god knows fourth language i feel like a stupid american i
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:54.080]   only have one and um they're using these tools to smooth out their english and code switch for american
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:02.160]   and english readers right well that empowers them yeah and um you know i've had other thoughts that i
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.760]   think these tools can be used to help people tell their stories in ways they don't feel capable of
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:12.640]   doing it extends writing it extends the the privilege those of us who write for a living have to
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:18.000]   express ourselves well and and i think that's amazing but you're right mica if you cut it off
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.560]   you say oh my god danger danger danger everything could do wrong then we cut off the possibilities of
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.560]   people that we can't imagine how they use it so and what's the harm of putting the pope in a coat
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.880]   and everybody knew it was about i think i think everybody had the same experience i didn't tweet
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.680]   it i said uh it took it to be true i love it took it to be true some people didn't and they
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.200]   tweeted it thought oh i got fooled i just for ten minutes everybody knew it wasn't real i just
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.720]   wanted my google lens to find that code online so i could buy it that's all i cared about that's
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.000]   what i actually what i think is going to happen is that people are going to design fashion and
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.600]   that the machine could make what they've imagined yes what i find funny is that the
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.520]   headlines as mid-journey ends its free trial after fake images go viral we're still going to get
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.400]   fake images for people that decide to you know what i can just go ahead and pay for mid-journey
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.240]   that's not like uh say on twitter the twitterverse was my phone not muted holy moly sorry about that
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:24.960]   well i'll say um like on the twitterverse uh people buying that that blue check to look important or
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.800]   look verified or what have you and end up just being a troll account it didn't stop
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.960]   stop them for being bad actors and in pain to be a bad actor so what's the difference here we want
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.680]   to keep seeing some pretty fascinating images um that are fake also there's a literal meme online
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.880]   called um looks fake you can tell by the pixels people have been photoshopping stuff i know
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.600]   adobe hates it whenever you use it as a verb but oh well yeah you people have been photoshopping
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.480]   these things for years these these kinds of photos for years and just being i mean and i would love
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:06.880]   to talk to the original creator of that specific there are those two specific photos to hear what
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.240]   they had to type in how many times they had to like regenerate it if they you know upscaled it if
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:18.880]   they took one photo and and uh had things added in the background i mean it's not it's not trivial
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.920]   i don't think they just typed well and i i can't be sure but from the look of it and based on my
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.200]   own experiences with the different ai generative tools that i have used it takes more than just
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.200]   typing in one sentence and getting what you want so in that same time that the person sort of tweaked
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:44.000]   things they could have found a photo of um image of of you know white man getting arrested and then
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.440]   just photoshopped trump over the top of it so yeah is it a guy who did the pope the pope of the
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.360]   coat uh said that he was high on mushrooms it was just having a ball wow that's amazing it the
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:01.120]   the coat is sort of mushroom-like so it's really inspired i think really so i'll if i may if i may
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.960]   please i know it's not an democracy uh i just wanted to throw in something from later in the show
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.360]   that i'm gonna now sacrifice one of my numbers for this purpose because it's relevant i know you
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.040]   all are waiting to figure out what it is that um you should get me for christmas i want to give you
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.840]   plenty of time don't figure this out and learn new skills about how to sew things because i have
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   found the puffer coat that i want and i know Glenn Fleischman is gonna want really badly 1998
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   like uh line 98 line 98 yes if bonito you can oh my goodness oh that's lovely
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:44.000]   no it is for those listening the keyboard puffer coat by liminal and the coat is nothing but
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.800]   gigantic puffy keys of a typewriter it's good no i want the one that's that's the type case so
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:58.160]   it's got a giant section for an e and a t and a smaller y's and z's and q's so that's just gonna be
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.840]   and this is what you get for your your collaborator and shift happens i love the octo-thorp being
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.280]   used as the zipper pair that's fantastic that's a great reason notice that i'm shocked that i
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.600]   haven't seen this before so each of those are i mean ever like has anyone ever made a keyboard
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.840]   coat before i don't know what they're i think i'm presuming that it's made up i don't know oh i see
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   it could be it maybe is it liminal a i thought i tried to look at uh i thought liminal was like a
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.400]   generative art thing oh well right that's not what to do is now make this and it should be
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:40.080]   bluetooth enabled oh my god bled yes we can get um phoon to make it into uh on twitter uh to make
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:46.720]   it into absolutely absolutely true keyboard that's hilarious hello glenn i'm tweeting from my
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.680]   i don't know or all of us lory anderson fans some of us might be lory anderson remember her
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.240]   keyboard tie she'd come out and she'd play the keyboard honor tie during concerts it was actually
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.520]   connected back to her oh that was a dream glenn that was a no it's an epsk everything related to
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.400]   lory anderson seems like a dream but it's true i want the letters to be placed so that i can spell
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:14.640]   makarena by doing makarena well all things are possible all things are possible with ai
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.160]   and a sewing needle well here's the thing that'd be funny is eventually i mean i'm actually
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.720]   interested in ai as a generative tool in a different way and it comes up from bits and pieces like
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.040]   someone said oh i was able to get uh and you know one of the llms to it sounds like i'm saying l-o-l-l
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.080]   one of the large language living puddles i was able to get it to write an entire app that i
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:42.320]   could compile and then upload onto the app store for her on a iphone and i think and then they
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.600]   detailed it was much more complicated than a single query but i gosh i we've had there was a
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.320]   conversation that happened i don't want to mention his name because i'm gonna then go off on him but
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.360]   there's a there's a pundit out there not a jeff javis but more like uh well which jeff javis backwards
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:05.040]   we had evil jeff javis i can't do that in my head is that uh wait let me ask let me ask chad gpt to do
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:13.840]   an anagram of jeff javis sivaraj the tarrable terrible pundit but um there's a guy who's always
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.800]   wrong about except by his narrow domain and he was like oh well this is going to replace programming
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.120]   because you would just type a query in and it'll produce a program you need and i'm like no it's an
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:28.320]   amplification for programmers because you type a query and instead of having to do a certain
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.560]   amount of coding work it might produce something that's possibly workable or maybe accurate but as
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.520]   you need it you need to have the expertise to evaluate it troubleshoot it extend it but i do
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.440]   think something like would you create me a cutting uh you know create me a template that would allow
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:48.080]   me to create this puffer jacket in a way that i could then upload it to a place that um there's
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.440]   all these service periods of two fabric cutting laser cutting 3d printing whatever it would be
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.080]   very will Gibson of hill Gibson uh you know just uh uh i want this thing instead of me using fancy 3d
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.720]   software and goggles to do it i'm just like hey here's a thing i want to do and i'm describing it
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.720]   and it creates the stuff for me now that seems more feasible um that that could eventually be
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.920]   something that was created i would like to update real quick i said uh i need a name that sounds
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:23.040]   like jeff Jarvis but sounds evil like an evil twin and here is what uh the ai compiled said
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:30.000]   how about jex javros it has a similar sound to jeff Jarvis but with a more sinister and menacing
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:40.800]   twist jex javros well jex i think sounds perfectly um have your passion evil twin now you get
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:51.200]   evil twin jex javros jex javros jex javros i'm very happy with that uh moving right along in
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:59.600]   the ai uh sort of area we've got ai guys now you know we had the crypto guys that what was
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:06.000]   ether was it ether what was it that they had eth dot eth eth eth eth in their in their names and uh
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.760]   it seems that now we have reached a new level where you've got uh the ai guys now what i want to
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.360]   know is are all these people people who were crypto guys right and they've changed changed
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.600]   to become oh of course but ai guy and by the way during the pandemic i really knew a lot about
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.400]   epidemiology yep they were uh ukraine and russia experts for a while oh yes and now they're ai
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.600]   experts it's a great it's a great hustle though isn't it it's here's how you move from a thing
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.360]   that's bankrupted morally and ethically to uh you know here's how we do this other thing
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:50.640]   i have seen i'm curious um in your own uh sort of research regarding ai there have been a few
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   guides out there that i think can be helpful um sometimes people will publish sort of their own
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:03.920]   interactions with with a well okay see every time now i've got this little jeff jervis or excuse
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:10.320]   me jax javros sitting on my shoulder who depending on what words i'm using on one shoulder yeah jeff
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:18.880]   is like exactly you're tat look at your tagline joe there we go and so i uh no but i
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:26.160]   they have occasionally written some really great um instructions and guides and helpful bits about
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:32.640]   uh you know if you if you ask this way or if you include this amount of detail then it's helpful
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.120]   because i have sometimes found where if i give too much information and it's kind of like what
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.440]   you were talking about jeff where these large language models they just keep making them larger
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:47.520]   and larger and larger and larger which opens up an opportunity for mistakes um that it can be helpful
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:55.200]   to kind of find that sweet spot but you risk coming across a lot of these ai guys who in some cases
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.760]   are selling the exact same pamphlet that doesn't have any new information in it about uh prompting
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:10.160]   and i'm sure that this question has come up before um but i am curious about uh for all of you and
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:16.960]   maybe we can just go down the line um starting with glenn can you tell us about a compelling
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:25.440]   use an actual compelling use that you've had for uh ai b it these these generative ai systems so it
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:31.840]   can be the chat version or it can be uh images whatever well i'm gonna give you two because
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.360]   one i'm borrowing for somebody else but i haven't tried it yet but i'm really looking forward to
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:40.640]   this the first one is uh giving myself uh explanations are very technical topics and i feel like i'm a
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.080]   technical person and i know how to research and whatever but i got i got undiagnosed for medical
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.960]   condition as i keep uh saying it i i was diagnosed with something incorrectly but not
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:56.160]   totally it's a long story don't need to show that part but when i was undiagnosed i got this thing
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.320]   from a doctor was the first reading of a thing of the you know medical result and i was like i
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:06.640]   don't know what this means so i asked chat gpt and it sort of unspun it for me and then i used that
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.200]   to confirm it was accurate and i thought this is great and of course you can't just do that on
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.440]   its own you have to be able to research it to make sure it's telling you something that's accurate
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.720]   but i was able to give it terminology that was too uh sophisticated for me in the medical realm
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.960]   and i think gosh every day people are confronted they're supposed everyone is supposed to be an
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.760]   expert in everything my older kid is going to college this fall and we are suddenly in the last
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:36.480]   year supposed to be experts on uh college admissions financial aid the fats uh the css all of this right
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.240]   i i don't really want to be an expert in it but we became my wife and i as much of an expert
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:46.000]   and much expert as we needed to be so the idea of being able to lower the expertise basis by
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.080]   taking jargon or terminology or or lengthy things and saying simplify i've already had that uh
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.160]   be beneficial that might my second one which is very quickly is i have a friend who's also making
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:02.000]   a transition into researching the past his area's Shakespeare mind is 19th century printing and he
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.640]   said he because some of these models have ingested all public domain sources he's using it to get
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:14.240]   leads on things that are hard to find by searching on pathitrust google books uh internet archive you
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.960]   just ask a model that has it all in there hey what do you know about this and it starts to spit
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.240]   out stuff and some of it again is whoa that's your but uh huh uh huh mr.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.400]   which models have the happy trust in there i don't know yet i got to talk to more but i want to
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.280]   experiment because google books i think is to your homework but so anyway that's a use i'm looking
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.800]   forward to as the researchers being able to say you have all public domain knowledge tell me how
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   to find this tell me i would you right i can imagine tomorrow going to happy happy trust for those
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:48.880]   who don't know is is the product of google uh scanning all this great material with librarians
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.800]   with tons of old journals and books and magazines and and it's invaluable and i would love to be
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:01.360]   able to go to it and say um just use happy trust and find the examples of moral panic around children
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.720]   you know oh that wouldn't be make them up but then it knows it inspires you because it probably
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.800]   will make them up but if they get the stuff actually from the defined source and in any case it'll
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.960]   inspire you mm-hmm i think that's yeah that that opportunity for inspiration i'm i'll name two
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.640]   one that is just kind of silly and one that was actually helpful um so the other day a family member
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.240]   we had we'd been talking a little bit back and forth and they said how are you and i wanted to say
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:37.680]   i was busy but i wanted to say it in a way that was sort of funny and so i said someone asked me
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.040]   machine someone asked me how i've been i want to respond with a hilarious slightly bizarre
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.560]   country-style metaphor a la sweatier than a long-tailed cat and a room full of rocking chairs
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.880]   that explains how i've been incredibly busy lately and i said the response should start out
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.800]   busier than can you give me five options so here were the five uh and then i'll tell you which one i
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.280]   went with there's busier than a juggling octopus and a circus act
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.440]   not great busier than times square on new year's eve also not funny
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.360]   this is the one that i went with and i thought it was funny busier than a centipede at a shoe sale
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:24.320]   oh that's good that's good that's you that's you learned um busier than a flea at a dog show
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.760]   and it's okay and then the last one was busier than a pen busier than a penguin on an ice cream
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:38.640]   delivery mission what that is that so i like that one i only had the one that i chose which was
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.960]   centipede at a shoe sale i thought that was great and then the person that no follow people have no
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.360]   follow up questions the penguin one that's the utility that give me a response that no one will
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:53.440]   if i've done i am done talking to this person give me a reply where they're not gonna say
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:59.360]   hey braids going a little crazy i think i'll july below yeah that's right but the then i the one that
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:08.000]   actually was um helpful and i've been using gpt for uh using gpt plus um to get access to that i don't
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:15.680]   know if gpt4 is available now broadly but my i'm not used to uh having like very very dry hands but
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:21.760]   in the past like month or so my hands have been incredibly dry and cracking and so you're jimson
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.400]   on the county doh well but it hasn't happened to me before i've lived here now since 2019
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.360]   and this is the first time that it's happened so i said you know my hands are dry they're cracking
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.840]   their chapped could you give me a multi-step regimen and some product suggestions for healing
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:42.240]   and remoisturizing my hands uh it started it started off by compiling words including a phrase that
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:47.680]   says i'm not a dermatologist but i can offer some general suggestions for this regimen and what i
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.960]   was surprised by was not only did it give me a really good regimen including cleaning the hands
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:59.200]   exfoliating moisturizing and then uh even providing some ideas for like overnight treatment but it
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.840]   also talked about something that i actually have heard from a dermatologist before which is
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.160]   consistency being important you have to keep doing it to restore the way i don't know you know
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.600]   people get nervous enough about dr google dr chat gpt makes me really right there well this is
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:19.760]   what surprised me jeff is that in the future it actually named real products and that's what i
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.080]   was like wait what it didn't just say you know you probably want to use this sort of you want to
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:30.480]   use a hand cream or you know it said like you want to use o keef's working hands and nutra jina
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.840]   it actually named three or four different real brands wow and this product placement are we
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.320]   going to write that's what i gpt product placement that's what i thought i'm going okay i love it
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.000]   history what's going on here so anyway how they can make money from it yeah
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.440]   underwrite it with product placement brilliant there we go no please don't
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:55.760]   all right jeff you're next in line how have you used it um i propose to use i haven't done i
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:01.520]   talked to the board and i hope i would mention this is show more uh of the marshal project which
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:08.320]   is a wonderful journalistic endeavor about uh justice uh in america where we have two little of it
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:16.240]   and a lot of the people they serve are incarcerated uh fairly large size of their audience are
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:24.080]   considered illiterate um and they want to bring out the stories of the people they serve and it struck
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.720]   me that you could use these tools so that someone could say i want to tell i want you to help me
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.280]   tell my story better now it's a sense of code switching right tell it in the way that the world's
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.600]   going to understand but uh i think there's an upper or even almost exciting is to illustrate it
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:46.240]   i don't have a camera in prison i can't draw i can't show you what it is but i can describe it
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.240]   and get it in a way that people may empathize with and may understand because it's visual um i
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.680]   think that these tools could be used those ways for our journalism students we have some students
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.040]   who come again new york is the world so they which is the second third or fourth language
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.040]   and it can use to smooth out their language make it dull in some cases which wouldn't be great and
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.240]   but i think it's it's interesting to to imagine how it expands literacy for people
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:23.360]   wow yeah uh that is that is a compelling answer and compelling use um and we'll round things out
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:31.040]   with ants uh i got nothing none no no it all of my stuffs have been private um if folks are following
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:38.480]   you know social media you know i've been in campaign mode for hardhead so i've been working with um
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:44.880]   some images of my boy um trying to you know make like little posters and things like that and
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.360]   still trying to quite figure out in painting and figure out you know the image to image process
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.320]   and but it's been fun and created a couple things that look okay and it could still use a little
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.640]   work but that's been the only proof only use i've gotten out of it's just just art and the freedom
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.440]   and you know just whatever you can imagine you can pretty much put it out there as we've seen
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.760]   when mid-journey says yeah we need to slow this thing down and because people can just come up
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.560]   with anything and it's creating nice work nice pieces of art i think i have for the show and what
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:22.400]   we're going on and saying how do i get rid of euro jadian turkeys yes i know how it's called a big
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:31.360]   wooden stick that's huh okay what's a large cooking pots yeah and that and mr uh sergeant
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:38.000]   far as your your hands you know i know a a pretty good manicurist that would recommend paraffin wax
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.160]   and gloves. paraffin wax and gloves i happen to know that manicurist and i would trust that manicurist
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:50.640]   so i'm going to write that down paraffin wax and gloves and i have done that myself so yeah oh nice
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:56.880]   paraffin wax paraffin wax and gloves and works also a popular mystery show
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:06.480]   oh now i'm gonna have to ask jet gpt to invent uh mystery shows called paraffin wax and gloves
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   while that's generating let me ask any of these other ai topics that really stand out jeff that you
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.120]   want to you want to cover before i move on oh i want to make sure not to miss anything that was
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:25.600]   really anybody any of yeah yes of course anybody uh before we move along into the next topics
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:31.360]   like image identification i'll tell you one of the most exciting so uh one of the best things
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.840]   that apple is rolled out is uh it's machine learning based so it's not lm based so far and
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.480]   apple's been noticeably sitting this one out because they're good about avoiding certain kinds of
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.560]   things until they think it's mature and they're like we need to get a lot wash let's all wash over
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:49.200]   us while we're making our 30 profit margins let everybody else put it up but one of the i think the
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:55.440]   biggest improvements in my life as a user of apple integrated products is uh how well they've gotten
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:01.840]   object recognition and uh text recognition inside of images and i would so you know you can search
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:07.520]   now i know search on the word gutenberg in honor of mr jex jex jex sorry jeff javis and uh so lose
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:14.560]   jacket and uh and uh it's javros and i have sometimes there's a page it's like a galley of a book upside
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:19.680]   down at an angle it's three pixels and it will recognize the word gutenberg in that and this
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.800]   changes how you interact with your photos so this uh story meta working on a generative or sorry uh
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:30.320]   an ai model identifying items within uh images i think it's going to be kind of uh there's a few
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.040]   areas that i think according to be both terrifying and important in the future one is every photo
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   that's published of anyone ever that's available publicly will have them recognize regardless of
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.080]   safeguard so you'll be able to do a search and and prove it and i'll find you everywhere and it
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:52.160]   won't matter how much you'll turn laws he's a shadow you'll never find him he's hiding in this
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.560]   in the background um and the other is every piece of audio you've ever been and eventually will be
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.400]   a rec your voice will be recognized identified will be transcribed and scribed every piece of
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:06.320]   text and every image and so some of this is in every object and every topic discussed an audio on
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:12.240]   video and image i think will also be characterized so that's like an oncoming storm and i think we're
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.120]   seeing but in in both good and bad ways like we need it's kind of like california you know we need
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.200]   the water right you need the water uh because we were out in a drought condition but that was too
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.920]   much water let's not have that much so um but i think this is a sign of what's coming is we're
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:31.840]   going to see a lot more of this uh sub recognition so it's not just there's a cat in that but it's
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:40.320]   here's the cat's name it's fluffy you know fluffy i know i i agree with you i did not realize it took
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:48.800]   me a while to realize um a very helpful tool in ios where when i'm in especially in messages but
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:55.280]   it's in any text field uh there's a new little button and when you press that button it is a text
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:02.000]   import feature and it basically uh or not basically it does it opens up the camera and you can do a
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.520]   live view over something in front of you and then it will sort of lift that text off of the page and
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:14.240]   then it gets dropped into that text field so um i'll tell you my stupidest tip my stupidest tip
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.160]   tell us your stupidest tip i've written an article about this stupidest tip so you know when
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.600]   you someone tells you phone number and you have a pen you can't you're using your phone you can't
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.840]   so you write it down and then you're like oh now i have to go through all of the trouble it's like
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:31.360]   the 1890s of dialing the number that i'm reading there well if you write it neatly enough you take a
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.320]   picture with your phone you tap the text recognition thing you tap the number and then it says do you
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.280]   want to dial this number you dial the number that way oh yeah it's the most particularly the worst
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.880]   worst life hack ever because you know typing in 10 digits in america that's too many i don't really
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:53.760]   at that time oh you can be my age it's too hard to remember 10 digits i guess then though
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:32:00.800]   aunt you're talking about how you you they'll have trouble finding you yeah um i mean you are on a
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:08.560]   publicly available video program at the moment so mm-hmm but this this last experiment and i kid of
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:14.960]   course you know we searched for me and googling it came up with nothing but yet what miss nacy came
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:21.120]   up with all kinds of interesting information about her on the show couldn't find anything about
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:27.200]   all that Pruitt and i'm totally fine with that that's good hmm i think should be proud of that
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.800]   i was someone on a site i write for tidbits uh reader was asking a question about how to research
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.680]   classmates for your class reunion they have 750 people in their class and they've tracked down
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.760]   about 500 which is pretty good because i think that's good along with them and they said there's
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:46.960]   250 people we can't hide a herd of are these sites that help you with reunions whatever helpful
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   people are saying maybe not but i was like man that is super impressive that 250 out of 750 people
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:57.840]   you can't search on their name and find them those it's like is this the disappearing class
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:01.920]   that i helped organize a class reunion several years ago it was earlier in the history of google
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:05.520]   and everything else and there are some people even today i'm like god i wonder whatever happened
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.560]   to so-and-so there's not a trace i don't think they died i think they are an aunt Pruitt they are
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.480]   off the radar i missed a couple of class reunions for that reason right there and then
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.520]   folks decided well maybe we should look at twitter or maybe we should look at them and they found me
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:28.160]   there um so yeah i've missed the ten year and i've missed uh yeah i think i missed no i missed the
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.680]   five year or was it no ten year mumble mumble i missed the mumble mumble we just had a very um
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:43.760]   lazy uh student council so none of the folks who were elected that year have had any interest in
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:49.920]   making reunions not that i would be going but still it was just kind of like every year every
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.760]   year we're going to be one of those years yeah it's everybody's going to relive their embarrassment
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.000]   of 11th grade no i can probably not go back they want to meet in the middle of school they blew up
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.600]   they blew up the school at the end of the movie and we're all done never going back
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:12.080]   exo exo um maybe a salon from my high school in lumbard Illinois was Ted Kaczynski the unibobber
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:21.120]   oh lovely arse is probably Tracy Bonham at the rock artist oh i i got a little better oh i got
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.040]   nothing oh no really maybe me you you you are the most famous graduate of his high school that's
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.560]   fine but i put yourself on wikipedia as the most notable graduate
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:38.640]   i'm just gonna stop you who's gonna stop him i know i'd yeah like you have to do it for my teammate
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:44.400]   you go for aunt who go in the lacroi lacroi the inventor of lacroi
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:52.720]   no he played in the major leagues for many many many many years he was my uh high school teammate
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.120]   and not dad can you tell him my favorite flavor is black raspberry please gosh dude
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.480]   then product placement what's going on here i don't
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:13.760]   i'm sorry i i basically i'm saying it's you it's you win you you win um you won high school i did
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:22.240]   want to quickly i i felt bad for um for jacks or for jacks javros so i asked if we could just do
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:30.160]   the other names as well so if you're curious oh my evil twins name is mordrack serpent oh oh that's
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:42.000]   very good that's great very good ants uh evil twin is is axe prowlith so it's like prowl on the end
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:49.520]   oh that's i dig it and then axe prowlith at night yes indeed and then glenn you go in after turkey
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:57.600]   while he's exploding are quicky to admit that the axe prowlith of axe prowlith
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:03.520]   they're all sitting around the radio um glenn you get to choose because i wasn't sure uh which
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:10.320]   of these two were which one you wanted so you have the choice between gased fiendish claw
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:22.160]   or grim flasheard oh you know these sound like halloween names i i used to go with uh with the
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:27.600]   ghoul flesh man oh that's good when we changed our twitter handles back when that happened at
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:33.520]   halloween ghoul flesh man see that's a little bit closer yeah you did better than these uh
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.720]   human beings won maybe it knew that you already had that one and it thought i got a or no wait it
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.240]   doesn't know because it's not alive right right jacks
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.760]   i'm sorry my little friend i'm sorry for saying ai was alive
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:56.080]   all right let's move on um i don't want to talk about twitter so let's not
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.760]   there's not an about you're the boss you're calling all the rest to it let's i know that um
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:08.480]   stacy isn't here but i also like to talk about uh smart home stuff and i am curious uh to hear
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:14.480]   everyone's thoughts if this falls into moral panic area for you or uh sort of societal panic
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.640]   area for you jeff uh and then just your thoughts in general so amazon has this feature called
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:28.560]   sidewalk and what amazon did was they said okay we've got all of these devices in people's homes
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:37.440]   basic story these echo devices and we could take a small little portion of that echo device that
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.840]   is connected to your local uh Wi-Fi and is connected to the internet through your router and we just
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:52.000]   take a small portion of that and we make it available to nearby amazon devices so that they can use
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:59.600]   um that internet connection and they put a cap on it so that you can't you know it won't end up
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:05.680]   harming your bandwidth uh it won't take up all of your network it won't be anything like that
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:12.240]   and this will help in theory uh it sort of it takes a village i guess uh because then you've got
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.520]   all the different ring cameras and all the other stuff that amazon has um it's all working together
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:25.040]   to provide network access no matter where you are um originally if i recall this was a feature that
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:31.120]   amazon had planned to have on by default uh then they decided to have it off by default and so you
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:36.000]   have to go in and say yes i want to be part of amazon sidewalk um what they've just done though
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.920]   that i found interesting is they've decided to open up the amazon sidewalk network to anyone
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:54.320]   who is a developer or manufacturer of uh different gadgets so the idea is that if you use uh sort of
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:02.160]   their sidewalk developer kit then you could also latch on to this network this free network that's
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:09.440]   available called a low power wide area network and give folks the chance to you know make devices
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:16.320]   that can connect even whenever there's not uh full-on Wi-Fi nearby now i think it's important to note
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:25.520]   that we have seen similar behavior uh through many in ISP um lots of internet service providers who
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:33.200]   also give you the router slash modem package will make part of people's networks available to other
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:39.200]   subscribers of that particular ISP and that's what i was going to ask is this similar to that
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:45.040]   um walking out of the neighborhood i can connect to the quote unquote carriers
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.280]   uh Wi-Fi network on my mobile device and still have access to the internet without having to
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.520]   lean on the cell phones um in that case i think it's they're actually if i remember right now this
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:03.280]   could have changed over time but i know that uh like Comcast, XFINITY, like charters, mother companies
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:06.640]   they were saying they weren't going to take from your bandwidth they're essentially going to
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.600]   provision additional bandwidth onto your network to make it available to other people and at one
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.240]   point that seemed ludicrous because they didn't have that much overhead and now it's not as unreasonable
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.560]   you know they're they have sometimes hundreds of megabits per second available in neighborhoods
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.760]   they're just saying like we're not going to impact your network we're not going to apply it
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.560]   towards caps uh it's not there's a there's a firewall i mean i'm making making it sound better
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.200]   than it is possibly there's a firewall virtual level cable cable virtual land yeah exactly there's
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:40.480]   a VLAN between all these things so extensively it's uh it's uh those systems are letting you have
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.960]   actual internet access this is all kind of like little things right it's internet or devices
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:50.560]   it's something needs to do a dns look up or or pull down a weather thing right mica this is all
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:56.640]   like little yeah yeah it's absolutely it is yeah Amazon sidewalk it's not just i can get on your
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:04.160]   internet and do whatever it's uh but one example is Amazon's own accessory which was a mailbox
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:10.160]   sensor where when you opened the mailbox then it would know that the mailbox was opened and
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.560]   then let you know but a lot of times people's mailboxes are pretty far away from their homes and so
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:20.480]   if there was three somebody's device closer to that it would use that internet connection so it is
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.360]   in some ways the same in terms of just that there is internet access out there to be used so that
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:33.040]   it kind of works the same but in terms of how much room they're giving on uh specific person's
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:40.160]   network it's very little the one concern that i saw from uh different companies or not from
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:48.560]   different companies but from a few publications was that due to the nature of Amazon sidewalk
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:56.880]   whenever you were sort of provisioning a a gadget to work with Amazon sidewalk if there weren't too
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:05.280]   many folks nearby who had Amazon sidewalk walk turned on you could kind of geo locate someone's
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:12.400]   property by by turning it on turning it off trying to find that Amazon sidewalk but again that's sort
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:19.520]   of a very specific and it's not as if they can find micasargents Amazon Echo for Amazon sidewalk
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:26.400]   yeah yeah it's uh this reminds me if we go way back is when i was running the wi-fi network
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:33.520]   news site in the Audis uh like 2005 or six a company called phone FON was trying to get folks
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:40.960]   to swap in their own routers and essentially build a public private uh or not public private but a
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.760]   like a homeowner a network of hotspots that would supplement stuff in areas that didn't have
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:52.080]   ubiquitous access before cellular networks had adopted like 3g speeds even and so FON is the
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.600]   first thing like that that i remember and it was an interesting idea but it required hardware
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:01.680]   swaps and it uh are they they're still around yeah FON.com well they wonder where they do these days
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.360]   they um they had to deal with ISPs uh you know legitimate use uh decrements in which you were
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.520]   literally not allowed to do that but then some ISPs got on board some partner i think there's
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.800]   telecom did um i feel like the idea keeps cycling around and it's hard to beat like Apple's
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:22.480]   FON.my network which is crowd uh crowd sourced uh based on the fact there's just like a billion
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:27.440]   apple devices out there that can pass this information it's very very limited sending short
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.800]   bluetooth messages and encrypted uh location information but i think Amazon would love to have
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:38.320]   something like that as well i know google's also i saw in the news this last week that google has
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   or there's a discussion that google may be trying to launch a similar
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:48.400]   system to apples that's device based so but between the three you can have incredible ubiquity of
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:55.680]   of not access but like location information or small data you know moving like a iot networks
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.840]   zigby or something like that um but everywhere instead of just inside a house
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:04.400]   or bluetooth l-e bought by agile content in friday 21
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.440]   i hate it when that happens
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:10.880]   phone is the past but he created the future there you go
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:19.200]   uh yeah i i think it's interesting how different companies are attempting to
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:25.040]   sort of make their network this this all-encompassing network and you know we saw
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:34.240]   after amazon's acquisition of euro um that then there were echoes that when that acquisition is
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:40.240]   sort of completed and as uh goor excuse me as amazon rolled out new firmware updates to those echoes
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:45.440]   surprise there's actually a little wi-fi radio in there that can work as its own little router as
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:53.200]   part of your system uh and with the networking tools available i've thought about uh because i
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:59.440]   read the white page or the white paper excuse me the white paper about the security of amazon
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.880]   sidewalk and i felt pretty good about it and it did have that sort of it takes a village vibe where
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   i wouldn't mind doing it if other people are doing it as well um because i have plenty of room and
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.920]   they only allow so much and it's four things like dog trackers and um again mail trackers and and
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:26.400]   to send it's not for actually viewing a doorbell or viewing an outdoor camera but actually sending
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:31.120]   motion notifications it can do over this this network so you wouldn't be able to use someone's
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:35.200]   connection to stream that but just to get the notifications back to where they needed to go
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:42.080]   uh it's it's a compelling idea but i know that regardless of all of that folks have their
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:50.800]   security concerns um which in many ways are not backed up by sort of how the system works meaning
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.840]   that's why i was going to ask is those concerns are warranted no they yeah i don't think that
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:02.400]   i don't quite understand exactly based on what i read in the white paper and uh in some of the
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.480]   support documents regarding amazon sidewalk because i used to do this show uh here at twit called
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.960]   smart tech today and that amazon sidewalk kept coming up over and over again so i did that deep
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:18.640]   dive and did a lot of research on it and it is a very secure system and honestly like amazon
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:30.960]   is very aware of echo and ali xa as being sort of um in the past especially but in some cases even
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:40.640]   still uh something that folks are wary of for privacy reasons and so they genuinely have uh
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:47.120]   worked to try and combat that and uh you know answer to those concerns that people have so yeah
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:54.080]   in this very specific case um amazon sidewalk i don't feel like the concerns about it somehow
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:47:04.160]   being a privacy issue are warranted based on the data that's available to me all right um let us
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   cover one more topic before we head into the change log oh the change log the change log i've
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:21.440]   heard of this mysterious change log over looked um i run it well now i'm feeling weird like maybe
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.280]   we shouldn't be doing the change nope nope without a spite if you're like yeah you know the old
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.480]   rumbles about it but do it to do it enthusiastically to do it with ver with ver
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:43.200]   bim and vigor i wanted to talk to you three about um live audio and oh how for a while there i
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:50.480]   think especially at the beginning of the pandemic i mean remember hashtag remember clubhouse um
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:58.720]   there were all these yeah all these services that uh touted live audio and people would hop on
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:04.640]   together you'd have conversations um and people would tune in to these live conversations and over
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:11.680]   time the what is it monthly active users or no the downloads i guess of these audio apps have
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:19.360]   just dropped and dropped and dropped and dropped and plummeted um i gave up on on clubhouse shortly
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.680]   after i started using clubhouse because for me it just wasn't compelling but i know a lot of people
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:29.120]   really uh liked these services for a while and i'm kind of curious everyone's take on
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:36.400]   what made them a success in the beginning and why we think they have dropped in popularity
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:43.280]   overall is there just more that's better now or is everyone just typing things into chat gpt
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   for their entertainment these days i think i think it was a lot of the whole pandemic
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   karma if you will people needed contact and being able to connect and hear voices and not
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.520]   necessarily retext some people found that comforting to just just have a chat about
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:09.200]   i don't know red socks or something and or or cats or whatever and then it got to where is
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:14.880]   even more niche where you get professionals out there uh pro photographers i i remember
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.000]   several photographers opening up clubhouse or what have you and just wanting to chat about
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.280]   what they were working on or share some tips and answer questions for people that were trying to
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:32.160]   learn and things like that and then it it was fairly helpful for those folks i get it um but
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:38.480]   after a while i know personally i got tired of listening to them um it turned into the same old
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:46.160]   thing of of a bit preachy at least on the photography side of things and um sometimes it didn't really
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.200]   come off as encouraging to the community in my opinion but i've said that about professional
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.720]   photographers in the past that a lot of them just for whatever reason are just jackasses and jerks
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:05.200]   and don't really they just don't really um do anything to help encourage someone that's interested
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.640]   in this art yeah to go forward and at least try it even if it's just what they phone you know
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.600]   don't just dismiss them because they don't have a body you know a camera body just photography
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:20.640]   is photography you know but then also it seems like all of these little live
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:29.920]   audio things turn more into crypto and nft talk talks and that turned off a lot of people well
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:37.040]   so the fascism that so yeah that that played yeah i think also the rise of i mean discord was
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.800]   certainly doing well or uh beforehand but they have so many they keep adding more audio tools and
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.600]   group things i mean i'm looking i'm looking at to promote tWitt's own service here there's you
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.680]   know the live stream and other kinds of audio chat environments you can do entirely within
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:57.280]   discord and i wonder what was clubhouse to some of these other tools where they gateway drugs for
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.000]   people to go hey you know audio chat with people is kind of neat but i don't want to talk with all
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.200]   these bose those i want to find my affinity community to talk with directly and then i'll use a tool
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.880]   that's entirely my community or one of my communities so so i wonder if overall the amount of group
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:19.680]   audio chats being facilitated via platforms have the minutes still gone up and it's really the
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:24.800]   public ones these things like clubhouse that were overvalued and overhyped did those just twitter
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:31.680]   spaces did those just reduce in value as people found communities i don't know i'm thinking it's
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:40.640]   hype cycle yeah like everything that Jason Calicanis touches it sores up the hike cycle yeah and and
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:46.160]   mark and dreece and and all and and the boys all said this is the hot thing and everybody has to do
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.600]   it and of course they made it especially i'd have an invitation you couldn't really do it
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:58.240]   and then the hype cycle at the at the apogee of the hype cycle everybody else says we got to do
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:06.640]   this too so of course meta does it and reddit does it spotify does it right and they they give up
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:11.280]   sooner than than clubhouse because they don't have a whole company based on it they said oops this
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:16.960]   was dumb this is like a pivot to video why would we do that why were you thinking and and it's gone
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:23.840]   right and then um a bounce now has to say we're still here anybody want to talk
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:29.760]   and and i and i think that it it was the usual overdose i'm not saying it's a bad idea i think
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:36.480]   when you're right i think people see the utility in doing this and people can enjoy it but i think
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:43.360]   at some point um it got to be too big too crazy yeah i was like everything's going to be audio this
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.920]   is the future we're worth billions of dollars and it's like come on you're flashing the fan
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.000]   and then we were proven right smugly we get to say we were proven right yes
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.720]   all right thank you for the analysis genuinely that may have sounded sarcastic i didn't mean
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:05.680]   i just wanted you to talk thanks for the analysis oh uh that was welcome that was yeah who was that
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.840]   they must grant yeah that was more dak serpent coming out there for
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:15.760]   more than dak's more exact serpents and images uh moving along to the change vlogs
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:26.720]   to change what happened the volume on the you see is a little low at some point oh okay
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:35.120]   that's the intro i want those from my shows those are so fun uh who do i gotta talk to to get a
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:41.600]   a stinga like that that's that gpg to make one for you there we go that's what i'll do um first and
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.640]   i you know what we're going to do this i i don't know if this is supposed to be speed round but
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:48.240]   we're speed rounding because actually the first one is it's sort of what we already talked about
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:56.800]   google drive does not have a file cap now it's just the size of the storage cap so if you've got
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:04.720]   30 terabytes of storage space by golly you can fill up all 30 terabytes of storage space
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.680]   until you reach that next limit that they just haven't said yet so who knows what that looks like
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:17.280]   one google files um that is a number folks in case you didn't know uh moving right along
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:26.240]   a google has launched an ad transparency center so you can actually learn about uh where the ads
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:32.800]   that you're seeing in search uh in youtube and on your google display are coming from
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:40.560]   um it shows the ads an advert advertiser has run it shows which ads were shown in a certain region
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:48.160]   and it shows the last date an ad ran in the format of the ad so if you see an ad for a skin car
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.560]   skin car yes that is a thing i don't even want to imagine in my head because it sounds cool
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:59.600]   that is terrifying anyway a skincare product you're interested in but you don't recognize the
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:08.160]   brand you want to learn more about it um you can tap to learn more and then see who or what is
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:13.600]   advertising and see what the ads look like depending on where uh they're being shown so in different
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:20.480]   regions you can see that i think this is great because i like the idea of all of us being able to
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:28.080]   know sort of what company is behind it because if i if i tap on the company for the advertisements
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:33.440]   and every single ad is different and there none of them are related to one another it's not
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.400]   it's it's all over the place or if it's only being shown in specific regions it just gives you a
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:44.400]   little bit more insight into what's going on uh with with that specific google ad so i think that's
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.640]   uh a pretty cool change uh and of course anyone feel free to cut in if there's something specific
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:56.160]   you want to say about one of these changelog moments um but then google search is going to get some new
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:04.800]   features i saw this um and i think this is kind of exciting because i i very rarely travel but
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.000]   i've been a few times in the past year where i have maybe needed i was going to need to travel and it
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.400]   didn't end up being the case and so i used google flights uh to do this but now um there are just
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:24.800]   some features built directly into search including uh browsing hotels so you can uh actually like
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:33.280]   look through hotel images uh to see where it is it it sort of uh presents itself as a story almost
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.520]   like an instagram story one of those where you can kind of tap through and see different images
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:44.960]   see how much it's going to cost um there are also uh with google flight you can actually lock in um
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:52.560]   some prices there's yeah price guarantees that's what they're called so if it has so it's not
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:57.680]   exactly locking in but it's saying uh i'll quote directly from the the blog it says quote if you see
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:02.160]   a flight with the price guarantee badge it means we're confident that the price you see today
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:09.440]   won't get any lower before takeoff so based on sort of their their time yeah it won't get any
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:15.280]   lower oh that's a good point i guess it's but it can't get higher okay so that's not
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:19.600]   price guarantees we're going to charge you more no i don't think they're going to do that oh man
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:24.480]   oh that's i misunderstood that that's kind of sad that sounds like some laurier ball right there
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:30.000]   um it does say we'll monitor the price every day until departure and if it goes down then we will
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.520]   send oh so yeah you can oh they will oh good you can pay for it that's better that's what
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.800]   language is hilarious the price we guarantee we won't charge you any less
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.760]   a new friendly google
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:51.200]   oh that's the right the books weird grumpy possible and then also via google search you can explore
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:59.120]   an area so if uh and instead of actually finding someone who does uh travel guiding you can just
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:06.880]   use your google search toolbar to do that for you um all right a oh you might be excited about this
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:14.080]   uh jeff the google pixel tablet has arrived at the fcc i don't know if it means in person but um
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:20.320]   it's going to feature ultra wideband connectivity yeah we'll explain that too
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:28.160]   oh my god what is that uwb is a ultra wide frequency uh oh we've turned on wide we've turned on glenn
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:37.200]   uh gpt but i've been running about ub uwb for 15 years since 802.15.2.3 i came over the numbers
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.960]   and at one point it was going to be a bluetooth i'm talking all over you now the one point used
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:44.880]   it was going to be a bluetooth personal area networking standard but they never got it to work
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.680]   exactly right so instead it's become this like finding and positioning tool that also carries
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:54.960]   data now i'm gonna stop talking over you so how does it affect my life if i own this well jeff if
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:03.440]   you have any um smart speakers from google in your home then what the ultra wideband chip in a
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:10.640]   pixel tablet would do is let you if you're jamming out to katie parry as you do on your pixel tablet
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.920]   that's me yeah you're just you know rocking and then you come home and you want to make the whole
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:22.720]   house rock then you can tap or move that pixel tablet close to that uh that google nest hub
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.880]   and then it will transfer the music to that and then it'll play throughout your whole home so katie
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:32.160]   parry everywhere as opposed to just on your pixel tablet it's this is uh nine to five googles thoughts
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:40.320]   about why uh they're planning to do this basically ultra wideband is a chip that's in iphones uh apple
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:46.640]   watches and uh the home pod devices that apple sells and so they have all this sort of uh transfer
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:52.880]   mode because of ultra wideband uh technology is just better at determining how far or how close
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:59.760]   and also where in space a device is in relation to another then i can if i'm talking on the phone
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:05.680]   and i come home i can tap my phone uh top the home pod and it will transfer the call to the home
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.160]   pod and then i could like talk out loud if i wanted to i never do that because a i'm never on the phone
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.560]   and b i don't want everybody hearing my call there are no no
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:16.640]   dogs in another person my house but you like uh like that that was a beautiful description that's
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:22.240]   the best description ever heard that's down thank you technology that was great uh it's went back in
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.960]   the day they thought it was going to be a multi gigabit per second uh like Wi-Fi alternative for
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:32.720]   short range networking like within a house instead we have do i remember the standard is 802.11
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:40.560]   a a x or something there's a there's a higher band uh uh what what actually it's a couple different
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:46.560]   things happen one is 5g adopted the millimeter wave uh band that's up at 60 gigahertz that's where
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:53.280]   we got the ultra high or the ultra high speed T-Mobile and other networks on 5g and then in the house
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.480]   Wi-Fi committee in the Wi-Fi group move towards a different higher band technology so now you can
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:05.920]   use 6 gigahertz has been rolling out so you remember there's 2.4 gigahertz for 802.11b and g and then
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.640]   and then n and then we have uh 5 gigahertz is even bigger because there's more spectrum and they can
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:16.720]   be have big wide channels and now 6 gigahertz really started to roll out a bit in 2022 we're seeing a
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:23.200]   lot of it in 2023 so uwb is kind of it's tangential to all of it but it makes this neat package you can
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:29.280]   have super high throughput at all kinds of levels so either in the house and also the exact positioning
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.280]   with a small set of chips now in a single device and the other thing not uwb was all about telephony
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.920]   i didn't know it was i guess it just depends on what you know how it's being used on the uh ios
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:47.040]   or on the i guess apple side in general it's a little bit more about um as the the technology we
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:52.960]   talked about so far and then also uh according to nine to five google google is maybe working on
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:02:00.000]   improving its own finder network so jeff if you know you're rocking out to katie parry and you get
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.320]   home and you get distracted by a wild turkey in your backyard and so you put down the tablet
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.720]   somewhere okay i can't scream because i have no tongue right yes you can't scream because you
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.960]   have no tongue so you go out to the back and then you come back in and you go well you don't say
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.040]   it out loud because again no tongue but you think to yourself where did i put my katie parry tablet
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:25.600]   um you could use that ultra wide band chip that's in it too with your google pixel to find it
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:30.000]   so you could actually look on your phone and say i need to find the tablet and you can move it about
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.560]   and it'll say it's it's 30 meters that way i don't know how big your home is 30 meters and oh you need
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:42.800]   to go right it's it's sort of a warmer colder game but it's better than just bluetooth on its own so
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.720]   there are a few reasons why you might want that uwb in your next google pixel tablet um let's
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.720]   move on we've got three more to hit here um oh no oh no it's getting it oh it's like oh no we've only
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:02.960]   two left before it's getting uh there's a funny little people savor savor yes mmm this oh i'm
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.720]   pulling it out of that chocolate that box of chocolate we talked about earlier this one has a nice uh oh
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:18.160]   is that a marshmallow filling hmm anyway youtube now has a page that's dedicated to podcasts so if you
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:25.200]   are looking for this week in google on youtube uh you can tap on that podcast tab and perhaps come
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.240]   across it so it's just a quick little change where they are acknowledging the fact that a lot of people
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:37.840]   are publishing their podcasts to youtube um if you use the google now launcher i'm sad to say that
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:45.200]   it is truly fully completely and absolutely shutting down i'm a little sad about this because i don't
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:52.480]   use an android phone super regularly but i do have a google pixel uh last year's model and
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:04:02.160]   i always forget that the google now launcher is not really um popular i guess and frankly that
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:06.160]   they've been trying to sort of shutter it and so i'm always wishing that i can use it and it's
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:12.000]   gonna have all that that uh functionality that originally had uh but yeah we finally have to say
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.800]   truly goodbye uh to the google now launcher uh like you're you're okay with that sounds like
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:28.560]   time to move on dude yeah moving on and last but not least um google wants to make sure
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:39.600]   that apps will actually let you delete your account so if you want to participate in the google
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:46.320]   play store and you want to be able to make your app available to folks via the google play store
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:53.200]   the company is adding a requirement that in order to publish your app you will need to make it easy
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:05:02.400]   to delete an account and do that even if you still have the app on your device so this is just i think
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:07.440]   i think this is a really good move um where if you've gone on you've created an account you've
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.760]   published data to that account you've got your usage data and everything in there and then you
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.880]   have to try to find you're going through the app you can't find anywhere so then you have to go to
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.920]   the website and then it's uh in white text on a white background the place where i can actually
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:25.920]   delete my account but when you delete your account is my data still there are they going to get rid
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:32.080]   of it after a month what's going on um i like that google is trying to make it a little bit easier
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:39.280]   and clearer that i am truly deleting an account and getting rid of uh the stuff that's stored with
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:46.960]   that specific company good so all right isn't that a pull from what apple was doing that wasn't apple
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:53.040]   doing something similar they've got basically nutrition labels but for apps and so you can go in and see
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:59.200]   um how your privacy is how your data is being used in in different means so it'll show you
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:03.520]   uh here's how we're collecting your data here's the data we are collecting here's who that might
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:10.080]   be shared with um but it just like nutrition labels can be a little confusing and uh unlike
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:16.800]   nutrition labels where companies are required to report as far as i understand i don't work for
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:22.960]   the fda but as far as i understand required to report everything um the this is sort of a self
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:30.080]   reporting tool and if you you kind of are are just sort of they look at you sternly uh to make sure
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:34.160]   that you've got it all in there so it's not a hundred percent what i'd want it to be glen
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:40.480]   any corrections on that no i think it's uh i think google may be going further than apple here and
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:45.920]   because i don't think apple does the ecosystem and tries to enforce that an account is actually deleted
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:53.840]   off its systems and it sounds like google is actually going to uh enforce this more i don't know
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:58.480]   it sounds like more severely it sounds good um i mean i think you know that's that uh where does
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:04.400]   your data live um problem and uh we're always if we're working with other companies they're always
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:10.640]   going to own some data we have and be able to manipulate it so anything that makes it that has a big like
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:15.280]   i want multi-trillion dollar companies to be on my side yes when it comes to privacy let's just put
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:21.520]   it that way yes i agree all the those multi-trillion dollar companies and all of their lawyers with
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:29.120]   their evil twin names um let us let us bring an end to the change log s wire after your name to
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:36.560]   know your evil there you go that's a good point even just the esq period is enough i go oh i'm scared
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:44.160]   uh all right moving along to our picks oh there's an end oh there's goodness you this is a fancy show
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:51.600]   you have the owner on the show you get everything my god when is my caviar and champagne coming
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:58.880]   this is great all right it's delivered to you via wi-fi oh can you alter wideband that over to me
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:03.200]   all right let's get into our picks uh because now i'm doing weird voices and it's all like they're
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:10.960]   rambling here uh let's start with ant ant what is your okay so it's odd because everything in the
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:20.160]   picks have different uh nouns next to them it's ant's thing jeff's stuff glens pick and it was leo's
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:27.040]   tool so it becomes mica's tool uh so ant what is your thing my thing i have two of them uh
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:34.000]   this go around uh first one is to piggyback off of last weeks where i told you all to just go out
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.440]   there and spend twenty dollars on a diagram dumbbell to sit next to your desk to do some curls or
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:45.920]   some shoulder presses or something just to get moving and got a lot of interesting messages
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.040]   about that so thank you i appreciate that you all appreciate that so now i'm going to say level up
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:55.600]   and go get yourself a pull up bar i have one of these geez
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:02.720]   you couldn't leave well enough alone hey this is this is how everybody's trying to level up
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:11.600]   with and then now it's yeah do you even lift bro yeah i lift my bar you know i had two of the ones
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:17.120]   that you put inside of the door and i have busted door frames because i'm apparently too heavy for
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:23.120]   them so if you're powerful and someone as heavy as i am you might want to get a bar like this this
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.880]   one's only a hundred bucks they make some that are way more expensive but you don't have to get
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.520]   those just get one of these and you can do pull ups you can do dips you can do some pushups on them
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:39.680]   either way just oh like vertical pushups no down at the bottom as uh some handles and you just
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:45.040]   get down there to do pull ups to get a deeper stretch at the bottom of your pushup i was excited
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:54.880]   about an easier pushup not and it's the floor is not good enough for him no such thing
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:01.600]   yeah get yourself one of those racks there and then lastly mine was um i needed a laugh
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:08.160]   just been a little hectic here for me uh outside of work and every now and i just need real
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:16.880]   laugh and i found a good one from mr. Fred here at the dry bar Fred klette and this one i also put
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:21.520]   it up here because it made me think about mr. Jarvis so if you can oh if the audio comes up mr.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.520]   bonita you got the audio for it i think he'd appreciate it mom do you're lucky you get to work
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:30.000]   on cruise ships however for what i do that's not true all the time this cruise that i was working on
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.680]   there was mostly Germans in the audience Germans in the audience and as we all know the Germans are
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:42.080]   jovial brook this is my impression of the German gut laughing ha
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:55.040]   and they weren't really laughing i finally looked at a guy and said why are you laughing he said
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:01.920]   ik for stun to dust nik after they show i found the international hostess and asked her what does
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:07.920]   ik for stun to dust nik mean she said i do not understand i said ik for stun oh no
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:17.920]   but i thought i thought i just thought i was a good one he's a great comedian on um
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:24.960]   dry bar uh youtube channel but he does a lot of the stuff that s frayed clay i'll tell you a funny
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:30.800]   thing which is uh when i was in berlin uh last uh november and i happened be a twitter the evil twitter
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:36.960]   of course there's a uh german uh uh tv writer and comedy writer i met you there and i'm like hey you
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.280]   want to get together and he took me to have he said it's the best apple strudel in the world and it was
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:47.200]   so we had apple strudel out of he style cafe and berlin i could give the it's like einstein cafe
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:52.160]   oh yes okay yeah so you're even yeah so and he's a comedy writer i'm like tell me about comedy in
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.960]   germany and he said we don't really have a tradition of it that's kind of the whole joke
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.120]   difficult they don't have an improv tradition so he has been part of a generation he's in his i
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.200]   think uh that he's late 30s now early 40s he's in part of a generation it's literally
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:12.480]   introducing the notion of of humor to germany that's not like mordant or deep or very dry
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:17.760]   too just like he got a grant to go and study improv in alla it's really amazing so actually
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:25.440]   really imagine that helping bring humor to germany nice that's a tall order apparently it's it is
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:35.680]   um all right let's go to jeff oh what we did today i already gave up my coat okay so um
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:43.600]   uh companies young people want to work for gen z well who guess what's the number one
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:51.120]   company people want to work for young protect the talk um um the taco bell youtube well we had
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.080]   a story about taco bell but no not taco bell youtube oh youtube's close
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:02.400]   and now oh google then still really do hopefully 60 percent google federal
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:09.200]   government six oh this is gen z okay gen z young people young people okay that's what i was
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:13.600]   that's amazing that is awesome even when they hear they have to use crow books and they don't have
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:18.080]   eminemas all over the place maybe that'll change it's good change yeah they've got all those
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:22.720]   movies to make them think that google's gonna have like slides and ballpits and stuff maybe
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:26.880]   but i love that federal government was so high that's awesome yeah isn't that weird
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.360]   has that changed so google 60 percent federal government six percent apple five percent
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.400]   uh let's see going down here i guess we get disney two points to an episode of government
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:43.040]   so uh demonize that's amazing they want to fix it one yeah good good great get youthful people
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.520]   let it but at the same time the government you may want to go work for those companies but it may
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.760]   not last long because there's another story here also from maxios on the layoffs they've been doing
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.640]   um yeah and uh so amazon is the biggest layoffs with 27 000
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:03.280]   better next biggest with 21 000 but interestingly so amazon's layoffs are less than 10 percent of
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:11.040]   the company little old twitter is laid off 33.7 000 but that's half the company oh wow okay so this
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:19.120]   is i see the chart now okay yeah wow google 12 000 sales force 9000 del 6.7 000 microsoft
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:25.520]   to 1000 meta 21 000 um and twitter 3.7 000 but most of the company
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:32.400]   friended the show mr. richard hey it was official for him just a few days ago with march 31st
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.080]   in his time at google so he's officially out looking for work now
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:46.160]   that's stupid that's my happy jolly numbers well i liked the first part of that i was really
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.440]   inspired that the kids wanted to work for the federal government but we can't forget that yeah
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:56.480]   people are unfortunately i was gonna end with the puffy keyboard coat here was a nice way to go out
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:02.720]   but i contributed it you did lower the show you did and so don't forget the puffy keyboard coat i

[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.880]   they can you can't throw them like little kids in the same bed over an eye whatever and so looking
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:16.800]   around and i'm like oh this looks like a good rental and there's a review i'll review in french so
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:20.160]   it's an international like people have stated from around the world french it's such a beautiful
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:28.480]   language a few excuse my french a few are lozier moltre sail a pat on trattanu prison stay insect
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:35.520]   vivon d'on la cuisine in more d'on later fissure a tour and i'm like this is a way presence of insect
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:43.120]   living insects in the food in the refrigerator also dead ones okay okay oh so perhaps the beautiful
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:47.760]   language informed me through translation that perhaps that rental is not the one i want to choose
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:52.800]   uh so thank you airbnb for providing translation services when you're looking oh my gosh
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:59.200]   we've waited um my actual pick is uh i see and i don't want to steal your thunder because i see
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:04.960]   mike you have a carabiner on your list but it prompted me to remind myself to recommend this
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:12.240]   it's a great item from raptic as reviewing a huge number of apple air tags to air tag holders
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:17.680]   last year i'm still working my way through them and uh this one was really impressive because i
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:22.240]   took up lock picking as many people did during the pandemic we only have our own stuff not breaking
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:26.320]   to other people's houses right and i have a extensive kit now and i can pick a number of kinds
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:32.000]   of locks still working on others uh combination locks are often very poorly made and easy to pick
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:39.280]   so this design it's it's an incredibly uh ruggedized metal construction you slip the air tag in there
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.840]   and it's got a combination lock that you can attach to luggage or something else like lock up
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:48.640]   right and uh it's a three-digit combination which is unfortunate because you could sit there
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:54.080]   and in a matter of minutes you could run through a thousand combinations but it takes time and focus
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:58.560]   i have tried using every technique i've watched on youtube and that have worked on other combination
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:03.680]   locks i have my possession including master lock locks that sell for 40 or 50 bucks a piece
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.840]   all of which it's just you with there you spin the things you're great right i cannot crack this
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:12.320]   lock so even though it's three digits it's pretty great can't get anything into the slots any of the
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:19.600]   tools can't crack it by hand by feel uh so uh if you're looking for a simple but well made uh
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:25.600]   rugged air tag protecting holder the only way someone can get the air tag out is they have to
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.440]   sit there and run through all the combinations or they have to take a hammer and a chisel and like
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:35.920]   pound it out of that holder which is made with the polycarbonate plastic so i really like this thing
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:42.000]   uh if you it's it's particularly for the cases in which you want your air tag to be more visible
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.600]   uh there's a lot of products that hide an air tag but if you want to give people the intent
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.840]   hey i'm tracking this yeah where it's at and then this is uh i really like this item
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:59.040]   now that's cool um and yeah it looks nice and sturdy which is which is nice uh my tool as that is what
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:06.480]   my noun says is a it's called night eyes key rack and i've had these for quite some time
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:15.520]   and every time i've brought them up people are like wow uh so it's a little key rack that you put
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:25.120]   um all these tiny little sort of s carabiner clips on and so each one of your your eye there we go
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:30.960]   ooh this way each nope there we go um each one of the items that you put on there can be
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:40.000]   clipped on using the carabiner clip and then i've also uh got like an open spot here this little
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:46.640]   tool is made by night eyes as well and it's a multi tool that has uh phillips and um flat head
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:52.960]   it's a bottle opener it's got a little ruler on there and so everything just kind of looks
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:58.400]   like a saw to get out of jail yeah exactly that as well um i've got my lock picking tool no i don't
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:03.680]   um and so each of these just kind of sits on here nicely but anytime i want to i can just very easily
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:09.040]   unclip something and use that alone i am uh one of those paranoid people who doesn't like to have
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:14.080]   a bunch of stuff hanging on my keys when i'm driving because there was the one car company yeah
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:18.480]   yeah so you you all know what i'm talking about but for folks who don't know uh there i don't remember
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:24.320]   which make it was but essentially if you're knee bumped the keys just right it would turn your car
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:28.560]   off so you could be on the highway and have your car get turned off and then you get into a car
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:37.280]   accident um and so i yeah i love to be able to just unclip that very quickly uh and use the key as
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:42.320]   i need to and then clip it back on after i'm done um so that is night eyes and night eyes makes a lot
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:48.880]   of different products they've got stuff for like pets um they've got these uh easy little clips that
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.680]   are for your keys they've got some that lock as well so you can get the little s clips that there's
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:58.640]   actually a little uh metal spot in the middle that kind of turns and locks the clips closed
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:06.160]   um and then they make uh led lights all sorts of things that are just keychain focused and i have
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:11.360]   used i had the last one i had i had for years and years and years and i finally replaced it with
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:17.760]   new ones because they had just worn out after i don't know like eight nine years um so they've
[02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:24.560]   lasted a long time as well so that is my tool that i think that's pretty cool for the pets to be
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:33.280]   hanging from the yeah when i clip my dog onto the keychain oh lord have mercy all right it was the
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:40.960]   picture of my head i know it's not right no but it is it is it is a picture um folks that brings us
