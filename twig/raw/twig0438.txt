[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380]   It's time for Dweg this week in Google!
[00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.620]   Jeff Jarvis is here visiting from his folks
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.320]   a house in Florida where it's snowing apparently
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.040]   and from Yorkshire, England where it's not snowing apparently
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.280]   Kevin Marks joins us as we talk about the latest
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.000]   from Google and of course all around the world
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500]   this week in Google is next
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   Netcast you love from people you trust
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.420]   this is Twig
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.580]   bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by

[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.140]   this is Twig this week in Google
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.700]   episode 438 recorded Wednesday January 3rd 2018
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.340]   Netzwerk Duchs zetzwens gazettes
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.740]   it's time for Twig this week in Google to show we cover the latest news from
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740]   the internet with Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.660]   he is in Florida visiting family for this brand new year hello Jeff
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.460]   hello there are you President Professor
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.140]   welcome back I was gonna call you the president of journalism but he's the
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.300]   professor of journalism
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.020]   maybe the president of journalism buzz machine dot com
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.780]   I'm hoping to make the president's you know worst in journalism awards next
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.700]   Monday
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.540]   I can't you he announced he's gonna do awards
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   for the best fake news
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.860]   so he is a TV star he's a reality TV star I mean this is like you like
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.620]   giving himself awards yeah so it's done
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.820]   hey look who's over here on my right mr. Kevin Marks
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020]   visiting us I am from the UK indie web dot org hi Kevin last time
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.420]   you're on the show we kept you up way past your bedtime I won't do that this
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.660]   time
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.580]   thanks very much
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.900]   and I'm still fairly late to be honest is it snowy you're in Yorkshire is it
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.260]   snowy
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.420]   and it has been but not the moment we had a lot of snow
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.820]   just before Christmas but it's it's it's been raining since so
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.020]   I run it way there's snow in Florida
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.020]   not where Jeff is but in some of Florida and no snow in Yorkshire
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.740]   and you say and you say there's global warming I kid you not this is
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.020]   crazy cold as a cyclone bomb is about to hit the
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.420]   New England region just as I fly into a town or oh no you're going home tomorrow
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.540]   I hope so well this is this is the global we think it's this the disruption of the
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.420]   power of what it's
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.620]   that that's why you're getting these huge ways of cold working down
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.820]   Oh Kevin Marks don't give us your British logic all of this stupid science
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   come on
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.140]   knock it off the power of what it's only keeps the cold door at the pole
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.380]   because it's warmed up a bit it's sort of leaking out again because the waters
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.180]   isn't as strong
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.060]   oh that's why the East Coast is frozen we're getting a
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.140]   a polar vortex the scary one for us is the
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.620]   the Atlantic conveyor that's the thing that main means that Europe is actually
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.500]   warmer than
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.460]   America despite being north of it and when that breaks down it gets really
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.900]   cold here that happened
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.660]   two or three years ago
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.740]   would you like to see
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.500]   Google's smiles of twenty seven should we start with the smiles
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.580]   all that was happening
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.380]   Google's tribute to selfies
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.980]   a photo collage
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.100]   where can I find this oh is it not doing it
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.860]   oh you do it of your own
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.420]   oh so I have to go to my photos and see if it's done it for me
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.140]   I see
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.420]   do I have smiles no
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.780]   would be in the assistant though
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.980]   yeah
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.900]   I haven't seen this no
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.980]   I'm sad to say there's no smiles
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.180]   what I have any he doesn't he doesn't look like he's smiling
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.740]   that's that's the grump of the year
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.260]   do you anybody else get one
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.340]   I am the smiles now looking like my assistant
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.340]   I just got like the pictures of me walking the dogs and you'll get one
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.020]   like it's my son ice skating in 2010
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.780]   yeah I like those flashbacks is a fun
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.620]   what you want to roll the whiteboards of the year yeah yeah
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.460]   yeah right yeah all the whiteboards you took
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.260]   pictures of god
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.580]   what you won't be getting any of is the pixel see
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.980]   it is no longer in the Google store and I know you this
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.260]   I didn't believe it's two years old I know you love this
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.380]   I do I do I've been using my pixel book instead but I have right next to
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.260]   have a pixel see which was a one of my three backups for getting on the
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.940]   shoulder day
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.260]   and you're on a Mac said to say you're on your son's man yeah I know my son's
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.660]   Mac
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.540]   and he's not a movie otherwise I wouldn't be on it
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.620]   and I actually have a backup pixel see I was given one at some point and I got a
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.220]   spare keyboard for it so I'm set for another year or two
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.660]   so the question I guess you know when you see this is well maybe they're dropping
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.820]   it because they have something to replace it with
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.740]   there was always the rumor that the pixel see was not designed to run Android
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.140]   or was designed to run some strange hybrid of Android or maybe Google Chrome OS
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.660]   but none of that was to be
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.620]   well now with fuchsia coming to the pixel book
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.300]   who knows what Google's OS plans are
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.860]   yeah it's hard to say what fuchsia is no one knows no one knows
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.140]   targeted devices are the Acer switch alpha 12 in the Intel NUC
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.060]   according to the fuchsia documentation do you have a pixel book or no
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.620]   I do I like my pixel book so you could you could install fuchsia
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.660]   okay I guess I will
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.580]   yeah I guess you're gonna have to now yeah I don't even know it
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.860]   I don't even know what few should what it does I know I don't think it does
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.380]   so you have to put your device into developer mode that's not surprising
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.140]   then you boot into Chrome OS at the welcome screen press control all refresh
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.380]   F3 to enter a command shell and a chronos as the user with a blank password
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.100]   this is all normal ah you have to re-enable USB boot okay I've done all this
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.940]   we to install Linux in a Chromebook you do all this right and then I guess you
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.300]   have you've put you somewhere got fuchsia and you put it on a USB key so you can
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.580]   install it all right I promise you by next week I will do it all right we'll
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.500]   see what you see there's no applications for it I would assume even
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.260]   it's it's it's got a lot of language support it looks like when I see me it
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:51.420]   will have a build of Chrome that's true yeah code of conduct how do I get started
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.140]   individual zircon is the micro kernel underlying fuchsia here's the fuchsia
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:05.060]   book but this is all for developers fuchsia is not Linux it says mm-hmm okay
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.400]   okay it's running on a not a Linux kernel a zircon
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.760]   kernel and this is the details of the kernel speaking of kernels you can write
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.360]   code in dot or in Rust that's that's yeah I like Rust mainstream there yeah
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.980]   what's that dot is these oh dark I'm sorry yeah yeah
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.240]   both not dot dot trust comes from the Mozilla Foundation doesn't dart also
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.640]   come from us who's dark come from a dark was Google's one of the
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.140]   tell projects trying to replace JavaScript right and I'm in Rust is a
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.520]   real systems programming language designed to replace C and C++ so yes
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.640]   that's a good that's a good I think those are decent choices speaking of
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.140]   kernels the battle royal has begun over the we don't know much about it Intel
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:03.380]   kernel flaw this is this this is the story that began at all that from the
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.200]   register kernel memory leaking Intel processors design flaw forces Linux
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.000]   Windows redesign Linux has is current I think most of the information comes from
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.760]   the Linux development which is being done in public although Microsoft says
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.260]   we have already patched Windows for this the scary thing is this register
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.640]   article says that all Intel processors will be have to be patched on all
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   computers and use the impact of the patch which involves doing more memory
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.700]   paging will slow these computers down from five to 30 percent Intel today
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:49.540]   responded saying well a it's not just us it's it's it's Intel's it says it's
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.980]   working with many other technology companies including AMD arm holdings by
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.740]   the way Intel stock plummeted while armstock went up this morning because of
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.080]   this Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential corrupt modifier
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.040]   delete data based on their analysis today this is Intel talking not this is
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.300]   not what the register said many types of computing devices with many different
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.400]   vendors processors and operating systems are susceptible to these exploits these
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   are very fuzzy words Intel is making this statement today because of current
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.600]   inaccurate media reports but they don't say exactly who or what is inaccurate
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.360]   they also say contrary to some reports any performance impacts are workload
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.160]   dependent and for the average computer user should not be significant and will
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.680]   be mitigated over time all of these sound good but are so vaguely worded as to
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.200]   not really be meaningful yeah they're workload dependent like if you have no
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.120]   workload you might not notice performance hits that's one way of
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.080]   interpreting it for the average computer user should not be significant okay I
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.360]   don't know who that person is and will be mitigated over time and I'll say how
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.600]   perhaps with the purchase of a new computer I don't know so I'm I'm I shouldn't
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   be harsh I don't mean to be harsh AMD is responding to Intel saying no we
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.920]   don't have this problem don't say we have this problem you have this this is your
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.440]   problem that our problem meanwhile nobody knows exactly what the problem is
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   because well for right for good reasons security researchers aren't telling
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.560]   anybody they're trying to get these patches out before the word goes out
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.960]   which means it's pretty serious yeah ours technically has a has a an
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:40.200]   explainer that starts walking you through the the details of this process of
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.360]   voodoo but a lot of this is somebody somebody's scrubbing on Twitter as this
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.200]   just illustrates how much witchcraft there is in processes these days and the
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.080]   thing is that the processes they used to be you know used to be simple one
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   non-meme machines where you had like memory you had a couple of registers and
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.320]   you moved up between the two and now there's layers and layers and layers of
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.400]   caches but also layers of execution units so well if there's an if statement
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.180]   we'll try both parts of the if statement till they're sure which one is it
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.400]   she gonna happen branch prediction this is called brush prediction spectative
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.960]   execution things like that yeah so because different bits run at different
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:25.720]   speeds they will attempt to execute the code in more than one path and then see
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.120]   which see which one should resolve further down and so the suspicion is
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.920]   that you can do timing attacks based on these different these the effects of
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.720]   these different things on caches and potentially extract kernel addresses
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.880]   that way and then access them but it's not it's not clear what's going on and
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.800]   we'll have to wait for a proper write-up when you hear that you think perhaps
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.680]   of a row hammer which was a yes Android specific bug that used timing attacks
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.400]   in a similar way and they have likened this to what row hammer the only reason
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.280]   we know anything is because the in the Linux patches are being done kind of in
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.680]   public they're they're redacting comments and things but people can look at
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.400]   the patch and say oh this seems to be addressing this I misspoke Microsoft
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.640]   has a patch in the Windows Insider program the betas and it's been in the
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.840]   it's been in the betas since November so Microsoft's 90-bit this was sometime
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.800]   and they say patch Tuesday next week everybody will get this so so what if
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.920]   you if you have your your grandmother and you'll get patched her operating
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.760]   system will get patched no no worry about what Apple's doing although they've
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   been a lot of patches lately Amazon web services and Microsoft's Azure are
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:46.600]   both announcing they'll be down for scheduled maintenance but we know that
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   these these virtualization solutions are vulnerable as well so it's well no one's
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.440]   saying why they're going down this scheduled maintenance is probably something
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:04.160]   about patching so says everything's about me what about the Chrome OS yep but I
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.400]   don't know I think I think the worry is probably more that you'll be able to
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.600]   peek into other processes on the same machine which is less of less of an
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.720]   issue for individuals but a big issue for servers where you potentially have
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   process belongs to other people and stuff in the sideways that way yeah so if
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.360]   you're a cloud provider that's you know there's a presumption that or the like
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.480]   the the lower level page table stuff works and you can build things on top of
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.960]   that that isolate one process for another and if those process actually
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   belong to different organizations and they shouldn't be able to reach other
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.240]   data but that's potentially a problem so if for someone who's providing who's
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.520]   basically sharing service between people in the cloud that's really more
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.800]   dangerous that's actually more dangerous and there was so if you remember there
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.720]   was a problem I'm trying to remember exactly who it was but there was there
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.880]   was some kind of cross leakage problem for someone who was running a CDN where
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.280]   they would get each other's cached pages do you remember that that was a
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:10.120]   bad it's not to go and so that that kind of problem could occur or that kind of
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.600]   thing could be deliberately provoked where you can peek into other people's
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   processes and that's that that's that suspect that's why they're particularly
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.520]   nervous about the cloud service stuff by the way you write Peter Brights article
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.000]   on ours technica is the best so far description of this and he says it
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.240]   specifically affects Intel processors that do speculative execution of ring
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.280]   three code that writes to ring zero memory and that's where the leak happens
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.760]   but that's all processors since the Pentium Pro which came out in 1995 so it's
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.420]   it's a lot it's a lot and I don't I'm presuming it's just basically for
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:53.280]   ARM and those that don't have such a hairy process of designs but right and
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.560]   nothing needs to be done with the firmware or anything this is no it's
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.800]   operating your op it'll be patched at the operating system well it'll be packed
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.080]   well it'll be patched at the process level if they can patch that that's the
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.520]   other pieces is it now that's the long-term I suspect that's that's really hard
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.320]   yeah yeah that's exactly a plan but they do that you know we've seen
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.680]   processors patched before there but you know it's totally doable but it I'm
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.040]   sure takes a little longer Peter Brights the impact of this will vary
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.080]   depending on workload every time a program makes a call into the kernel to
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.240]   read to the disk from the disk to send data the networked open a file that call
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.200]   be a little more expensive because of this paging that will have to occur
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.480]   programs that don't use the kernel much might see a hit of perhaps two to three
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.960]   percent but workloads that call the kernel a lot will see much greater
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.600]   performance drop off a benchmark a program that does virtually nothing
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.960]   other than call the kernel saw its performance drop by fifty five zero
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.640]   percent each call to the kernel took twice as long so that's not insignificant
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.120]   you know when you look at that then the 30 percent overall doesn't seem
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.400]   unlike you know so seem out of the picture that's a big that's a big hit
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:11.360]   that's a big hit but again you know it's all kind of it's a developing story as
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.640]   they say yeah so we'll keep what we talked about yesterday and security now
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.880]   Steve Gibson you know was very calm and so I didn't I didn't really twig to how
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.080]   serious this could be until I read the register and then I thought oh this this
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   could be a little bit more serious than I thought Steve's always calm right
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.880]   he's good well no no he'll he'll light his hair on fire if need be if need be
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.600]   as of January 1st Google is now blocking YouTube on Amazon devices boys boys
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.840]   boys can't you get along Google says we have a bigger button
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.160]   yeah why should we expect the tech industry to be more more mature than the
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:03.760]   president Google stocks blocking on Amazon fire TV echo show in a new
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.440]   use this is from variety an unusually frank statement of Google spokesperson
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.800]   squarely blamed Amazon's unwilling this to strike a business deal with Google
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.400]   for the step we've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.040]   access to each other's products and services but Amazon doesn't carry Google
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.960]   products like Chromecast and Google Home doesn't make prime video available for
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Google Cast users in last month stop selling some of NASA's latest products
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.160]   given this lack of reciprocity we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.120]   show on fire TV we hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.160]   this is you've been through this the cable cable wars in New Jersey haven't
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.520]   you Jeff where the cable company says well ESPN wants too much money so we're
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.880]   not gonna let you what she is being and it's a kind of a game of chicken of
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.360]   brinksmanship it is and it hurts customers it hurts the brand and in the
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.840]   long run shows that they don't care about the customers enough but it's also I
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.160]   mean it's also self-destructive for them I mean I've you know I've got prime
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.920]   and I've got Netflix I've got a Chromecast that's what I would normally use I've
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.480]   also got a smart TV and I have to use that for the Amazon Play staff but it's a
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.640]   smart TV which means it's flaky so at some point we were watching we're
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.760]   watching some series on Amazon and either Amazon's network flaked out the
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.440]   smart TV software freaked out I don't know what so I had to go and get go and
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.040]   get my Chromebook of video cable plug it into the TV watch it on that and
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:40.160]   faff around for ages because Amazon refuses to support Chromecast from the
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.880]   you know from Android at all so I have to do it with the physical cable and and
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.440]   it's like it makes me want to watch Netflix instead of Amazon which is pretty
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.480]   stupid from Amazon's point of view I would have thought Netflix has been
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.120]   good at we will run everywhere we're very you know because they don't have
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.800]   that is their business whereas Amazon has a strategy tax on on prime video
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.120]   because they actually care more about selling stuff through the store and they
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.080]   did say that they sold more and fire sticks than anything except the echo over
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.520]   Christmas so you know why they're selling fire sticks right I don't know if
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.440]   this is taken over in the UK but it's all the rage in the states people are
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.680]   putting Cody they're hacking the fire sticks putting Cody on it and then using
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.720]   them using the fire sticks to watch pirated TV shows oh no it's massive you
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.040]   go go on eBay go anywhere we were we were hearing about this on a couple of
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.360]   weeks ago when JJ Stone was talking about a friend of his who he was at
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.960]   Great Pains to emphasize was not too bright who would go to the kids softball
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.160]   games and say fire sticks get your get your patched fire sticks here he was
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.880]   selling Amazon fire sticks patched so they could pick up pirate programming and
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.600]   and Amazon's done by the way absolutely nothing to stop this as far as I can
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.720]   tell shouldn't we should mention it's not Cody's fault Cody is a legit platform
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.600]   but there are Cody plugins that let you do this and if if fire stick if Amazon's
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.400]   admitting fire sticks sales were through the roof this Christmas that's as much
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.360]   as admitting because of piracy so it's a very petrofastic to run and
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.840]   Chromecast that might solve my problem well you can run Cody on it KODI right
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.160]   which is the old Xbox media center and it has plugins that let you you know
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.600]   okay watch pirate is so forth well we're in the Caribbean you know I had a
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.840]   skipper because I didn't want to sail this boat myself his name was jelly bean
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   good okay skipper jelly but I got on the boat good oh man I said hi what's your
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.480]   my name is Leo what's your name he said call me jelly bean he was great love
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.800]   jelly bean but he was very interested in a hacked fire stick and I wasn't
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.880]   telling them about it but the kids I was with new all about it and we're saying
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.120]   oh yeah and they said here's how you get it and before we would at the end of
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.440]   the trip before we could leave jelly bean says now don't give me that right down
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:09.880]   here what I should get man for that we're spreading good will to the rest of
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:15.680]   the world by the way boy you know they talk about Puerto Rico and almost 50%
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:23.640]   yeah how about it British Virgin Islands just devastating and and jelly if I'll
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:29.040]   call him as first name jelly had not had been a captain sailing the care
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.240]   being since 1989 and he had intentionally his he lost his roof he was telling us
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.000]   the story of he took his wife and his eight-year-old daughter and they
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.040]   huddled in the bathroom and he's heard this big boom as the roof blew off and
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.360]   then the back door in the front door blew off blew off not just blew open
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.920]   blew off and the refrigerator in the kitchen was blown through the back door
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.600]   and ended up two blocks down the road he's right it's amazing he's a lot but he
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.720]   had not gone around to see the devastation so it was like watching it
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.560]   watching it through his eyes was very much getting a sense of this and it's
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.840]   just flattened flattened I mean we went to an island he says not there anymore
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.760]   it's just it's like it's bizarre truly devastated yeah no no and there's no
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.640]   power I mean nobody's got everybody any restaurant or business we went to was
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.880]   running on a generator and and and you know I mean they're the amazing thing is
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.120]   these people are so spirited and generous they were giving us stuff and I was
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.240]   just I was like what I was blown away it was very and it hardly was anybody
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.080]   there which was I guess it's a kind of a thing it's a problem I was supposed to
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.800]   go to a conference and put Rico on and you know they moved to Miami I just
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.080]   felt bad because there was money that's needed there yeah yeah I was glad I was
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.800]   actually glad we were there and they were very glad to see us but I felt a
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.120]   little I felt they feel a little guilty but I was but they were very glad to see
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.480]   us I think I don't know I got sidetracked sorry about that I've told we do here
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   that's what we do it's the sidetracked show so great article it seems highly
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.280]   speculative in venture B speculating that Apple because of the new tax law
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.880]   might actually be preparing to repeat it well I don't know I mean according to
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.160]   the financial times and I can't read it because it's behind a paywall Tim Cook
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.400]   says Apple to repatriate overseas cash pile next year part of that is the new
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   tax rate under the new tax law of repatriation is 15 and a half percent
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.160]   Tim Cook said we'll do it if you can give us 10 but I guess 15 and a half
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.920]   is enough but that gives them a big pile of US cash and so this article by Jeremy
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:45.800]   Horowitz is about what might they do with that and city analysts pick Netflix
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:53.240]   or Disney as an acquisition target city says Netflix is the most likely partly
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.520]   because it's a lot cheaper but also it's a lot easier to absorb Disney is huge
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   Apple would actually have to need more money they'd have to borrow money to do
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   it and jobs were live by the Disney more out of I think Disney would be a great
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.240]   acquisition yeah jobs and I guess his wife Lorraine is widow with Lorraine was
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.920]   for a long time the largest stockholder of Disney I don't know if they still are
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   because they Disney bought Pixar right and Rob erd Eiger Disney CEO is on
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.760]   Apple's board so there's always been kind of this relationship did Apple
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.120]   would need to spend $262 billion to purchase Disney at a 40% premium over
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.800]   its current enterprise value that's about two to three times more than
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:45.160]   Netflix but wouldn't you rather have Marvel and Star Wars and this theme
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:51.480]   parks and I mean this that could be huge huge for Apple right it's also but it's
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.840]   also a bit of a of a lead weight to in some ways that why go into old media
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.600]   businesses well Horowitz also points out that the that Disney has 195,000
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.400]   employees that's more than Apple yeah that's a that's a big apple to bite
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   so I don't hear they'd ruin I think if you're Apple would ruin Netflix you
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.600]   I mean Apple wants a content but they're not willing I mean they're so far
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.000]   they won't spend a billion dollars to make content this year but along you know
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.200]   seven billion or whatever Netflix suspended Netflix is doing eight eight right eight
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.280]   but boy you just all you do is spend a couple hundred billion on a Disney and
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.240]   you're set for life yeah plus it's a profitable enterprise you know of the
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.360]   top nine box office movies of all time three are the last three Star Wars movies
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.800]   Jesus you also got Hulu by the way if you buy this you get Hulu because of the
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.320]   Murdoch the Fox acquisition that'd be an interesting I you know from our point
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.960]   of view we're rooting for you know the big news story that would be when we
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.520]   could we could dine out on for a few weeks so anyway we'll keep an eye on that one
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.240]   and frankly it's still not I'm still not sure that they're going to repatriate
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.000]   their money meanwhile Google moved 19.2 billion dollars to Bermuda
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.920]   uh 16 billion euros
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.080]   uh in 2016 this is according to regulatory filings and then the Netherlands this is
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.280]   the Dutch sandwich we've heard so much about tasty
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:30.600]   the double Irish just like Apple Google uses the double Irish and the Dutch sandwich
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.240]   to shield the majority of its international profits from taxation one of the things I don't know
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.200]   one of the things Apple does I don't know if Google does this but Apple is very active about
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   this they actually transfer intellectual property rights to Ireland so that they have to pay a
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.240]   license fee uh take American profits sent into Ireland thereby avoiding the tax in America and
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.960]   paying the very low Irish corporate tax uh I don't know if Google's doing that
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:04.760]   not but but what happens is uh you shift revenue from an Irish this is what Google's doing
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.640]   shift revenue from an Irish subsidiary to a Dutch company with no employees and then on to
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:17.480]   a Bermuda mailbox owned by another Irish company seven percent more in 2016 than the year before
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:23.880]   be interesting again you know all these companies Facebook does it Google does it Apple
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.160]   does it lots of companies do it they all say look it's the tax law we're just doing what's legal
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:35.800]   to we comply with the tax laws of every country and we're doing what's legal but we also have you
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:42.600]   know a responsibility to pay as little taxes we legally have to we wouldn't expect us to pay
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.480]   more would you although Facebook didn't Facebook say that we're gonna stop doing that we're gonna
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:56.920]   pay more taxes in the US what did you find Ireland um charged after tax yes that's right and he and
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.440]   this happened to go that was over Apple this has happened to Google too last year Google
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.400]   uh escaped a 1.12 billion euro french tax bill after court ruled its Irish subsidiary which
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.080]   collects revenue for ads the company sells in France there's no permanent base in the country
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.160]   and the EU is exploring ways to make them pay but this is all up to those governments
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.040]   to negotiate right it's not up to the companies to decide you know where to pay there they have a
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.480]   fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to reduce taxes and increase profit and and the
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.600]   companies the countries are competing with each other and they should do something about this it
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.400]   is unfair i agree but it's not up to the companies to decide this is up to the governments yeah that's
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.920]   their job well the Irish tax corporate tax rate now is 12 and a half percent uh the new tax bill
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.040]   says corporate tax rate in the US is now down to 21 percent i don't know if that's low enough
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   that people will consider repatriating their what they want to do with it google say they're not
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.200]   gonna do it for the principal they're gonna do it if they if they have something they want to buy
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.400]   or something they want to do here according to bloomburg uh google would have saved 3.7 billion
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:11.320]   dollars in taxes uh in 2016 doing that uh in that tax transfer but they hold 60 billion dollars overseas
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.880]   anyway i think that the new tax bill might change that we'll see
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.360]   plus i think i mean this what had happened sorry another thing is this is you're saying
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:30.840]   they're they're they're required to the shareholders i mean this is charlie strosis um thing about we
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:40.040]   have malevolent ais in their corporations um he gave he gave a speech at um c4 this week um i
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.800]   i was sticking in the chat or whatever but um basically his it's it's about he wrote a thing
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:52.200]   called invaders from mars a few years ago which said uh we have we did this strange thing sometime
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   in the 18th century where we said that um we can have non-human entities that we treat as humans
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:04.760]   they're called corporations um and they have this weird ability to uh be immortal and transfer
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.160]   assets between themselves and move between countries um and now they're at the point where
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   they're taking over the laws and rewriting the laws to suit them um so
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.640]   all the people fretting about ais taking over uh of sort of missing the wood for the trees because
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.760]   actually we have these um sort of very slow moving ais that are actually artificial um
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:33.320]   artificial beings that are um distorting everything in the world because they they behave this way
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   it's a charlie strosis a sci-fi author uh it seems to be taking uh niel steve was it niel steve
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.280]   stevinson's mantle he used to go do those crazy speeches at south by uh this is apparently going
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.760]   to be it now it's going to be charlie strosis in this talk and i it was um busterally bros sterling
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.840]   that's right all right in this talk charl stros will give a rambling discursive and angry tour
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.640]   of what went wrong with the 21st century why we didn't see it coming where we could expect to go
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.280]   next in a few suggestions for what to do about it if we don't like it it's his keynote at the
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.400]   three fourth chaos communication congress it's not easy to read it then to watch it because he's
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.840]   he's a writer rather performer but right it's um at all so he can put links in the in the in the
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:21.800]   in the post but his you know this is his basic thesis is that um Elon Musk is worried about
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.680]   ai taking over and he's ignoring the fact that he's he runs three ais of his own that are doing
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.840]   strange things to the world as well um so he talks about you know the idea of the paper
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.920]   paper clip maximizer is the thing that people are scared of about ais that they'll set an
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.320]   ai going whose job is to make paper clips and not turn everything over to paper by the way is an
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:45.720]   awesome game i highly recommend honest i spent several days making paper clips
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:52.760]   but but he says you know tesla is a battery maximizer it's its whole goal is to make more
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.040]   batteries and turn turn everything into batteries oh interesting so it's like the paper clip
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:08.680]   yeah and and you know his point is that companies have um you know overt goals and
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.320]   notional controls but their instrumental goals is maximizing revenue and they'll do as as
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.720]   jeff was saying they will do things to do that whatever the consequences for everyone else
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.800]   so they will do that even if it means all their money is somehow in Bermuda rather than paying
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.520]   taxes where they should right you know where the taxes are designed to be and
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.720]   and yeah i don't think they get a pass for saying well we just we've we just found a way to hack
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   the laws to to do this because you know they're obviously skirting if they are actually generating
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   if they're you know they're not really generating the revenue um for intellectual property in
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.760]   Bermuda they're genuinely the revenue by selling advertising services in in populated countries
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.680]   that actually have tax now you got me making paper clips
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:58.600]   this is Nick Nick Bostrom's uh you know kind of thought experiment about what happens
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.560]   if you create an AI that's optimized to make paper clips and nothing else will it eventually
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.560]   and i by the way i proved it turns into all the matter in the universe into paper clips
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.800]   and i got there i did it but the good news at the end of that well i don't want no spoilers but at
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.400]   the end of that game you get a you get an option to continue on let's put that away
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.920]   um well what are we going to do i mean this is uh this is a late stage capitalism this is uh this
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.600]   is where we have brought ourselves well that's you know that's the this is the point it's very hard
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.760]   to know how to fix this because they you know they they tend to adjust legislation to suit them
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.040]   as well to yeah they have so much power now they bought congress and then and so there's nothing
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.480]   we can do about it and you know what we get is them fighting over fighting over the different
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.240]   laws that would benefit different companies and of course part of that was just the citizens united
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:57.640]   decision by the supreme court that said corporations can donate unlimited funds to political campaigns
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:06.040]   yep yep i pretty much sealed the deal yep speaking of sealing the deal uh logan paul god
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:15.240]   dang it this is the uh youtube the um i gotta say the um uh nihilistic youtube star
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.960]   who is you know i mean he and his brother have done things like burn mattresses in the swimming
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.600]   pool of their Beverly Hills home uh to generate youtube views they kind of they took the cake on
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:33.240]   this one they uh he was in the famous suicide forest in japan and posted a video of uh of a
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.840]   suicide uh which i won't show of course in fact it's he took it down after three days and six
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:47.480]   point seven million views but uh you know i think the point is clear here a you as some have pointed
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:55.160]   out no ai is going to be able to find that video and block it and there is an intense race now to
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.960]   become the next most extreme thing you saw it last through with pewdiepie and his racist stuff let me
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:10.600]   let me try to find some good news in this which is uh that our norms uh survived this that that
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:17.640]   he was roundly condemned at all quarters pewdiepie yeah paul god both in logan vlogas were yeah and and
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:23.320]   might have ruined his chances to make money that's up to to youtube i think they should ruin it and um
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.680]   so you know there there are limits and that's what we're setting it's what we're negotiating it's
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:34.200]   we're trying to figure out uh that can we automate those limits uh that's that's hard at scale
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:40.520]   the scale where we are is very hard but but norms one civil civilization one civilization didn't say
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:46.360]   oh okay what's the big deal it's a video no civilization said f u right paul right and made it make it
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:53.160]   down but i think you'll uh have long-term harm or maybe it would in fact help build his brand
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.240]   well that's that's say with pewdiepie that's up to and great measure the platforms whether they
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.800]   choose to have their brands associated with the likes of this if i were a brand i would say no
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:09.560]   you know one strike you're out no um pewdiepie is still on youtube all they did was they took
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.440]   them off of their vip advertising program which did cost him millions of dollars at ad revenue you
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:22.680]   he only made 15 million last year yes i just feel like there's such a there's such pressure it's
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:30.120]   like link bait uh and when it was mainstream media uh i think there were you know societal
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.080]   restraints that kept them from going too crazy i mean we they went crazy enough with reality tv
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:42.360]   and stuff but i feel like on youtube first of all it happened so fast that and it's like the issue
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.080]   yeah it happened so fast that it's i mean three days he gets 6.7 million views those views cannot
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.120]   be taken back i don't know how many kids saw i don't know how many kids were damaged by it or
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.640]   upset by it uh well the other question there is is how long did it take people to report this
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.280]   that's that's to me the most extremely part then the second is how long it take youtube to react
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.600]   apparently they it was reported some say it was reported and youtube did not react and that's
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.520]   youtube that's not bad on youtube you know if it's if it's ramping up that fast it would probably be
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.160]   in the top you know fraction of a percent of videos on youtube and so therefore it should be on
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.840]   ro to review q quickly right you know youtube yeah youtube has a lot of videos and you can't review
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.440]   them all we know that but it should be to review the ones that are ramping up the trending trending
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:33.640]   well you both have teenage teenage sons as as our young sons as i do in the in it my
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   henry's 23 still just you know no no they're not teenagers more but 21 and 22 yeah and same jake
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.800]   is about that age 25 25 so i'm on the boat with these kids and i'm watching the videos they like
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.200]   and they have a very extreme and they've developed a very extreme taste for videos on youtube that's
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   this is pushed them to a more extreme taste and the stuff they watch is and they were telling me
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.000]   about the people they like they they watch a guy who eats hot peppers hot as pepper possible when
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.400]   you watch him in agony as he's eating this pepper they love that they laugh they howl uh there's some
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.880]   other guy who is just completely uh an anarchist he uh has a beautiful set starts a show before he
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.720]   gets his first guest on he destroys the set uh and and then that and then does the show and
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.960]   there's this appetite for more and more extreme stuff and the and the kids eat it up they love it
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.560]   that's what they want and then of course when they try to watch something like this it's like well
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.120]   did nothing happens you didn't you didn't blow anything up what's going on but even david
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:35.160]   letterman back of the day threw things off the roof yeah you know and i have my best respect for
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.480]   him but yeah he was he was in essence doing the baby version of the same thing yeah but i just
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.360]   saying that mainstream media because they were run i'm not praising mainstream media by any
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.960]   means right but because they were run by big corporations like general electric they had a
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:53.160]   reputation to maintain there was always a little bit of a lid on this uh i i mean obviously google
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.880]   and youtube's are big corporations who have a reputation to maintain but i don't i don't know i
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.640]   mean i feel i feel like there's such incentive to get more and more extreme i don't see it going
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.800]   the other way i don't see it coming down on a issue of scale so it's it's it's it's that case on
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.560]   youtube of of the ridiculous videos yeah that they're figured out how to how to manipulate the system
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:22.680]   right yeah uh well the stuff um like uh synthesized um kids cartoon videos right generally
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:29.160]   talking about that yep that that stuff is is creepy there's there's a sort of and this is in jolly's
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.280]   talk as well there's people are now starting to throw weird um you know weird AI machinery at
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.200]   these things to try and makes make stuff up that's that's more convincing right um but also they're
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.960]   attacking it's attacking multiple levels it is this weird thing of they're what they're actually
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.440]   trying to do is game other computers so it's sort of adversarial AI fighting AI they're they're
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   trying to game the ranking other in in in youtube they're trying to game the censorship algorithm in
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:00.120]   youtube as well trying to do something that looks enough like um the things that that should be
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.720]   let through um but will will follow the ranking algorithms and therefore generate ad revenue i
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.920]   feel like sort of it's very very strange nick boston was kind of sort of right but it's instead
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:16.680]   of paperclips it's the forechanting of the world the entire world is just going to turn into forechan
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:24.280]   but how could this what i'm going to go back to my good news thing um there was also a study out
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.200]   this week that said that you know all of the talk about fake news in my world and you know i've
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.760]   got money to deal with it said you know the impact is actually very small oh i hope that's true i
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.360]   hope that's true and other study and other studies are both on the rundown said that um
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:46.120]   let's see if i got this one straight this one said that when i'm not picking on trump in this case
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.960]   or trump voters in this case but when trump voters trump fans were exposed to stories about the russian
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.600]   um connections uh their opinion of trump and trust in him decreased which is to say that news has
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.800]   an impact on people um you put the two together and and there is an opportunity for a flight to
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.560]   quality here there is an opportunity for us to negotiate our norms for an improved society
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.360]   you know you're going to hear my spiel for the hundredth time it's early days 1479 gudenberg
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.720]   years we're figuring this out we're smart as a civilization we will figure it out society's not
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:27.000]   in the dumper quite yet okay but i hope you're right that's all i can say
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.760]   but the challenge is building you know the problem is it's it's the same as the corporate
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:38.040]   text thing we have these twisted incentives that have been um powered through by both real
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.480]   ais and these sort of synthetic slow moving ais that are corporations that maximize the wrong
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   things that really care about it until you till we find a way to go and beat them up and the
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.600]   challenge is how do we find the way to reincentivize them to do things that would actually be
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:58.680]   be useful um when in what levels do we have would could because they're the ones who are
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.520]   gaming our attention i am seeing i mean i am seeing a and it's it's partly a sort of beginning
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.000]   of the year thing but i am seeing a a number of people saying okay that's it i'm switching
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.480]   off facebook and twitter and i'm going to go and do something else you know the the cio of twitter
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:19.800]   spent two days of the argument sorry kennedy put it in punchline there you read too much of the
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.560]   guardian oh come on people are switching i think you're our people switching i read i
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:31.240]   this is things people are saying in in you know in in conversation groups and well i'll give you my
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.720]   son and his friend we i was with two 23 year olds they don't use facebook they barely use it they
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.760]   use snapchat like crazy all the time and i said but wait a minute all these videos and stuff you're
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.280]   sitting back of the vacation they're going to be gone forever they said yeah we don't care
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:53.080]   i don't i gave up facebook is the new i only watch pbs all right
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:59.000]   no but the the balance is that they stop using facebook they use facebook as as linked in they
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.600]   don't use it as yes they're on facebook but they don't spend time on it they they use it as linked
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.880]   in they use it as a way to get people's addresses and stuff as a fun book yeah yeah so but also as
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:17.400]   a way to perform your public persona rather than your private conversations so uh last night uh uh
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.240]   uh the president got in a twitter war with kim jong hoon
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:27.240]   uh trump tweeted north korean leader king john ohne has just stated the nuclear button is on his
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.400]   desk at all times will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him i too
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:40.040]   have a nuclear button but it is much bigger and more powerful one than his and my button works
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:50.280]   uh immediately people went in fact somebody uh put uh up uh projected up on the side of the
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:59.080]   building at twitter headquarters hashtag uh jackie or at jackie's hashtag complicit um
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.720]   immediately people said well wait a minute it aren't those death threats doesn't that
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:09.320]   isn't that violating uh twitter's uh rules shouldn't the president be banned and then i saw
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.080]   another tweet that said anybody who thinks twitter is ever going to brand the president the united
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:21.160]   states from twitter is not paying is not playing with a full deck so so we've said two things on that
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:26.520]   i mean what is this michael wolf stuff that that's kind of this come out i think it's just been
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.360]   published yes i don't know what time it is there yeah where so he's basically big biker wolf is a
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.200]   kind of sleazy journalist guy who's very good at schmoozing and apparently just schmooze is
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.480]   going to the white house and um chatted to everyone and has now written down everything that he said
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.720]   to him and has published it um and it's you know this is this is the banan comments right
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.400]   no no there's so many more than that always more than that it's his book katie tour just put up one
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:59.000]   where where uh she she had the book and marked it and said that his goal was to get his friends
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:09.080]   um wives in bed uh there's a whole kind who's goal trump's trumps so so let me just ask a
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:14.600]   couple questions because of course this is all over the news uh right now um uh because trump
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.760]   read it and then said well ban i banan really didn't work for me or something he has nothing to do
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.120]   with his presidency uh barely there were no campaign managers on the trump campaign at all
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   because uh anyway uh is wolf to be trusted or is he making stuff up wolf has a mixed reputation
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:40.440]   but he does get access making access journalists nervous uh he recreates entire conversations i read
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.320]   i read there's a new york magazine has it has the longest longest excerpt out there and a huge
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.400]   conversation between banan and previous this kind of stuff and who knows what he got where uh do
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.600]   you take him on this is the equivalent of the trump dossier well what he says what he says in the
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:02.680]   piece is that and the the leaking is trump himself because what trump does is phone up people and
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.400]   complain about them to other people and vote back and forth and so he just worked out who was
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.680]   phoning and talk to them and because he's trump isn't very good at saying on the record off the record
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.400]   he was able to go and listen to them and hold people light and pay attention and
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.720]   and then write down what they said and then triangulate it across different people who was he
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:27.320]   working for when he did this and the new york magazine or no he's doing a book so he's just
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.520]   wandered in and said i'm writing a book and a near a near permanent position on the couch in the
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:39.000]   west wing what and that he could go hang out oh my god this is wolf wolf also did wolf
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.520]   uh went to the first four square conference and it was all off the record very clear he just
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.840]   violated the heck out of that he usually broke the twilight of the of the moguls out of that
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.960]   then somehow he got access to mordach did a book on mordach mordach wasn't happy then he did his
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.840]   gossip columns for the likes of vanity fair and and such and this is michael he does this he's a
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:07.480]   good writer um he's uh uh snarky and um you know you there's no attribution he's recreating dialogue
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.680]   you know who knows um but it's going to be provocative as hell it's going to be out there like
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.760]   crazy or the next five new cycles are going to be all this and then trump's going to react as he
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.840]   already has so he's he's now accusing bannon of being insane we live in a reality show this is
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.680]   now all reality reality is just what the new york times said that's why riz having to fit
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   about the new york timesane oh isn't that cute he turned the presidency in a reality show as if
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:36.440]   that was a positive there's nothing cute about it but it's clear that uh so this is a book uh that's
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:59.400]   going to come out and be a huge bestseller because i'm just reading the nw
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.640]   right which we always presume was his strategy he says i don't think about losing it isn't losing
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:12.680]   we've totally won even before he won and then he won it was oh whoa but at this point he's got
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:23.560]   nothing to lose nope so don't you told a friend that trump looked as if he had seen a ghost
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:33.160]   millennia was in tears and not of joy oh my god this is my favorite quote so and the trump
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:39.800]   response about about bannon yeah in there was this line winning isn't as easy as i make it look
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:50.440]   isn't that the ultimate trump one wow okay okay wow so he is a easy reality tv of personess he
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   he is a media hack that's what he's been doing for the last you know 30 years
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:04.280]   leveraging media attention into money and you know deals and using that to shut people up
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:12.200]   lake off george lake off the the linguist and political analyst
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.640]   read a long sort of thread onto it so basically you're saying
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.800]   the more time we spend talking about this stuff the more we're playing into his narrative because
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:29.320]   he thrives on attention and he likes being a reality tv star and he likes talking about ratings
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.360]   and all this stuff and he says you know you've got you've got to reframe it so that you're talking
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.920]   when he says something outrageous and wrong first you're rebutted and then you say oh and by the way
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:46.360]   the trump said his usual nonsense and so we had jones darvin on and that was really great a couple
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:52.760]   weeks ago and she basically talked about the fact that that memes won the election
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:50:00.920]   and and that what what we have isn't even it isn't even really the reality show presidency
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.000]   it is the it is it is the reddit presidency it's the fourth gen press the meme
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.520]   driven presidency and and but you think so to get back into the the conversation you started jeff
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:18.120]   you think that there are signs that this is that this is going to go away and everything's going
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:24.520]   to be fine you know i would even i would go that but okay i feel like we've gone down the rabbit hole
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.160]   and it's going to be pretty yeah it's going to be pretty darn it for one thing
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:35.640]   it's very engaging the rate the ratings as mr trump would say are through the roof
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:43.640]   yeah we've got to accept i think my problem is this we have i just read a um uh uh
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.320]   what's the conservative magazine uh t ro uh uh uh uh new republic new republic tinar
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:55.400]   tinar um that's the conservative one i always get to refuse no national reviews the
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.480]   conservative one new republic is the whatever more nor under accurate to do it over in national
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.840]   review i'm sorry i know national review yeah um so national review and wrote a piece just say
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.680]   it's about institutions there's no trust and no faith in institutions but he certainly more
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:13.480]   and and that's where we are that's that's troubling because it's the it
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.840]   it's it's become very clear to me and we talked we talked about this before as well that really
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:25.960]   all of this is made up it's like it's like currency it's like money without a faith in in you know a
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:31.640]   belief in our institutions a belief that they work a belief in the rule of law you really you
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.280]   have nothing there's no it's all made up it's all it's all a con social contract right
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.800]   exactly it is i'm rereading uh i'm thinking a lot about this notion of after the mass and and i
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.360]   wrote a piece about that last week and i'm doing a lot more research in this order to hold pile of
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:51.960]   books about it and and and yeah i think that what we see is a constant desire to return to the
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.400]   institutions we have i think we better accept the relevant we have and figure out how to redesign
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.920]   things around that and and the reality we have now is that it's not Walter Cronkite land and
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:06.760]   Walter Cronkite was a myth himself that the shared reality was a myth um that uh i don't
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:12.680]   aspire to be left with yes yeah and and you know believe in the myth and you get in this very
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:20.360]   dystopian state where where anything goes that you know do what thou wilt is the whole of the law
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   that's that's kind of where but that's the here's the question is that it does the need
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.440]   to go too far do we have it this is my point about can it swim back you know that the the
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:35.320]   suicide video in the Japanese woods was okay that's enough okay we found a limit there it is
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.920]   that's enough boom push back uh and and and we push back a society or we're going to push back
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   on the platform so are we willing to have them do this i mean the same time of course Germany
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   has done this another story on the rundown where of course they have a law they're going to charge
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.000]   billions of dollars if you leave any fake news or bad stuff up so what's happening
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.040]   satirists are getting taken down off of twitter um you know what's the line what's the limit
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:03.000]   we're we're negotiating this now but i think we're clearly in a place where we're saying to the
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.080]   platforms um open is not good enough no we we do want you to do some effort work on this and we're
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.000]   going to give you the license to do that um you could do it Germany's way which we're going to
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.840]   charge you a fortune to make you scared and take down all kinds of stuff including satire of bad
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:22.040]   actors or we can do it through self-regulation but i think there's an opportunity for a flight to
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:27.080]   quality that's my point and i think it's i think it's this whole fake news thing has a desire that
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:32.200]   advertisers are being pushed to stop supporting this junk the platforms are being pushed to stop
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.960]   promoting the junk um does that end up do we as a society and up someplace better off it's hard to
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:43.400]   say that we approve when we have the likes of what we have happening in Washington um you know it
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:52.280]   does the does it go too far or not we'll see and then there's this a twitter user with a handle
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:54:01.000]   swatistic swa utist i see threatened to swat that is call the tactical squad the police on another

[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:07.160]   say saying he could see on tv the police had fallen for his attack his swat and he said uh i didn't
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:13.240]   get anyone killed because i didn't pull the trigger uh by the way police in los angeles have
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:20.280]   arrested they believe the man responsible 25 year old in connection with that attack the argument
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.160]   who's born at fault well they're both at fault it was also it was reason magazine said exactly
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.760]   that they're both at fault they're both at fault uh the police are fault in the game where it's
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:34.120]   throw the book at the throw the book at swa utistic if that's who if that's if they've got him and uh
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.680]   absolutely the police need to be aware of the fact that swatting happens i've we've been swa
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.720]   we had the police petaluma police come to the lee oh yeah a couple of years ago that's what we
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.440]   have an armed guard petaluma police came to uh our i didn't talk about it at the time because i
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:56.280]   didn't want to encourage it came to our front door but they the game come with weapons drawn
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.480]   and and uh and a battering ram uh they kind of understood that they're there you know there's
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.520]   some risk here we immediately diffuse the situation uh but i did hear the recording the guy said
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.160]   i'm gonna kill everybody at twit and then i'm gonna set off bombs and blow up the whole place
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:15.880]   and i've already killed three people inside or whatever i mean you know he was a you know
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:23.480]   so this happens all the time but here's here's the thing this is this goes back again to the
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:29.240]   what's the same erin paul no um erin paul by the way who's been really good on twitter uh
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:34.360]   taken down all of these people look at the actor erin paul no uh what what the god's name
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.960]   logan paul logan paul so the logan paul video is is is the problem we have to is people people
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:45.880]   use that and say ah society's fallen apart you can't if you extrapolate only from an anecdote like that
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:52.120]   from one schmuck like that that you don't arrive at an accurate view it's the same problem with
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.920]   press coverage right now of the base when the majority of the country they don't cover and talk
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:04.280]   to at all um you know the extrapolation from the anecdote is to free your problem and how
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.320]   we judge society and what we choose to do about i agree
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:12.520]   although we know this happens and i'm i'm quoting from brian Krebs article he's been
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:19.960]   swatted too quebzun security he was swatted in 2313 and there are there are more swaddings
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.240]   going on all the time i hate i don't even want to talk about it because i'm afraid of getting
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:29.000]   swatted again yeah yeah you don't want to do that now let's find something happier all right the
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:41.800]   dystopia report continues uh let's see new bill i you know it's a bill and as as i remember a bill
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:49.160]   is not a law the new bill which is uh the right bill could finally get rid of these uh paperless
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:54.440]   voting machine six senators bipartisan group introduced legislation called the secure elections
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:58:00.200]   act it aims to eliminate these paperless voting machines we've been talking about promoting
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:05.000]   routine audits that would dramatically reduce the danger of hacking including interference
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.680]   from foreign governments uh Kamala Harris our senator from california uh james lankford
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:19.480]   republican from oklahoma uh the arse technica writes this the bill reads like a computer security
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:27.320]   experts wish list so uh let's hope let's hope see there's hope let's hope that the
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:32.200]   congress realizes how you know i gotta guess when everybody was going crazy in tech land about
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:38.920]   about the voting machines i cut out paren noio tin foil hats i was wrong absolutely wrong we've
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:43.320]   got it if we secure nothing else we've got to secure that and by the way the census to coming up
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.120]   which there's a lot of efforts to go after that these are these are the fundamental institutions
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:53.480]   of a democracy and they're being threatened so yes we've got to go overboard to protect them
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:59.240]   uh lance norton an election expert from nyu says the most important thing about the bill is
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:06.520]   who's sponsoring at the bill has three republican cosponsors three democrats uh so this uh this has
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:13.880]   a shot i uh now um we should point out we we talked a lot about election fraud and voter machine
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:18.680]   hacking before the election last year uh and the experts we had only did a great triangulation on
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:24.040]   it the consensus was well yeah there are problems but because we have such a heterogeneous system in
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:28.760]   the united states every not every state every county even has different systems it'd be very
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:33.880]   hard to do any mass hacking that would affect the vote but now in hindsight what we realize is
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   because of the electoral college and the and the closeness of the votes in general it only took
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:48.360]   40,000 votes and that that wouldn't be a lot of votes to swing uh if not all so i think this is
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:54.200]   really important and uh yeah i think we i think we get to a point where an elections validity is
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.720]   legitimately called into question and then what happened that's that's the answer then what do you
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:06.200]   do then what do you do you know what if we don't have a we don't have a constant we like you we
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.760]   don't have a constitution that looks like gumbee we change it all the time which is your flexibility
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.720]   you have kevin we have this thing that's set in ink and then yeah you guys are set because if you
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.840]   you can have elections any old time all you have to have is a vote of no confidence and boom you get
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:27.560]   to do it over you get to do over yep exactly for the parliamentary system frankly it is
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.920]   well but also you know the voting system here is we have bits of paper that we put x's and boxes
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.520]   oh very good i want to go back to the one where you dip your thumb in ink
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.480]   but no but the i mean the open rights group that i'm involved with here
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.560]   spent a long time campaigning against moving to electronic voting here because there was a
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:51.000]   war we can people can vote on mine it's like no they can't not reliably not there is no way to do this
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.440]   um and we you know we won the argument the last time but it's coming around again and now it's like
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:04.600]   with but with blockchain no that's that that's but with blockchain anything but with blockchain
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:14.040]   decentralized network but the point is you know the point is bits of paper in boxes that you then
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.280]   split into the piles and measure the height of the piles is actually a fairly good system
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   and it's quite hard to hack it it involves everything's around with trucks okay you can
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.600]   hack it by um stealing a bunch of ballots and replacing another bunch of ballots so you have to
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:37.000]   write watch that most hard work it's hard to do from Russia yes CNBC says Amazon is in discussions
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.440]   with consumer brands about oh no ads on the echo proctor and gambled for ox well it was inevitable
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:56.920]   wasn't it what would they be like apparently there there are some tests going on so um the
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.280]   the report says there may be a range of promotional opportunities on the echo one is reportedly a
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:08.040]   product suggestion on behalf of a brand tied to purchase history echo may suggest to a shopper
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:15.720]   who previously bought chloroxes pine salt to consider buying its disinfecting wipes i see you've
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   bought pine salt perhaps you'd be interested in these disinfecting wipes or if you say echo how do
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.760]   i get red wine out of a carpet you might say shout it out
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   um echo i'd like to buy some paper towels currently if you say echo i'd like to buy some paper towels
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:45.000]   people say it will say okay i can look for a brand like bounty what would you like so maybe there
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.760]   maybe this is already happening yeah well it's going to happen with media too you know um
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.080]   play me frank sonatra wouldn't you prefer Tony Bennett
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:59.320]   oh i hope that we do that i mean that's you know i want to move with Katherine Hepburn sorry we
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:09.240]   don't have any you know many people like Katherine Hepburn also like i'm going to show who i would
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:18.120]   Aaron Paul i don't know i literally did that i searched i was i was trying to find i can
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   run the film now this is this time last year i searched netflix with Katherine Hepburn movies and
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.960]   they had one that's that's sad it was desk set which is a good movie in this one i can see when
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:35.000]   they kept that one but they had one Katherine Hepburn movie one oh you won't part of them so
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.400]   how do you there's no ad blocker that can block ads coming from your amazon echo that's your
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:47.000]   you're stuck listening to that ad yeah well i just don't have an emuson okay so i'm safe there i
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.600]   suppose but i'm sure my phone will wake up and stop offering me things so apparently i would
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.000]   ask whether it just kills advertising yeah this is just not feasible you just can't do it any
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   form it's going to work yeah well i mean you know you'd have to you know well i don't think i'm
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.760]   just gonna do it in a form that google could because google really knows how to do this google
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.160]   is already in the business or that's a good plan understanding when you're searching for something
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.200]   that is like to be a purchase and that's when they give you ads so if i search for Katherine Hepburn
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.480]   they won't try and sell me air freshener or something but if i if i search for air freshener
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.280]   the top row of things will be ways to buy it because they understand that's it this i'm surprised
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:40.120]   according to amazon's financials amazon made did ad sales of one billion dollars in q3 wow
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.040]   so amazon is not completely not in the ad business no of course because well they're in
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:52.440]   the they're in this weird ad business because they do retargeting so because they understand
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:58.840]   your purchase they can give you a by a by an alink so you know by my sons working for a game company
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.440]   and we're physical a physical game company so that they're selling physical objects through amazon
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:11.720]   and so a lot of the a lot of the stuff that works for them is ads that generate those those
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.520]   things and the point is once you've created an impression there amazon will retarget you until
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.880]   you buy it you know i searched for an instant pot yesterday and apparently you can't buy them
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.560]   in the UK and the price of amazon was 650 pounds wow because they've got all the stocks that
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:35.000]   stocks sold out over christmas you can't buy an instant pot in the UK nope is that why they don't
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   sell me you know oh they're sold out so i'm going to recommend the breville fast slow cooker which
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.440]   is better than an instant pot in my opinion but okay uh that's what i have it ran a search
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:56.200]   a search for instant pot and i and it was like instant pot uh 650 that's crazy because it's called
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:04.120]   surge pricing 6r 1948 39 which is like what a point of these things that they were cheap
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:10.360]   as well as good pressure i can get you one uh for 5898 overnight by amazon prime
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:16.920]   but can it ship to the UK oh it's a big way it's like a lot you know actually the actual
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.720]   that's that's a uh that's a crock pot a good knockoff of the insta by the actual instant pots
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.600]   are a little more pricey i thought they were cheap too yeah they're over a hundred bucks
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.840]   no no they're they they became a premium brand in the last two months oh that's so funny
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.400]   but but the point i was making was i did that search and it was like because we wanted to buy
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.200]   my son one it's like well that's kind of crazy and then every time i browse the web today i see
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.000]   insta pot 60 pounds wow oh oh that's what you're oh i see what you're seeing
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.480]   the retargeting is that's that's the so the ad revenue they're getting is
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.360]   for that kind of ad insertions that they put everywhere right i get it
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.400]   that's interesting so i don't it's not it's not an elixir but also you know they have the
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.440]   other half of your ad thing they have they can actually complete the sale and credits where it
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.080]   came from because they put inject the ads into the page and if you're a large media organization
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.920]   and you inject those kinds of ads then you can you can get the i'm not sure you say what it is but
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   you can't it's like getting the amazon referral fee but a bit lower right billion dollars a quarter
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:35.160]   ain't bad yeah but that's yeah i'm quite sure how that works that that may be some
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.640]   accounting trick as well yeah because because i'm assuming they're actually paying the the
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.840]   sites they're injecting ads into
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.720]   uh
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:52.600]   what time do you want to get out of here jeff oh six fifteen ish pretty soon 20 minutes from now
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:58.360]   yeah okay let's see well what else what else should there's so many stories i can get out of the
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:06.840]   dystopia vein if we could play oh it's amazing the tesla is the most popular auto maker in Norway
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   yeah because they have to go all electric by 2020 don't they that's phenomenal yeah i got a nice
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.200]   deal i don't know who it was if you're watching thank you somebody put my name down as a referral
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:28.200]   for a tesla and they took delivery and tesla sent me he said hey thank you you can get and i i said
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:34.040]   okay i'll take it one of those little kids tesla's that you drive around well i want to see you drive
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.960]   i'm getting a mini tesla free you're kidding me oh
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:46.280]   it's like wow anybody who's watching why am i a tesla make sure you mention me i can have a whole
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:53.080]   fleet of mini teslas driving all around town actually that's something we're going to do when we
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.200]   go to we're going to japan in the spring the hot thing in japan now i know it's in tokyo nousaka
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.960]   is mario kart that you put on a mario costume it's a tour of tokyo and they give you a little
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.560]   mario kart and you drive around town a little mario kart's and mario costumes
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.720]   that's i'm going to do that i'm doing that oh lord
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:19.720]   for example each other yeah yeah you know it explains it because i was seeing um all of these
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:25.960]   videos of people driving around tokyo and mario karts and i i couldn't quite figure out why i was
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.000]   seeing all of these and now i know here i let's turn off the sound on this but this is uh this
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.400]   is a big thing now people people do these tours of tokyo how is that legal how well you've seen
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.600]   all these weird things people drive around in san francisco right the little i know yeah i guess
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.640]   it's all for tourism mario kart dot com
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:10:00.760]   i can't wait i love i love i love japan i can't wait it's gonna be
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:08.040]   so much fun uh it's better than driving around a segue because you really look
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.200]   dopey in the segue that's true that's true it's amazing they're still out there yeah
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:20.360]   um so i've two related stories say that that two two things artificial intelligence can look
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:27.800]   at a picture of you and tell whether you're sick or a republican or both are both so uh
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.600]   is this joint sense no they're not related they're just two different stories that was a line too
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:40.040]   easy don't get rid of these two easy i i set you up i set you up um so it's a analysis of images
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:47.080]   that uh are you know now we're getting some of the benefit of this for instance it can it can
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.320]   how do you vote they can look at your image and tell you based on 50 million images and location
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.440]   data uh how you're likely to vote and then i saw one this morning that said they could tell if
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:04.680]   you're sick by looking at you mmm i'm suspicious of these correlation things it's like okay
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.120]   hey is there anything it can't do i'm just trying to find happy stories
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:17.800]   i also saw that that i put up on the rundown that that theory that with facebook and phone records
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.760]   you could find people who are more connected to people and if you inoculate them against the disease
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:29.000]   uh i don't know i look for uh that that's gonna that's gonna be our privacy stuff like crazy but
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.960]   but it's an example of how data can do that's awesome that's awesome yeah yeah i think four
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.640]   square and or google tracking would be better than facebook because people have lots of friends
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:48.840]   of facebook may not get out much facebook is ditching the false news flag i was curious what
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.600]   you would say about this one jeff well we've been we've been people in this fake disworld have been
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:00.680]   trying to get data from facebook and they have not ever uh delivered but what was the impact of the
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:07.560]   flag um and clearly they're saying that this was not doing the job maybe no it made people read the
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:13.800]   story more exactly and and so and the other truth was that all along as soon as facebook
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.480]   identifies something that might be questionable and they sent it to the fact checkers they stopped
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:23.000]   promoting it so it already had the impact of not bringing traffic to it because facebook wasn't
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.960]   promoting it that's the issue the flag was kind of meaningless so now instead facebook is going to
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.440]   give you related content and see that study i quoted earlier in the show where being exposed to other
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:40.120]   news um as long as it's not you know trying to say you idiot this is what you should see if it's
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.440]   just saying here's some more choices that it can have an impact and that that's what facebook ought
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:52.120]   to be doing the red flag that they were putting up next to stories made people believe the stories
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.160]   not disbelieve them because they don't like the institutions oh face oh right this proves it
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.520]   this proves it because now see what they're doing they're pretending it's fake news you see
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.640]   you see that means it's true or they wouldn't be denying oh yeah no there's the snopes is funded
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:15.000]   by by saw us to discredit the right wing meme right there's this there's there's there's
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.960]   the layers of um it's turtles all the way down isn't it it's just nothing you can do it is indeed
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:28.040]   a visit to facebook's recently opened center for deleting content this is motherboard what a fun
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:35.560]   place that in s in germany is the center for deleting content and it's it's a separate company

[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:10.040]   is amazon gonna buy target no we did that we did that no we did no we did do amazon no
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.560]   this is a new one this is not the uh apple buying disney this is a prominent analyst predicts
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   amazon will take over target this year which actually would make a lot of sense target by the
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:31.480]   way is one of the places you could shop on uh your google home that's right so jean monster though is
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:37.800]   known for missing the boat sometimes he's the analyst who predicts it target is the isle deeil
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.400]   offline partner for amazon i was in a whole foods yesterday they have lockers you know that you
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.320]   can get your amazon stuff delivered to but i asked the clerk she said you know most people use it for
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.520]   two returns you don't have to ship returns back you just bring put it in the locker
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.080]   scan the thing put it in the locker which which saves everybody saves it yeah
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:00.280]   as i can i don't mind having deliveries coming to my house i'd prefer it but returns now that's
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:06.840]   another matter so whole foods yep maybe target next that would make a lot of sense a lot of
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.360]   brick and mortar stores and i think target's probably very affordable amazon has been ordered to stop
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:21.160]   luring customers based on misspelled searches for burkin stock man that's like uh that's like
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:27.480]   saying i got candy in this van come here kids yeah german sandalmaker burkin stock filed an
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.560]   injunction complaining the online retailer had been using variations like brick and stock a brick
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:39.640]   and stock uh and buying the adwords luring in customers to buy shoes that aren't actually
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:45.080]   burkin stocks low quality copies however once you get to amazon and search for
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   burkin stocks you can say people who like this also like this yeah the same point i love my
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:56.440]   burkin stocks warn him ever since i was a hippie yeah it would i have a deep connection to
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.240]   burkin stock when i first went first marriage to california we uh bought the house of the
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:06.840]   burkin stock u.s. distributor of burkin stocks and in the garage where it was a mountain i mean
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.080]   literally hundreds of thousands of burkin stock catalogs and every one of them you could put
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.920]   you you'd get your foot wet you put your foot on the back page of it and it makes an imprint of your
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.440]   foot and then you can order the shoe and i just did that to a bunch of them just for fun i was a
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:28.600]   kid what did i know sam song might also announce its galaxy s9 at mobile world congress and uh
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:36.760]   according to gordon kelly a contributor at forbstich means you know who knows uh right who knows
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.080]   who this guy is uh that the the final renders are coming out looks just like the galaxy s8
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.520]   okay will it have a headphone jack is all i care about
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:57.240]   there is a big speed button would i would think this is the differentiator now right it is not a
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:04.200]   pain of the bot it's paying the bot yeah i have to say i took so i brought a very expensive fancy
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.560]   camera to on vacation to in the virgin islands and i brought pixel 2 excel the pictures i took on
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:15.640]   this camera phone were the best this is the there is no question in my mind the pixel 2 excel
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:22.600]   camera is absolutely second and none i mean stunning right out of the camera pictures
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:30.360]   of uh of everything and and very editable i mean it really they just came out fabulous so
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.920]   highly recommend the pixel 2 excel camera i mean
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:41.640]   does the detail of clarity look at this by the way there's a sunken sunken ship
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.080]   and that trashed but the clarity i mean if i zoom in
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:52.840]   it's pretty amazing yeah really good really good camera this isn't most the shots were in bright
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:23:01.480]   light so that that might have something to do with it but there's a fish on the barbie
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.840]   there's my son taking a picture of a fish on the barbie

[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.720]   okay i really am fed up with twitter what else is out there and starting to look at the
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.120]   the indy web toolkits that we've been gradually building up over the last
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.320]   few years and one that's that's doing fairly well of this is micro dot blog
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:25.480]   um which is manton reese's side um he opened up so he opened up signups recently um so it's
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:31.560]   built on the indy web standards you can you can just use it as a place to read and and write
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.760]   but also you can wire it up to your existing sites and feed them through as well
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.520]   so it's it's it's it's an interesting one to look at is he's he's he's like
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.000]   sort of reinventing the sort of readable integrated reader blogging model
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:51.480]   yeah i uh it's funny because um i uh i was i when you talked about it maybe a year ago i
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:58.200]   signed it was indy gogo he crowd funded it yes yeah yeah and i uh and i did it and i've been on
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.000]   there ever since and then i went back the other day because i uh you know i was i don't know i
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.160]   can't remember why and i've been posting all along because i was wise enough and forgot it
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:13.960]   to wired into all my other stuff so there's lots of content on there yeah uh so it's really
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:21.560]   it's kind of cute micro dot blog and it was only open to the people who funded it um up until
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:27.320]   recently but now you there's a sign up link as well so give it a look that's cool yeah get
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.560]   well i'd like to get more people uh on it and and i'd like to get the president on it
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:40.520]   i think that'd be it'd be fun i have something out of the uh out of the uh the uk that i thought
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:45.640]   was really cool and i came to my notice uh today because mercedes benzen asked they were going to
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:51.000]   adopt it in their car navigation systems going forward it's a british company called what three
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.120]   words turns out uh you can divide the entire globe into 10 meter by 10 meter segments there's
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:08.920]   trillions of them and then assign uh three words to each of those and so the for instance if you
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:15.000]   wanted to visit the twit brick house our three words are glo nays walnut and nasal glo walnut
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.600]   nasal and then you can feed that into your mercedes or senate does it does the order matter
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:28.120]   yes because it's uh it's trying it's triangulating it's a grid so uh give me an address let's do the
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:35.400]   white house the white house pennsylvania avenue northwest washington you see is kicks mirror tops
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.720]   kicks mirror tops and then if you have the app and you can get it on and right in ios
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:50.440]   you can put in any three words and it will then send that to google maps or ways or apple maps
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.840]   and navigate you to that place because it turns it into uh coordinates latitude and longitude
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.640]   coordinates i just love it it's very fun i brought to this to the show about three or four years ago
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.720]   you did yes yes somewhere in the in the archives it's there somebody okay so we just never thought
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.280]   well bobby luellin tweeted this the one tweeted this morning about it uh he said
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.920]   elan you should adopt it now that mercedes is i just think it's the coolest thing so you know all about
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.040]   it i yeah well i want to yeah we got to give this traction it's a really good idea it's it's
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:30.360]   well it isn't it isn't i mean the challenge is is that it's not it's more fragile than actual
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.160]   addresses because if you miss remember a word or you change the order you end up somewhere entirely
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   different yes yes that's true so it it's um it is edited it is a bit odd whereas the the things
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:49.000]   you know there were other things that gave you a short um ones that basically each letter is
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:56.760]   reducing the space by power you know power a factor is 26 or whatever um and so oh so you can
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:03.960]   you can get it wrong but still get close it's a use case yeah yeah um yeah let's see what i can
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:09.640]   i probably do okay you're sort of wired into their dictionary which is a bit weird i'm not
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:15.240]   uh and then they changed it but it was it was hard to actually work at what was going on without
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:21.640]   without them keeping it up i think big big band is a tools finishing nobody just saying what three
