[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   It's time for Twig this week at Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.920]   Aunt Pruitt has the week off, but sitting in his seat, we've got Sam Lesson.

[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   Stacey Higginbotham is here. Stacey on IOT.com. Preparing. She's already behind. She says for Thanksgiving already.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.760]   Yes. Already behind my turkey. My chicken is not in its brine yet. And the cranberries have been cooked.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.320]   Oh, you might. I give you, I give you dispensation to run and put that turkey in the salt.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.120]   Well, it's not, it's not a turkey. It's a chicken. So as long as it's overnight, it's technically fine.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.800]   Won't take as long. Yeah. Yeah. You, you're the one who a couple of years ago showed us your Gantt chart.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   Oh, the Gantt chart is essential. When you're hosting Thanksgiving for 12, and I will tell you, all my food comes out exactly on time and high.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760]   I copied you because of that. And I do a Gantt chart now too. I even put on their refrigerator.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.320]   What else? Who needs scrum it?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.600]   Scrum it.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.480]   Already getting plugs in for his investments. We're going to get to him in just a second. But first,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   Jeff Jarvis, professor, Leonard Taop, professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:31.640]   We got the way from posting just for that graduate school in journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.080]   Hey, Sam, that's a long standing joke. We will bother us.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.640]   Poor Sam lesson. I tell you. Hey, so guess who's here? This is a thrill. I'm very excited.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.320]   I've been a fan of Sam's since he came up with Drop.io, which was the greatest little way to share files.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.160]   Facebook bought it. And then you worked at Facebook for so how long were you at Facebook, Sam?
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.960]   About most exactly four years.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.520]   Four years.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.440]   To the IPO and a lot of the fun.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:09.160]   Welcome. And now he general partner at his VC firm, slow.co SLO.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.960]   Slow ventures. Slow ventures. We couldn't get the dot com. I don't know what we're too cheap to buy the dot com.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.240]   I like slow.co. I think that's very memorable. I love it.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   Slower. And Sam, I'd love to know who whoever is Sam at slow.com gets a lot of deal flow.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   I'll tell you that.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.920]   That's pretty funny. Sam, your years were burning last week, I'm sure, because you were all the
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.320]   news all over town because of your investment in creators. And we thought, well, we better get
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.480]   Sam on if we can to explain this because traditionally venture capitalists invest in companies,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.720]   although as you pointed out, you're always investing in the team. You're always investing
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.160]   in the people as much as the idea. What gave you the idea to invest in the people directly?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.480]   Well, it's actually ironically an old idea. So I guess we've known each other for what?
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.720]   10 plus years now. You've never invested in me. I'm just going to point that out.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.640]   No, you didn't know and gave me the opportunity.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.560]   When I was literally in senior year of high school, I was watching, if you remember,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.400]   way back in the day, Martha Stewart, Home Living, Going Public and all this stuff.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.160]   And I was like, you know, and I started a company, I stole them the domain, LifeCapital.com,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   to try to do this, right? In high school.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.000]   And you always to say, look, in high school, well, this is part of how I got into college, I think.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.040]   They were so impressed by LifeCapital.com, they said.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.600]   Well, you know, at the time it wasn't, you know, back in those years, the kids starting
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   companies wasn't quite as calm as it is today. So I think it was a reasonably original thing to
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   be trying to do. And, you know, back then, I had the narrative I had was, look, debt's terrible,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.000]   right? Debt forces you to, you go to law school, you have to become a corporate lawyer to pay off
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.280]   your blah, blah, blah, you know, it sticks you in paths. The world is getting crazy and you want
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600]   people to have as much freedom as possible. That's how you get the biggest outcomes and the most
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.640]   interesting stuff. So wouldn't it be cool if instead of just having debt for people, you had
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.520]   debt options and equity options, just like you do for companies. Back then everyone thought I was
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.720]   crazy. So, you know, really, other than a bunch of working with some lawyers and kind of some ideas
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.120]   and kind of shopping, I never really went anywhere. But fast forward, it's now been almost, you know,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.840]   it's been more than 20 years, I guess. And, you know, a bunch of trends have played out that make
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.240]   this make all the sense in the world, right? One is everyone now understands how the internet
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   makes outcomes way more discontinuous than they ever were before. So gone are the days of, you know,
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.720]   you get a career, you have certain pay raises every year, you know, your trajectory. That's really
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.520]   easy to finance with debt. But modern careers, you can have a great year, you have a terrible year,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.320]   you know, some people do amazingly well. You have the, you know, Jeff Bezos of the world, a lot of
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.960]   people don't, there's a lot of discontinuity. It's super hard to finance well with debt. But
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   people all of a sudden say, "Oh my God, you know, if I had equity, right, an equity-based approach is
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.040]   way better suited to finance." And that's the big picture. Everyone's woke up to the fact that
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.120]   people piling on debt, young, and their lives is really quite stifling in a lot of ways. So,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.800]   there's got to be a better way to do this, right? And so there's a bunch of big picture things. And
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.960]   then the specific thing we're starting with that makes attention opportunity now is the creator
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.760]   economy, right? Where you're seeing these people start effectively micro-businesses, just them,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.280]   in a lot of cases, they're building a brand and a community long before they're building a product.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.600]   But there's a lot of value being built. And these people don't have access in general to true equity
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.160]   financing, right? Either they operate off of cash flow. So what we started to say is it's finally
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.320]   time to do this for real. Let's finance creators as individuals, just like we would any other business.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.640]   But the really big thing, which I think, you know, causes maybe the controversy around this, is the
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.080]   way we look at this is if we're going to put $500,000 a million, whatever dollars, into a person,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.920]   versus a company, what we say is we're kind of investing in the basket of what you do
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.800]   with that capital over time. So we say there are no restrictions on how you deploy it.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.880]   It's here to support you if you want to put it into audience building great or product development,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.640]   whatever you want. But all that money and capital we're putting in is building your brand and your
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.840]   identity, right? And like the value of your community. And so we want to be dealt in over the long
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.880]   term. We say we take a very low percentage over a long period of time, so 30 years. So basically,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   your whole career. And we say, look, we'll do the capital upfront. If you do great, if you're the
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.760]   next Jeff Bezos, we get venture like returns, right? But if you don't do well, it's fine. I mean,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.600]   again, our firm is fundamentally a seed firm. We're used to losing money, we're used to things
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.080]   not working out. We're not trying to monetize people that don't work.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.920]   Was it hard to convince the partners that this made sense? I mean, I don't think there's much
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.600]   of a precedent for it. I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think I have a lot of people have talked about this a lot.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   Anyway, you want I mean, please. Well, one thing people brought up is indentured servitude.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.440]   And you pretty who brought that up? Can I can I call out names? I have to admit, I haven't seen
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.040]   you here. I'm over here. But I think that the mother in the motherboard interview you did,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   I think they did invoke the holidays. I think that that is I think that's lazy,
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   honestly, to call it indentured servitude. There's no question that culturally, for good reasons,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.960]   especially in the United States, there's a lot of sensitivity around any of these like long-term
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   capital oriented relationships, right? We know why we get the contest. But it's actually the
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.280]   opposite of indentured servitude, right? Because you're saying to people, you don't only anything.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.840]   This isn't a record label deal. If I invest in you and you decide to go sit on a beach for the next
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   30 years, there's nothing I can do about it. That's one of my risks, right? I have no control over
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.240]   what you do, you know, at all. So there's no contractual. I would actually argue debt. I'd
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.760]   actually argue debt is a lot closer to indentured servitude than you do them all. Absolutely.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.520]   So you don't have a contractual agreement that they will continue to pursue their creator path,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.280]   or, you know, that they'll keep making YouTube videos, nothing like that, nothing to protect you.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.760]   No, in fact, it's actually the opposite. We say if you don't, let's pretend you go and flip burgers
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.560]   or you're a corporate lawyer, we have a structure we kind of come up with or an idea of saying,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.640]   like, that's not even part of the deal. Like, if you just decide, we take that risk, you know,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.760]   so you put a fence around the definition of the activities.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.200]   We do, but the fence is basically defined like this, which says, if you go take a job,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.960]   where there's a market price for the job, right, meeting other people that aren't you,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.200]   make the same doing these out the same thing, that's out of the deal. If you go and use your
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   expertise you've developed as, I don't know, a food celebrity to work on a food channel show,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.400]   where they're paying you because it's you, right? Then we are obviously, we wrote that out in that
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.960]   part, but we basically are saying like, we'll invest in you in your, in the equity of your creator
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.400]   brand in this case. We've also done entrepreneurs, by the way, separate, separate structure,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.000]   which I don't think was talked about in the motherboard article, but it's also really cool.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.480]   But for the creators, we say, look, we'll, we'll, we'll do it that way. We ring fence things that are
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.400]   related to the brand you're building, the community you're building, and also the,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.200]   the knowledge IP you build, right, as a part of being a creator.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.120]   Stacey, go ahead.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.760]   I see you first.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:30.200]   Are you looking for venture style returns on this? And like, in terms of like, oh, hey,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:37.080]   I'm going to have five to six flameouts, a couple decent ones, and then two or one, like,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.960]   10 X returns?
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think the, the, the long answer, the short answer is yes, right?
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.440]   And, and we actually even ring fence is not even only ring fence around.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.880]   We only monitor, you know, we only, we're looking for failures, but actually the way we
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   structure these deals is if you make less than actually, in some cases, quite a bit of money,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.040]   like a few hundred thousand dollars a year, we don't even want a percentage of that.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.560]   Like we're not even trying to monetize the okay cases, but our view is that there,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.320]   these are hits driven businesses like anything else. And if you do super well,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   because of the capital we put in or helped by the cap we put in, we want to see a big return.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.720]   And the thing people I think need to recognize, which I think if you're an investor around the VC,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   because then you get, but it's hard for people to understand is that it's very important
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.960]   that we are able to monetize fully the winners, right? That we get our 5% of Jeff Bezos, our 10
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.600]   billion dollars there, because that makes the cost of capital cheaper for everyone else, right?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.880]   And that's, I think the really important thing and a lot of how the structure is set up and why
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.040]   we care about it to be 30 years and why it has to be kind of broad based, because what you really
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.240]   don't want, the only way the structure fails is not if you have a bunch of losers, because you will,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   right? And that's fine. That's part of the model. That's actually part of just the technology
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.160]   future we exist in today is that it's very discontinuous in terms of who wins and who loses.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.520]   But you have to make sure you get paid on the winning cases so that you can afford all the losses
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:01.320]   and all the other cases. And I would think it'd be, that's an issue just because the more successful
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.280]   you are, the more money you can throw at lawyers to get you out of weird contracts that will require
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.720]   you to pay 5% if you're earning. Well, I think the question is, I don't think it's that weird
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   for what it's worth, but at that point it's certainly new, but I wouldn't say it's weird. What I would
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.000]   say is this, the thing you have to really protect against is the Larry Ellison case, which is, a
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.920]   lot of people say, look, we love the deal, can it be a 10 year deal, right? Can it be a five year
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.200]   deal? Can we make it shorter? Because 30 is a big number. We say, look, honestly, no, because
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.480]   the problem is super easy to borrow, right? Until you kind of get past the deal terms and then,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.200]   you'll pay it, it's very easy to do. But we say, we don't ever want to make the people we invest
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.640]   and make unnatural decisions because of the structure. So take, again, we'll be silly and use,
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:53.240]   let's pretend we had bought 5% of Jeff Bezos before he was Jeff Bezos. To this date, we only
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.600]   monetize when he sells, right? No profits for him, no profits for us. So in his case, we'd still be
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.960]   waiting, right? Because he hasn't sold very much, he's just borrowed. But honestly, I'm fine with that,
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.000]   right? Because the reality is, is we would still have a very monetizable asset in what we have.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.640]   And someday, in some level, he will sell, right? You'd like to make it until death do you part,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.600]   really? That's what I'd like to do. But that's, I think, the spirit of what we do. But in practice,
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.120]   even I got convinced of the lawyers at 30 years as a good pound. Infinite's not good. So far,
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.480]   the one we know about is your investment in a YouTuber, Marina Mulgoco, 31 years old. She's
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:44.200]   a YouTube personality. You gave her 1.7 million. And what else? You know, I'm thinking about the
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.320]   traditional way of doing this is kind of more like an agent or a manager, where somebody would
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:56.280]   say, Hey, look, I like you, kid, you're going places. Give me 10% or more of the bookings I get
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.600]   you and we'll work together. And then the agent goes out and promotes this person with no risk.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.560]   The agent has no risk and only has 10%
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.960]   And bad and well, the agent has no risk. He also has bad incentives, right?
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.760]   Well, does any of good incentives? He's only going to make 10% of what he of the jobs he gets you.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.680]   Yeah, but the thing is the problem with the agent model, and this is with respect for agents,
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.200]   we love to work with a lot of them. But again, it is a sweat equity role where your job is to
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.280]   basically make the person as much money as you possibly can until you get fired and they move on.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.080]   Right. And so because it incentivizes a lot of short-term thinking,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.440]   bookings, there's also no dollar investment, right? Which in the end of the day, you think
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:42.040]   about what really unlocks growth and potential, it's capital is pretty useful, right? I'll take
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.680]   10% of whatever I bring in. Let me go be a salesman for you, right? Which is effectively what agents do.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.160]   Right.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.240]   Is a very different model. In fact, one thing we have to work really hard to educate people on
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.440]   is that we're capitalists, we're not service people. So I talked to a lot of creators and they say,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.080]   great, we love the capital. What services do you provide?
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.600]   Yes. We're like, yes. Someone's joking. Someone's telling us, I say nothing. I give you nothing.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.800]   I'm not even a traditional advisory role of a venture company.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:14.120]   No, of course we do that. And we have a lot of incentives to do that. But I think I actually do
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   this with our traditional investments as well as I really don't believe in this hybrid service
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.440]   slash capital world. I just don't think it makes any sense. I mean, I started my career
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.080]   abaining company. I can tell you service businesses are not good businesses and they get competed to
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.120]   zero marginal value. And the reason to do this type of deal with us is because you can use the
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.440]   capital and you know what to do with it. I find entrepreneurs who are asking for all the support
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.760]   and services, among other things, same thing with creators, it's actually kind of a pretty
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.640]   negative signal about what they know what they're getting themselves into.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   Right. You're going to make it easy for them. So we try to be. We try to say,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:56.200]   this way you get your money. Right. Yeah, that's it. And you get to deploy more capital because
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.400]   you don't have to spend the time on, you know, you want like a traditional VC gets limited to a
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.760]   couple companies. Well, and also, I mean, I would argue that a VC probably doesn't, no one knows
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:13.880]   how to make a creator successful at this point. It's so new. I will. I'm very negative in general.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.920]   I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, go ahead. I'll first say, look, in general, look,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.120]   are even our traditional seed practice, which is, you know, I'm proud to say,
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.240]   they've been extremely successful at slow ventures. We don't do board seats, right? We are very good
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   at text messaging. I think we're very good advocates. We have a very high net promoter score
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.040]   with the people that we do investment with, but we try to be very anti service, partially
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.600]   rescalability. But partially because again, I just, I think, you know, if people knew how to cookie
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.960]   cutter make startup successful or cookie cutter make creators successful, you've lived in a very
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.520]   different world. This is hard. There are things that are valuable, but I think you got to call
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.760]   us beta spade and say, you're doing something super hard. We respect the talent. We respect what
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:00.120]   you've accomplished so far and what you can respect. If 1.5 million, 5 million, whatever the number is,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.080]   demonstrably changes your trajectory, helps you do way better. You know how to deploy the capital.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.360]   We're all ears. If you want, you know, someone to cry, to cry to and to, you know, be your partner
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.400]   and everything. Like, I think that's just a misread of what capital does for people.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.320]   Right. It's still lonely. Right. So Sam, I'll be like,
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.240]   and run this better if I can. So at our, of our little journalism school, the Craig, Craig, Craig,
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.840]   Craig, Craig, Newmark graduate school journalism, I started a program in entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.240]   And it was basically, Hey kids, let's start a company. But that didn't, it worked for a while,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.960]   but but starting a company is difficult. It's more than journalists do. It's not investable.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.840]   So we changed it recently because there are so many new ways for creators to make money,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.080]   sub-stag, Kickstarter, Patreon, at all. And so it's now aimed at the individual
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.520]   journalist, most cases, trying to serve directly a market or a community,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.560]   using all these tools as a creator. So I got two questions for you. The first is whether
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.720]   we should be looking at that as a model to support this kind of journalism going forward.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.960]   Yeah. And then the second question, go with that first.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.400]   So I think the answer is probably, you know, I think that the journalism world,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.240]   obviously, you have to look at the economics of it. You know, my wife obviously started,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.760]   pretty successful publication as a journalist, you know, building a business that now has,
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.240]   you know, 50 full-time employees and like, you know, it's profitable in the whole nine yards.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   You know, candidly, it's another topic for another day. But I think the question of
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.320]   how big of a business can you build on sub-stack is an interesting one. You know,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.240]   I think it's very easy to get started, but it's, it asymptotes very quickly, right,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.520]   as an individual journalism creator. But I, so I think it's very hard to build serious revenue
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.600]   doing that. It's very easy to kind of support a lifestyle or even a very good individual salary
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.840]   doing that. You know, I think the thing that come back to you for our financing model is it
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.480]   works really well when there is a low probability chance of the outcome being enormous, right?
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.080]   You know, for a given creator. It's hard when it's very, very bounded. So for instance,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.480]   you know, this model does not work very well if you want to build a doctor, right? Because I know
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.680]   what you're going to make. You're not going to make infinity, you know, it's kind of like,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.440]   there's, it's actually dead. It's actually pretty good structure for that. The question about whether
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.720]   this works for journalism, I think is a longer conversation. It could, but I think you'd have to
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.320]   look kind of more broadly at that. I think it's hard for print journalism alone to support those
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.160]   types of outcomes, if that makes sense. The possible.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.080]   Also, the second question related real quickly, if I can, is we talked about this last week.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.160]   I think you probably just answered the question, but I still want to try to push this. Is there a
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.640]   model in which you could envision not your exact model, but is there a world in which you could
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:55.160]   envision the reversal you created becoming the new model for scholarships? That is to say,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   people pay back based on their success in life. And in the total pool, you end up supporting
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.800]   more education and more success with less debt and more sharing.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.400]   Can I just stick this in? Yale did this and I signed up for it.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.000]   It did. It was called the tuition postponement option. And it ended up being kind of horrific,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.240]   because you know, I'm paid. Yeah, well, you borrowed as a pool, right? And so your entire
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.880]   class borrowed a certain amount of money. And the entire class paid it back as a percentage of
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.400]   income, not as a flat amount or with interest, as a percentage of income until the entire class
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.640]   pool had been paid off, which often meant this went on for a long time. I didn't borrow that
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.320]   much money, but I borrowed some and we did finally pay it off. It took us about 20 years
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.240]   to do it, but it was a very odd, it was a clever idea. You're obviously familiar with it, Sam.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.840]   Yes, I am. There have been several experiments in education around this actually over the years.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.760]   There was, I'm not sure if this is the same one, but Yale also did a program like this in a long
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.240]   long time in the law school that was another flavor of this. So it's been tried. There have
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.720]   been issues with repayment. They stopped. There's a bunch of issues that have come. Yeah. I'm sure
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.840]   they did. I think it was a short lived experiment. I mean, look, people have been sniffing around
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:19.320]   versions of this idea forever. And just stepping all the way back, if we're going to have a society
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.040]   where a small number of people do extremely well and the average doesn't and it's hard to model
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.560]   those outcomes, that is just a very bad capital product for that future. So we say, where does this
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.480]   go in the future? I think there's a whole version. If you told me that actually the right model for
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.440]   society was, and I'm making this up, obviously, but a version of UBI, which is like, you know,
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   when you're 21, the government just gives you a million dollars, every single person.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.160]   And then you're paying it back in a form of taxes.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.800]   That's not insane, right? In terms of actually raising overall productivity, freedom, and like
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.160]   creating more financial upside for everyone. That model, some in some version of UBI makes a lot
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.800]   of sense to me. Then I think backing off of it, I think you get to different click stops. But,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.560]   the answer is, I think there's a lot of things you can finance with it, but not everything.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.680]   And I do think, keep in mind the fact that even you look at traditional companies,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.800]   on a relative basis, risk-adjusted basis, if you can get debt in a way that makes sense,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.560]   debt's a great product, right? I don't want to be like, debt does make sense. Like if there's,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   you know, even as a company, it's really wonderful. If you raise some equity that you can then
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.640]   borrow money in certain cases, and it's a very capital efficient thing to do,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.600]   I just think the reality is for a lot of people, especially creators, especially solo entrepreneurs,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.520]   there is a hole where there's not a capital product being offered to them, and like we'd love to
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:47.480]   offer it. It's kind of that simple. So it's just basically not a grant, but you give them a certain
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.880]   flat amount of money. Do you find it difficult to convince these creators?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.600]   Part of my problem is, in my world, a creator is not necessarily a good business person.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:06.120]   And this is part of the problem is that, and I'm one of them, so I can create content
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:14.040]   like crazy, but I couldn't run a business to save my life. In my case, I got my wife to run the business
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:20.760]   for me. Mr. Beast has his mom run in the business. That's part of the problem. Very few Jessica
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.240]   lessons in the world who are both great journalists and know how to start and run a business.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.000]   Yeah, I mean, look, I think that the future is more and more creators, though, that are really
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.160]   entrepreneurs and business people as well. And this is not a product that today works for everyone.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.360]   I mean, people frequently ask me, like, well, how do you convince people that take this?
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.920]   I'm like, I don't, right? Like, I think you put it out there. And a small number of people say,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.560]   this is perfect for me. I get it. And you meet them and you understand how they think about business
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.160]   and what they're trying to build and how they think about content. Like, yep, this makes sense.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.000]   Aren't you worried that you're going to self-select for people who are good business people,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.440]   but that's not necessarily great creators. I think that we're learning how to do both.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.520]   But I think there is an intersection of those two. Like Marina, I think it's a great first
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.040]   example of some of those both. And like, that's kind of what you're looking for now. Now, over time,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   in history, in the coming years, my sense is that a lot of these creators are getting more and
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.600]   more business savvy, right? Because they have to. They have to. It's also, you know, again,
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.160]   like you think about the whole system of you're the talent. I'm the agent, you know, the Hollywood
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.000]   style system is breaking down. And instead, it's going to be, look, you're a content creator,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.840]   you're blew up on TikTok, you know, you're building independent brands good for you.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.520]   Yeah, that's a shift. It's a hybrid model.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.320]   We talked about that because I come from old media. That's the shift. In the old days,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.640]   you're a creator, you went to work for a company that would then support your efforts
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:46.280]   and let you do what you do. But I think that that maybe is that over? That's kind of what
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.080]   journalism is to Jeff, right? If you're a journalist, you also learn a business,
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.320]   you expect it to go to work for a newspaper.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.800]   And you also leave, you know, for my days of timing, you leave the, I think we're leaving the,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.560]   not completely, but we're leaving the era of the blockbuster economy.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:11.000]   And there's more 15 minute celebrities. And there's fewer huge hits and look what's happened
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.640]   in the music industry. There's more good, sustainable creativity going on than there was,
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   supported in more ways. And, but is there, you know, is there a next, you have to have a Dell
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.400]   to make it work?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.960]   But Sam seems to be saying he's investing in a Dell's and that makes his model work, yes?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   Well, I think it's, look, the answer is we're figuring it out, but I look, obviously,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   in a Dell is great as an outcome. I think it's hard to pick a Dell, right? Especially, you know,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.640]   from zero and there aren't enough of them. I would note that, you know, it's interesting.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.680]   As we move towards what I see as kind of a cult driven future where there's no single
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:55.560]   mass media, we're not all watching science itself, right? But, but, you know, curbing enthusiasm
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.640]   for a niche is just as powerful and it's a big niche and it's global. You know, there's a lot
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.880]   of very, very, very, very, very, so that's plenty bigger.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.040]   So that's plenty bigger.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.880]   That are developing. I think it's, you know, I think that, you know, there are enormous
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.720]   businesses being built in these weird internet niches. I think that's only going to continue.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.640]   You know, we talk about quote unquote meta versus and whatever. I mean, there's no question.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:20.200]   There's a fracturing of what was once the global single dialogue and 2000s of smaller
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.840]   dialogues, but those thousands at, you know, set with seven billion people online,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.640]   they're still very big. And the reality is the engagement with them is higher than ever, right?
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.680]   So, you know, I'm sorry, we're not on CNBC, but Mr. B says a hell of a following and
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.040]   commoditize the crap out of it, right? And so you could, you could do that.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.000]   I actually think that's kind of more of the world.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.160]   Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. You can really be built for a poster creator economy.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.760]   I think it's post, I think it's post blockbuster creator economy with every once in a while.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.560]   There will be a blockbuster. Yeah. Okay.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.360]   Just because it happens. And if you're on them, great, right? But I don't mean you can manufacture
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:03.240]   those necessarily. So if you put in $1.7 million, it doesn't take much of a return to get that
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.800]   money back over 30 years, even a five percent. Yeah. Remember, we're venture capitalists,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.080]   so we do make a lot more than our money back to justify it to our LPs.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.840]   Yeah. So what do you expect? What do you want? I mean, look, here's my honest answer.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.360]   You know, we're trying to make this a strong IRR deal that works for us on a long-term basis.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.840]   We're actually not actually targeting what would be in traditionally considered venture capital
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.640]   returns. You know, the stuff we do in crypto, the stuff we do with SaaS, you know, as a very
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.960]   different return signature, because in five years, you know, we're going to have markups from series
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.120]   A firms and then we're going to have public public publics that we don't expect the same curves here.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.080]   For now, we're financing this kind of out of our own vehicles. We're learning a lot. We think
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.160]   they're very strong deals and we're able to kind of work in the ecosystem in cool ways.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.720]   My bet is, is that for this to get really big, though, you will have separate funds that are not
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.240]   actually venture capital. Maybe they're run by venture capitalists like me, but they have
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.600]   different return profiles and different return targets. Not to mention like more technicalities,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.560]   like for instance, venture capitalists generally hate getting money back. We hate profits.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.640]   Turns out that like creators generally do generate those, right?
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.080]   You want an exit? Are you saying you want an exit? Is that what you're saying?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.360]   No, they want to build out your companies. There's no exit with a creator unless they
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.840]   not not yet. I think that and that's the other thing again. You talk about what, you know,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.200]   well, look, I think I wrote an article, you know, over the summer that I was pretty proud,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.240]   got pretty widely distributed and read about how kind of the end of this era of venture capital.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.960]   And what basically the point was you look at SaaS investing, consumer investing. This was a
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.280]   weird niche thing being done on the West Coast where no one understood the financial models.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.360]   And so venture capitalists who had an opinion about it could make a lot of money.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.040]   But just like any good industry, now everyone understands the models. Everyone understands
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.800]   how to think about a SaaS evaluation. They're public comps. Like there's a whole market apparatus
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.040]   around it, which is why you see the big East Coast firms, you know, the hedge funds coming in like
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.800]   crazy. And I'd actually argue that a lot of traditional internet investing is really not
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.520]   venture capital anymore, right? So our job is real venture capitalists, right? It's to go out
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.080]   and find the new things where there's a capital gap where people could use money to do amazing
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.280]   things, but don't have access to it, put money in. And then the realities, the models have to be
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.840]   built, the capital pipelines have to be built. You know, you're going to need some version of a
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.400]   quote unquote public market. Probably won't be the New York Stock Exchange might be in crypto,
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.200]   right? Where you can kind of think about how these things eventually trade things like that. So,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.840]   you know, what we envision here is just very first principles, two things. There's no question
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.080]   that from a first principles perspective, a equity oriented product for creators, true equity,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   makes a lot of sense. And that there's real demand for it. There are great creators out there that
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.520]   can use the capital. And then there's a whole bunch of missing things from models to, you know,
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.760]   liquidity options, whatever that don't exist yet that we think will come to exist. But we think
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.120]   the way you do that is by starting to just go and like help build the ecosystem around it over time.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.920]   Stacy, would you have done would you have sought this at a point and when you were starting your
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:11.800]   adventure? No, no, I think venture capital is the devil for building any sort of business
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.080]   that you want to be sustainable. Like journalism is just not a business that fits with something
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.200]   like this. I'm like, what is with Stacy? Yeah. And for what is with Stacy, I actually, I mean,
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.880]   like, Jeff, I think you know, this like my wife, you know, despite the fact that I am a venture
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.800]   capitalist, you know, the information has never taken a dime of venture capital, right?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:35.720]   It's been self-balanced from day one because I generally agree, right, which is that especially
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.160]   journalism is generally a very poor fit historically for venture capital. It doesn't grow fast enough.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.360]   It creates weird pressures. It's way better, especially with a long-term mission to not have it.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.160]   But again, that doesn't mean there aren't exceptions to that. You know, actually,
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:57.560]   it's done really well with venture capital. You seem to thrive, Sam, in unstable environments.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.360]   Your point in your piece and the information was that venture capital is basically just
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:09.720]   turning into finance. Yeah. And clearly investing in a creator ecosystem is something
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:17.800]   that's you're throwing your money into a turbulent pool because it's so fast,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   so changing so fast and it's so unknown. Do you think that's where the opportunity lies, though,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.760]   is in these eras of great change? I mean, look, absolutely, that's what I think. I mean,
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.640]   I think, you know, again, you know, look at our venture firms. We have made far and away more money
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:41.560]   in the crypto ecosystem than anything else. And why? It's because in the 2017 era, when no other
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.600]   venture firms were doing it or very few, we heavily invested in a bunch of the layer one
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.680]   protocols like Solana that have become, you know, some of the most important protocols at the moment,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.000]   you know, in crypto and pretty foundational. I think that it's pretty simple, you know,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.120]   putting capital where capital isn't is the way you make all the returns. And also, frankly,
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.520]   it's how you have an impact. It's how you have an impact, too. I mean, I do believe in having an
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.800]   impact and I believe capitalism is good. You know, simply bidding on, you know, bidding up the same
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.320]   things everyone else is investing in is both very boring. And it's also very, I don't think it's
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.040]   that profitable. And I think it's very low impact, whereas using capital and kind of the freedom
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   that venture capital allows you to have to go with a new thesis into new spaces and push the envelope,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.360]   you're going to lose money all the time, right? Like I joke that I think one of my maybe advantages
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.800]   is I don't mind losing money as long as I make a lot of money sometimes.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   Sam's article on the information investing directly in people is the future of VC. Here's
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   how to do it really is a roadmap for this and fascinating. And he's an intern at the information,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:53.000]   which I think is hysterical. I would love to hear Sam, what types of creators you're in. Like,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.680]   usually when people talk about creators, they think, you know, oh, it's a TikTok person. It's
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.880]   someone in YouTube or Instagram. But there are other, I mean, you mentioned an entrepreneur's
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.200]   fun too. So I'd be curious, like, what specifically you're looking for in the creator side. And if
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.600]   you actually could talk about the entrepreneur thing, I'd like to hear it. Sure. Yeah. So, I mean,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:17.000]   look, on the creator, especially in the last year has been so overused as a term, it basically means
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.080]   anyone doing anything, right? So it's a very diffuse term. You know, in general, we are not looking
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   for the 15 minutes of fame folks in party houses in Los Angeles, you know, who want to quickly,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.000]   you know, get a bunch of followers and, you know, do some silly videos and go from there. I think
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.720]   we're much more interested in people that are developing, you know, potentially niche, but like
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:43.320]   deep communities of like that are engaged with them and, you know, with the kind of products
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.160]   they're interested in, in potentially small verticals. So I'll give an example. It's like,
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.720]   you know, could be juggling, right? Someone is like, you know, the king of that or magic or,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:57.560]   you know, in Marina's case, she's a very strong, like Russian, you know, base looking at Silicon
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:03.480]   Valley and trying to be entrepreneurs, languages. So basically, we're very interested in those kind
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.360]   of niches where you have like a real community being built that might be, instead of it being
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.280]   like, you know, community that's just on one platform, it actually has some currency to be
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.920]   cross platform, right? So if you see creators that have not just like a big YouTube channel,
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.840]   but, or, but have like, you really shown the ability to move that audience between a few
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.600]   different platforms and potentially engage them in a few different ways, that's the most exciting
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.560]   to us. But yeah, I mean, I think, I think, look, I think the other kind of angle to all of this is
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.360]   another kind of catchphrase for this is I do think we're moving into what I call like a cult-driven
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.440]   economy in a lot of ways. And those kind of, when you think about those culture, those networks,
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.520]   investing in and supporting the people who are effectively the cult leaders or building
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.400]   those interest groups and kind of maintaining them and driving them is kind of the core, the core
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.600]   thesis. So it can be anyone. It's not just, you know, people on one network or, you know, people
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.280]   who make a certain kind of content, it really is just about that, that stickiness in relationship
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.160]   with their fans and the community that I think matters the most. Sam, you're, you're, you're,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.400]   we're going to have to let Sam go because we've, we only, we, we'd say we can't take them for half
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:13.240]   an hour and a whole hell of a whole time. No, I would love to come back. I, you know, as you know,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.480]   I, a few things in the family front means I have a little limited time. Just had a baby for Christ's
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.520]   sake. You gotta spend some time. But I do want to say congratulations on finally finding a use for
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:29.320]   that domain you registered 20 years ago, life capital.com. You're going to have a life capital event,
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:36.680]   life capital 2021, the future of the professional creator ecosystem, co-hosted by slow ventures and
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.880]   the information that's coming up in April. Chalker who the co-hosts are. How did I get that?
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:48.600]   I love it that despite being married to a VC, Jessica took no money for the event, the information.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.000]   That's, it's, that's a great, that's a great relationship. You two have congratulations
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.360]   on, on your new addition to your family. It's really great to catch up with you again, Sam.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.080]   It's great to catch up as well. Thank you guys. I'm really, honestly, after you explain it, I,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.880]   I am very impressed by what you're doing. Your willingness to take a big chance. And when you
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.920]   describe it as kind of the alternative to debt for raising money for individuals, that makes a lot
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:20.280]   of sense to me. You know, you say in your information piece, oh, I love this line. Let me see. And
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:29.640]   especially because I'm old, you said, why? Because young people have all the equity value
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.080]   in the form of their future sweat and ingenuity. But without the ability to unlock it, we're stuck
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.360]   in a world where old people rule the roost. I think you got a year on to something. Yep.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.320]   Congratulations. Sam, it's a real pleasure to see you again.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.000]   It's great to see you guys. Thanks for having me. We'd love to do it again sometime.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.240]   Yeah. Yeah. We'll have you guys at any time. Yeah. Slow capital doc. Absolutely. All right.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.920]   Take care, Sam. Talk to you. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I hate to cut him off, but,
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:00.520]   I was so great to have that opportunity. Thank you. So smart. No. Oh, he's still there. Thank you,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.960]   guys. Forget I said, forget I said, forget I said, but it is, it is good to see you.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.880]   Now is what we say. The bad things. It's great to see you guys and happy to do more,
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.000]   more on this or whatever you guys want to know. I love you. And I love your red after
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.760]   shot headphones to their sponsors. So thank you. I like them. Yeah, they're great. Thanks, Sam.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.080]   I think I take care. All right. Okay. Now you can say the good things. He really is
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.240]   very eloquent and I think well spoken. I think he made it. I don't know. What do you guys think?
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.760]   You think you made a good case for what he's doing? Yeah. I mean, I think for that
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:42.520]   sub segment, it makes a lot of sense. And yeah, like you, Jeff, I'm still like, oh,
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.040]   how do you fund journalism as a real business? And we still don't forget.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.960]   Maybe forget that. Yeah, forget. Well, I'm trying. I can't blame a guy for trying.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.520]   I think I will say as a lifestyle business, I do super like lifestyle business.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:06.120]   I think having resources. Yeah. But if you could pull some resources to protect against things
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.920]   like lawsuits, I think lifestyle people could go after more like larger stories. I mean,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.400]   like there are certain things I probably would never take on one because it would take too much
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.160]   time away from like what generates the most revenue for me. But also because it'd be terrifying
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   if the company, the bigger company tried to sue me because I would just be like, yeah, okay.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:33.080]   If there's any argument I have against this is it does, frankly, it's going to foster,
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.000]   it's going to they're going to invest in people who have a chance for explosive growth. And that's
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.600]   never going to be lifestyle businesses like journalism. But that's not it.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.080]   I mean, and as he said, that being a physician, being a journalist,
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.760]   borrowing might be a good context for that because you got to steady pay back at a certain amount of
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.040]   time. I don't know if journalists get a steady payback, but sure.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:03.480]   Yeah, well, then you got a bigger problem. You can't make a bad financial,
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:09.160]   bad business model work by throwing money at it. It's a bad business model. It's a bad business model.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:15.240]   Period. I think this could work. B2B is small. Switch to music. So the music industry is
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.360]   is long tail and making it work at that. So I guess part of the question is how big is big
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:25.160]   enough to make it work in Sam's model? How many and what sizes does he need to make the model work?
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:30.840]   The question I was going to ask is, in a sense, he becomes a new patron of the arts. We talked
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.760]   about the difference between this and the Middle Ages and the Renaissance last time.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.040]   But it was a big difference. There's a big difference because a patron of the arts gets no
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.200]   returns. Exactly. All they get is Michelangelo's sistine ceiling and that's that.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:51.320]   Exactly. But he will end up supporting creativity nonetheless. And so what kind of creativity will
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.000]   end up working best in being supported here? And what will the impact of this be if this model takes
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.440]   off? Well, that's what I'm feeling. It's got to have you could look at what worked on Facebook.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.880]   So you get a bunch of like crazy, chaotic people. Well, it's got to have a strong upside over 30
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:16.120]   years. So that's not a lot of things. Can you think of any creator that you followed over 30
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:21.480]   years? Well, that's going to be interesting. I mean, there are some lot of authors. There are
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:28.440]   some people out there on the car, you know, but it's too early to know whether any of the successful
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:37.320]   YouTubers will have a 30 year career. Nobody has yet. I mean, even PewDiePie, I would think is kind
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:42.600]   of on the Wayne. Marquez Brownlee, I don't you know, well, he might have a career for
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.520]   three. Marquez's, Marquez's journalism, Marquez's value, Marquez is a different
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.680]   value perspective. It's like yours. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I think probably
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.840]   I don't know what their metric is, but probably you're not going to see Marquez or
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:01.240]   Twitter have explosive growth. It's going to be more like slow, but steady value. Yeah, you're not
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.320]   a cult. And that's why I kind of tried to ask him because you can get you can get your money back
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:11.000]   on 1.7 million over 30 years at 5%. That's not so hard to do. Marquez would surely
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.240]   deliver those kind of returns. He wanted more than that though. He wanted a big hit.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:21.400]   And that's right. That's interesting. I don't think it fosters journalism that we still I don't
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.880]   I don't think we're ever and we're going to have to rely on the Craig Newmarks. That's true
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.520]   patronage, by the way. That's not it is a date. That's not it. That's patronage.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:37.720]   But look when he gets back a barbershop quartet. He gets love and adulation.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.440]   You know, and I think Jeff Bezos, do you think he thinks he's going to make money on the Washington
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:50.120]   Post? He is. He's making money. Yes, but not on a cash flow basis. He's cash flowing, but he's not
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.760]   going to be rich on it. No, no, no, but you need to be. So that's another kind of picture.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.200]   There is. Yeah, there's societal cache. He gets invited to some pretty cool parties because of it
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.880]   as the public. But he also he also demonstrated how you can make journalism
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:12.600]   successful and good. It's the problem I have is that if that's what we're counting on,
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:19.800]   that's not great, right? Yeah, it'd be much better if journalism had some sort of viable business
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.600]   model. That's that's my that's my life's calling. Yeah, you can't rely on the kindness of strangers
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:30.840]   forever. But that's where the individuals serving communities to me continues to make sense.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.240]   Because journalism is a whole is wildly inefficient. We keep on repeating each other's stuff. We
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.520]   rewrite each other. Whereas Stacy is doing unique reporting that has value. The amount of unique
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:47.400]   reporting that that is provided by the journalism, broad tent that we call it is a small percentage
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.560]   actually. So a lot of enterprise journalism and that you know, enterprise reporting. And
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.840]   unfortunately, that's the most expensive, most complicated and you mentioned lawsuits.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:03.400]   And it realized that it's risky. Yeah. And it takes it takes experience. I mean, like
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:09.080]   the reporter that I am today versus the reporter I started out at is 20 years ago,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:16.120]   even 10 years ago, is very different. And we don't have, I mean, I don't know how many
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.080]   journalists make it all the way through the filter, right? Like how many people are
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:24.440]   a journalist for their entire career? That's. But the other thing is there are other ways to
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:31.160]   contribute to the public wheel. You don't have to be a capital J journalist.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:37.160]   Somebody's talking about Phil DeFranco who's been doing YouTube for 15 years successfully.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.080]   There are, and I think Marquez Brownlee, I is that it's kind of journalism, but it's
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:47.400]   a little different flavor of journalism. I think you can contribute to the conversation without
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:53.160]   being a traditional journalist. So, yeah. So I think that we're just, look,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:58.120]   that's why I was fascinated because Sam is really wading into a turbulent era
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.120]   and saying I'm going to pick winners. It's kind of crazy. But I like that. I like
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.440]   what I do too. I don't think he's trying to. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.600]   Yeah. I don't think he's trying to pick winners. I think he's trying to spread some money to
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.760]   like potential potential winners. Well, I mean, he's admitting that, you know,
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.560]   he's many of the mobility losers, but you're still trying to pick ones that will win.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.360]   Well, yeah. But I mean, nobody throws money indiscriminately around.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.160]   Well, it's like making a movie, right? Most movies are flops. It's the blockbuster model.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.800]   Enough make money that it's a good business to be in. You still think about every script you
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.480]   produce. You hope to make a blockbuster each time out, right? I'm sure he doesn't throw money at
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.200]   creators. He doesn't think you're going to be successful. Just like a publisher, just like a
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.880]   a record label. It can be a blockbuster model, but that doesn't mean you just, you know, give money
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:00.040]   away. You want a winner every single time. Well, but the difference is you could, with the
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.600]   capital that existed in let's say music or in publishing or in movies, you could afford to
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.240]   make away so many. Now, where Sam, I think has something here that again, this is where the
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   scale is so interesting is that sorry, cliche, but long tail, when you have so many more genre,
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:21.000]   I in the Gutenberg book, I quoted numbers from from a study or from an analyst, I think,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   about the number of genres that were supported in mainstream music before. Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.560]   And it's forget the number of artists within those genres, then. Yeah. And so each of those
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:37.160]   is the cult. Yeah, I loved how he said that. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And that
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.920]   these niches will be big enough to support that kind of investment.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:47.800]   Which I love. Yeah, I love. Yeah, I do too. And that's where the more I study it, the more I study
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:54.360]   it, the more I realize how short term of phenomenon mass media was. It was a blip tense. It was a
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:02.440]   play was it was steam power, penny press, magazines. I just got another new book about about about
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   this. I'm about to dig into that argued that the magazines were the basis of mass media.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.880]   And it led to mass marketing mass advertising advertising and attention support for media.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.680]   It led to all these things, some goods, support a lot of creativity, some awful. It's what we're
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.600]   seeing. I think on the internet is the death throes of that model. That's right. I agree.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:30.120]   The worst of Facebook, the worst of the internet worst of clickbait is the death throes of that
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.680]   model. I agree. So what are the new models that come along? That's what interests me and that's
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.160]   what interests him. And that's what I love about it. Yeah. Let's take a little break. That was
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:46.280]   great. Thank you, Sam, for joining us. Our show today brought to you by Akamai Hawaiian for cool,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:52.040]   man. I love Akamai. You probably know the name Akamai powers and protects life online is changing
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.160]   how we live, work and play. That sounds like a bold vision, but it really is. If you want to be
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.200]   on the cutting edge of innovation, you need to be operating at the edge of the internet and nobody
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.720]   can get you there better than Akamai. Because Akamai has 10 times the locations of the nearest
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.560]   competitor over 4,000 points of presence. That means you're always closer to your end user with

[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.920]   innovators can power and protect their greatest ambitions. That's interesting because it's not just
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:31.240]   getting your content to the edge. It's also securing at the edge. If you go to Akamai.com/trig,

[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.240]   everyone online every day. They avoid bottlenecks. They've defended the edge. They've got experts
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.920]   and threat researchers on the front lines of protecting and delivering digital experiences.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:02.440]   Because they're right there and because of their size, they can help your developers build better
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:10.120]   apps and put experiences closer to their customers. It's not a surprise. Akamai is trusted by all 50

[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   telecom carriers, over 500 banks globally, including the top 25 in the US and 22 of the top 25 in
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:32.520]   Europe and the Middle East. That's kind of stunning. The top 25 banks in the US. And of course, with
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:37.480]   banks, it's not just about being at the edge and providing faster service. It's also about being
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:43.880]   secure. And Akamai does both. Akamai's industry leading zero second SLA and 100% platform

[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:59.880]   notification, time to respond, time to access a mitigation resource, individual TMMSLAs,
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.360]   all based on specific attack vectors, they can make those commitments because they deliver.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.760]   Akamai keeps your digital experiences closer to users than anyone. And it keeps the threats
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:16.200]   farther away. That's just the bottom line. And you'll always be one network cop away from 85%

[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.760]   You support us, by the way, as you do with all our advertisers by using that special address
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:14.120]   they know you saw it here. Akamai.com/tweg. So wire cutter tweets, we are not able to make a deal
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:21.320]   with the New York Times. So starting today and through the 29th, they urge you to boycott wire
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:28.440]   cutter and 100% of wire cutter's unit will be striking from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.680]   That's a big deal. I wanted to mention it because I want to support these guys.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.360]   I think the Y. I tweeted it. So none of us go to the wire cutter to buy some stuff. Not me.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.960]   The intelligence served New York magazine. Here's the best strike for most people.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:53.560]   Playing on the wire cutters. Torquerecika is brilliant. Yeah. I don't know if she wrote the
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:52:01.960]   headline. He wrote the headline, but boy, that's a great headline. He does find a former New York
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:08.840]   Times executive who said, yeah, many times staffers don't believe their work is journalism at all.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.400]   The pay scale is substantially different from time salaries.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.840]   They looked down at the wire cutter folks. I guess I understand.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:27.000]   Having joined Time Inc. Yeah. Yes, as part of their digital department. They're like,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.720]   oh, yeah, you're great. And then you would get these snippy little things where they're like,
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:37.080]   no, you're just like Akia, we're the Ferrari. And you're like, mother pluckers.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.400]   Oh, yeah. We had the same experience. When we had a website for a TV show,
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:48.520]   the website's like, oh, you, oh, you dirty web people. I mean, that made sense in like 2002.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:56.040]   It doesn't make sense in 2020 or 2015 wire cutter is a big deal. Go ahead.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.360]   Wire cutter recruited 10,000 subscribers in its first month behind the paywall.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.040]   That's the kind of revenue that makes a big difference to the New York Times.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.240]   It also interesting that that per pitch who's a family member who was in charge of this.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.800]   And I've had him at events at the school because we have a community practice on commerce. So
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.320]   wire cutter has been there, been very helpful in helping other media companies understand how to do
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.880]   this. It really struck me. I think it was about eight months ago or so. I started seeing wire cutter
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.520]   on the home page of the New York Times. And I actually emailed him and said, well, congratulations.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.240]   That's amazing. And he said, yeah, it was a very big deal that they were doing that. And so part
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.760]   of the problem here, yeah, it's different. Yes, it is commerce. It touches filthy
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:42.360]   liquor, capitalism. Nonetheless, if it helps support the journalism, you think the journalists
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:48.840]   would be nicer to it. Yeah. Well, no, sometimes you have to stand up. I know Stacy, we want to be
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:54.280]   treated better. And that's what they're doing. And so is a boycott is a so so a strike is one thing.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:58.840]   Is a boycott? I'm just asking this question. I don't really have an opinion on it.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:05.480]   A line too far? No. I mean, whenever you go on strike, you say, don't cross the picket line.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:12.360]   Now, with a with a virtual property, there's no picket line to go right go to the wire cutter store.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.960]   So it's just saying, don't cross our picket line. Don't use the wire cutter. Now, it's interesting,
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.640]   because it's not only behind a paywall, although it's a pretty loose paywall. I think you get 10
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:28.120]   articles before you're you're dinged to pay for it. Nevertheless, they also make, and I would bet,
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.400]   the lion's share of the money they make from affiliate fees from their links.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.800]   So I wonder if it even is behind the paywall, because the whole point is that make it is to be
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:42.040]   in the commerce. No, it is. But it's a very it's a loose paywall. Yeah, it's for people like me who
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:49.000]   go in and like read the I actually read the wire cutter for fun. I'm like, I do too. And you know,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.640]   and I pay and I've been paying for 30 years for consumers union for consumer reports. They don't
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.960]   have any advertising. I think it's good to support this cut. This is real journalism.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:03.800]   Should I buy that? Yeah, yeah. And this is of course their biggest weekend because it's Black
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.720]   Friday and Cyber Monday. So they're hitting them. They're hitting the times where it hurts. I'm
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.360]   surprised they couldn't come to an agreement before this strike. It's got to be. They probably,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.120]   I bet mainstream America is not going to know like we know because we're freaking journalists,
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:21.560]   right? But like my mom, no idea. Yeah, actually, she might she might shop just
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:30.280]   despite the unions because she's like somewhat evil sometimes. Yeah. So how do you feel about
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.880]   crypto investors? Boy, the people who tried to buy the Constitution Constitution Dow
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:43.960]   did not work out in so many ways. First of all, they raised 40 million.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:49.720]   But the they kind of got screwed by what they call the gas fees. They were doing it
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:57.000]   in Ethereum. And unfortunately, it's very expensive. I didn't realize how high their gas fees are.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.960]   It's very expensive now. So much so. In fact, there was one journalist. I want to give him credit.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:11.640]   Is it vice? Yeah, it was vice, I think. They bought $200, put $200 into the,
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:19.080]   so I should explain what's going on. Sotheby's last week auctioned off one of the 13 remaining
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:28.200]   print copies of the US Constitution printed in that era. And it went for 43 million to
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:38.680]   ironically a hedge fund CEO, Ken Griffin, who in all ties back in, whose hedge fund was the hedge
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:46.520]   fund that put money into Robinhood during the stock game stop, short sell. So,
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:55.800]   so it's all kind of coming around. And I have to think there was this a little bit of this
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:02.200]   revenge angle in him. So a couple of lessons learned one. It's no good to go into an auction
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.160]   when everybody knows what your top bid is. Yeah. And why Kenneth Griffin offered
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.600]   any more than a dollar more than the top the Dow folks could offer is beyond me. But maybe
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.920]   somebody else was in the bill. A little big swing in there. I could throw in a few extra
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.280]   million. What the hell gotcha you digital.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:27.480]   Nini's. The other thing is you really got to consider the gas fees. So the vice put in 200 bucks
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:33.080]   and effectively you could get a refund, but you have gas fees going in and you had gas fees going
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:40.120]   out. And ultimately a lot of people ended up upside down on their contribution. So now they own.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:46.040]   Oh, and that was another crazy thing. And thank you to vice for for getting this all sorted out.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:56.360]   There were you when you bought into this, you got some purpose created cryptocurrency dollar sign
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:05.480]   people tokens, 1 million tokens per one ether ether a donated. Those tokens were originally going
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.400]   to be here's how we vote on where the Constitution is displayed because they wanted to display it
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:16.360]   to the public at least it. You know, they weren't going to tear it up into 12,000 pieces. There's
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.560]   something like that. There's a million dollar web page. Yeah, right.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:28.600]   Then because they lost the bid, they basically said, oh, the token's worthless.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.920]   People have been trying to sell it. By the way, you're trying to sell their token.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:41.880]   It's just everything wrong with the crypto environment all bundled into one big blob.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.840]   Some people expected to be able to either flip their tiny ownership stake in the
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:53.080]   Constitution. See, anytime you got crypto, you got speculation or the flippers dollar people tokens
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.640]   for a profit. This did start happening over the weekend. According to vice was some investors
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   selling tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. It wasn't against the rules.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:08.280]   Constitutional down. Constitution down said, yeah, that's okay. But then on Saturday,
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:15.400]   this past Saturday, Constitution DAO announced that it would be moving away from the people
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   token to a new yet to be created token called we the people.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:25.880]   And people would go by the wayside because we didn't get the Constitution. And so that was all
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:31.160]   about that. And then a lot of people got upset because it created the price of their
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:38.120]   dollar sign people, hundreds of angry messages on the discord. So then they changed their mind on
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.520]   Sunday night. We're going to go back to the original plan. And now people is
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:47.400]   worth something we're not going to create. We the people. Oh my god.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:52.280]   I have a very fundamental dumb question here, which I tweeted, which is,
[00:59:52.280 --> 01:00:00.600]   the witness have worked on Kickstarter. Yeah, we only put in the money if you actually do this.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.640]   That would have been so much better. We could actually put in fiat currency.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:08.760]   And we wouldn't have any gas. And somebody said back in Twitter, what's that just so webtoon.ogf.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:14.520]   So let me do the, you don't get the speculators, the dumb money that's like, yeah, what the hell?
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:21.400]   Yeah. So this is the process. Vice went through to contribute $200. First, we had to buy a
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.680]   theorem on an exchange. We used Coinbase. We bought $200 worth of Ethereum. Coinbase took a $3 fee.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.280]   Then we had to send the Ethereum from Coinbase to a meta mask crypto wallet. To do this, we had to
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.960]   pay a $12 network fee. Then we had to send the Ethereum from MetaMask to Juicebox, which was
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:44.920]   running the constitutional DAO thing. So called gas fees very wildly, and depend on how busy the
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.800]   Ethereum network is at any given moment in the complexity of the transaction. Right now, gas fees
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.240]   and Ethereum are very high. And a highly complex operation could end up costing hundreds of dollars
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:03.400]   in fees. In our case, they paid a $75 gas fee to contribute roughly $75 to the project of the
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.520]   initial $200 we bought in the ether, $90 was eaten up in fees simply to donate.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.480]   And then if you wanted to get a refund, you have to do that all in reverse.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.080]   So to get our ether back from Juicebox, we'd have to pay gas fees again,
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.760]   meaning essentially the entirety of the amount invested be wiped down. Half of all the people
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:31.160]   contributed are in this boat, according to the Constitution DAO. 17,000 donors, median donation
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.920]   size $206. A significant percentage of these donations came from wallets that were made
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:44.440]   for the very first time. So that's to your point, Jeff. A lot of people go, "Oh, I'm going to get it
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.560]   on this one." That means about half of the people who donated are now going to either lose
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.720]   basically everything they put into a Ethereum network fees. So who gets rich, by the way,
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.800]   same thing with NFTs. Who makes money on NFTs? The people who generate the NFTs,
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.120]   the miners who charge the gas fees. That's who's making money on all this stuff.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:10.520]   Yeah, well, that's not terrible. If you are a creator, then NFTs might be interesting to you,
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.760]   because you can generate NFTs, get the fees. But if you can't sell that NFT,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.280]   you still have to pay the fee to generate it. My point is,
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.000]   there's always going to be a platform. They're the people making the picks for the gold miners.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.840]   And they're going to be in the long run that people are going to make the money, because
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.000]   they make it on every transaction. That's not true. I mean, there will be the few gold miners who
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.040]   make money and some that will make a little money. And then you need picks and shovels. I mean,
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.280]   let's not... Nobody was demonizing the people making picks and shovels back in.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.880]   No. It feels like you're kind of demonizing the platforms here.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:54.120]   Well, it's not the picks and shovels. It's the boat captain who's going to rip you off,
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.000]   getting you up to the gold country. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's fair. I'm just... I'm like,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.040]   I don't know if this metaphor works. I don't think the folks who organized Constitution D.A.O
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   made any money on the gas fees. I don't think so. And in fact, they say it was a victory. If you
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.200]   go to the website, they say this project has been such an incredible experience.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.000]   And we are so honored and appreciative to have been on this journey with you.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.200]   It's like when I fall down and I hop back up and I go, "Tada!"
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:33.000]   This project was a landmark event that showed the entire world that a group of internet friends
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.240]   can use the power of web... There's a lot of money! Web 3. Another buzzword to face is seemingly
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.560]   insurmountable goal and achieve incredible results on an impossible timeline. It is our sincere hope
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:51.080]   that this project will spark many others that take inspiration from the enthusiasm and accomplishments
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.440]   of everyone involved to use the power of Web 3 to make a positive impact on the world. We love
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.720]   you all and are truly humbled to be part of this history together. I think there's a lot of potential
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:08.760]   to crypto and cyber and blockchain, except that it got taken over by a bunch of... Crypto bros.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.440]   Male, male germs. Yeah.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:21.000]   Okay. I don't have a dog in this hunt. I think probably if you bought into this,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.640]   I would hope you didn't expect to get your money back. I mean, what were you going to get if they'd
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.080]   won that you would get nothing? Yeah, exactly. There was no way to get the money back. What
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:36.440]   were you selling? There was no market for it. That's why it was a charitable thing. Start a 501(c)(3),
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.040]   contribute to it and you get a tax deduction. At least you got that. Do you? I guess you do.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.160]   If you make money on crypto... If you don't add to charity, yes.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.480]   But is this a charity? I don't think so. Well, you could have said this is an effort to preserve this
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.800]   for the country. We're going to give it to a university to make sure it doesn't fall in the
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:04.040]   hands of an evil VC or whatever private equity guy. We're going to do it through a physical agent
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.520]   for a charity. Yeah, in that case, you don't get any money back. The only way you make any money
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.920]   in that case back is tax deduction. Right.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   Niantic has raised $300 million, the Pokemon Go folks.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:25.400]   $9 billion valuation. Why? Because they're in the metaverse business.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:36.120]   It's a former Google company. They spun out of Google. I think it was the maps team, wasn't it?
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.040]   They spun out of Google. Their first project was ingress.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   Yeah. And then they did Pokemon Go, which is a huge success. There have been less
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:52.200]   success. Did you do the... Was it Hogwarts? No, Harry Potter? Yeah, they had a good Harry Potter.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.400]   Well, good in the sense that it was Harry Potter. Bad in the sense that it was incredibly boring.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.520]   Yeah, and I stopped playing it. But we still... Lisa is very much still playing Pokemon Go.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.280]   I think a lot of people are. I play it every once in a while. It's fun.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:12.120]   It is fun. You can... I enjoyed it. Yeah. And they're ready. I mean, some of the
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.120]   successes because it's Pokemon, right? But they're ready to... They believe that the metaverse...
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:25.720]   John Hanky, who's the founder, referred to the metaverse, the ones you saw already
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.360]   Player One, the Facebook style VR headsets as a dystopian nightmare.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.800]   Niantic wants to develop technology that brings people closer to the outside world. And that's
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:42.200]   kind of what Pokemon has done. In fact, billions of miles walked by players playing this game
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.080]   because you have to walk around. You can't just sit at home. Well, I think the collection angle
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:52.040]   and the fact that it's not like super skills based and there's a little bit of a... I think
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.960]   there's Pokemon. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah. At Niantic said, "Hanky, we believe humans are the happiest
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.360]   when their virtual world leads them to a physical one." That actually makes sense to me.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:07.560]   Unlike a sci-fi metaverse, a real world metaverse will use technology to improve our experience of
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.000]   the world as we've known it for thousands of years. I agree with him on that. It's exactly my objection
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.400]   to traditional VR is it's isolating. So they... It can't be. Although you can play with other people.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:25.160]   And I would say that Facebook's metaverse does have ways for you to interact with other people
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:30.280]   and wants to bring real people into... Facebook sees it as social. Yeah. Yeah. But I like the idea
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:36.040]   of getting outside and joining the fresh air. Yeah. I'm not going to be against that.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:41.160]   Pokemon Go players have walked 10.9 billion miles in this.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:47.160]   How many times around the earth is that? Lisa goes for a walk every night and I swear to God,
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.960]   she says, "I got to get the sun on my head and I got to feel a pressure."
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.440]   But she's playing Pokemon Go the whole time. I got to leave for a minute. I got to go buy some
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:04.680]   Crocs stock. Jeez. She's out there with her Pokemon ball and her Pokemon Go. It's playing the game
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:10.680]   and it gets her outside. It's great. When we've traveled, we've played it. It's really fun.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.360]   I probably told this story. We were in Malta. In a little island in the middle of the Mediterranean.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:23.560]   And we're in... It's beautiful. Medieval town in downtown Malta and we're playing Pokemon Go.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.640]   And some Maltese kids come over, but they don't speak English. We don't speak Maltese.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:33.720]   And they point at it. We go, "Okay." And we follow them. Probably not the best idea.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.120]   We follow them. We're up and down alleys around. We end up in front of the big cathedral.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.280]   And it turns out they were looking for people to help them in a raid. And so we all played
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:47.720]   together with so much. It was amazing. It was a great, cool experience. That's a cool experience.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:56.840]   So I'm a big fan. The technology is not a bad thing. No. It's a good thing. Well, maybe it's a
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:05.400]   good thing except in the case of mouse jigglers. Well, that's a way to get back at bad evil bosses.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:10.760]   That's true. I, Dick D. Bartolo, had a mouse jiggler on his Gizwey's head when he brings in
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.800]   crappy gadgets for the radio show. And we were both baffled as to the purpose of this thing.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:21.000]   Well, Noah Veltman has explained it. Here's his tweet, "Today in late capitalism, apparently,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.440]   there's a whole product category of mouse jigglers, devices to generate random movement from your
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.400]   mouse so your work from home surveillance software thinks you're working." It's also to keep your
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.760]   computer falling asleep. But maybe it's more fun. Why? Well, people, I mean, I assume people,
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.400]   I mean, if you have a job that needs to get done, the nice thing about working from home is you
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.920]   can get it done and however long a time it takes, right? And then you can go do whatever else.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.120]   It shouldn't be, but bosses. Are we paying for the hour? Are we paying for the hour?
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.880]   That's all bosses are doing. There is. Yeah, there's software now.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.240]   It's really getting awful. I think if you look at the descriptions of these mouse jigglers
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:07.640]   on Amazon, you'll realize that word undetectable shows up in every single description. Undetectable
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:13.960]   mouse mover. I think that tells you what this is for. No one will know that you're
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.680]   they might wonder why is his mouse just kind of jiggling like that? But yeah, that's kind of
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:26.520]   sad if you work for a job like that. By the way, thank you to ScooterX who has posted in our
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:34.360]   Discord Pokemon Go creator, Niantic, launches Bitcoin hunting AR game.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.000]   I'm so confused. Let me see. I got to go to that. Yeah, I got to take that through.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.160]   What do you how? What? I'm going to put it in my browser and find out.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:56.120]   Oh, no, that's not what I wanted. I have a for some reason Firefox when I click a link in
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:04.280]   Discord, it complains. Okay, Chrome squeaks at you. No, it says, are you sure you want to go there?
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.560]   Yes, trust this domain. And then Firefox. Hang out with paranoid people. I'm already running.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:15.160]   Firefox already running to use Firefox. You must first close Firefox.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:24.680]   That's that's kind of Zen, isn't it? If you wish to use Firefox, little grasshopper,
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:31.400]   you must first close Firefox. Here it is. They must have they've announced they're partnering with
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:38.920]   Bitcoin. Rewards application fold to launch a Bitcoin hunting AR game. It's got it's out
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.960]   November 23rd. It launched yesterday in the game. Players will hunt Bitcoin and other prices in the
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:51.720]   wild with their phone. They actually get Bitcoin players will be able to earn satoshis, which by
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.280]   the way is the penny of bitcoins is the smallest possible denomination, but also wins spins that
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.160]   could allow them to earn more, but won't. The rewards will appear on screen as 3D coins and
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:12.920]   other items. You know, I, you know, it might be as fun as playing Pokemon Go. I'm gonna have to find
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:22.840]   this game. What's it called? Does it say? I got a new game. How many Bitcoin?
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:31.000]   I'm just gonna search for Niantic and see. Is anybody playing this?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.240]   No, it's not. It's a bug in Firefox and probably my own Linux. Think somebody's saying,
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.440]   oh, you have an update. No, no, no, no. Go to the terminal. Yeah, I can fix it in the terminal.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:51.080]   Yeah. You know what? I bet you this is not available on iPhone. Come to think of it.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.720]   That's exactly the kind of thing Apple would say. Hey, where's our 30%? Uh-uh.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:01.480]   All right, let's take a little break. More to come. Lots of stories today. We got the change
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.720]   logs still around the corner, but before we go much farther, I'd like to talk to you about
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:14.440]   userway.org. Userway is exactly, this is to me, this is exactly what a company that's trying to
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.280]   make a difference should be doing. So it turns out that according to the federal and the US,
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.640]   the federal ADA law, and I bet there's laws worldwide about this, every website without exception,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:31.880]   has to be accessible. Every website is a public entity. Now that's a challenge, of course,
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.360]   as anybody who owns a website starts thinking about it. How do you know what you need to do?
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.160]   Well, I've got a recommendation. It's very affordable. It's very easy. It's called userway.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:48.920]   Userway is an incredible AI powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.280]   guidelines. And it's just a line, single line of JavaScript you put in your code.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.640]   There's a plug-in for WordPress and other sites. It's very easy. And with that, userway can
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:07.560]   achieve more than an entire team of developers. And look, 1.4 million sites now use userway.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:14.600]   Big businesses like Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, but just because these are best in class
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.800]   enterprise tools doesn't mean you can't use it as a small and medium-sized business. In fact,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.080]   it's very, very affordable. But the nice thing to know is when you take off, when you grow,
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.680]   userway will grow with you. I mean, Coca-Cola can do it. You can.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:35.080]   An accessible and compliant websites, not just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.440]   There are millions of users who can't use your shopping cart or your nav menus or your
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   forms, your registration forms. Millions of people who will require userway just to purchase your
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.280]   products. Userway remediates weird, complex nav menus. It ensures all your pop-ups are accessible.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.680]   It generates image, alts, writes, descriptions for you. That's where the AI comes in and actually
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.560]   can understand the picture and tells people what it is. It fixes vague link violations,
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.920]   broken links, make sure your website uses accessible colors while remaining true to your brand.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.760]   You'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed. Go to userway right now,
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:21.640]   userway.org/twit. They've got a great scanning tool that'll tell you if your website's compliant.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:28.280]   And if it's not, and I bet it's not, it's easy to remediate. You can use WordPress Shopify, Wix,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:33.960]   AEM, Site Course SharePoint. It's cost-effective, easy to add, and it really works. Just ask the

[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   supporting us by using that address so they know it's not here. So somebody said it is on an iPhone.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:41.800]   Fold Bitcoin cashback rewards. No, no, no, no, that's just the fold account thing. That's not,
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.320]   that's not the game. I want the game.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:53.880]   Moving on. Cannabis order is now available on UberEats in Ontario.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.200]   It's kind of great. Perfect. The grass and the munchies come together.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.760]   Yeah. And then you order again because you want more.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:08.600]   It's kind of a virtuous cycle. Yeah. FTC, this is really good. And this
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.000]   article coming from the Neiman Lab. So let's give them credit because of course, great supporters
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.520]   of journalism. Is it the end of click to subscribe but call to cancel? The FTC says,
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:29.320]   that's illegal. Yes. California did this and it was great. So I am glad that the FTC has done this.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:36.120]   And the reason it's in the Neiman Lab website is because a lot of newspapers.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:41.320]   newspapers do this. Yeah. A study of 526 news organizations found that only 41%
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:47.480]   make it easy for people to cancel subscriptions online. And of course, you train your customer
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.680]   service reps in tactics to talk them out of it. That's why you want them to call and make it harder
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:02.840]   to cancel. The FTC says the practice is one of several "they even know about dark patterns"
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:09.480]   quote dark patterns that track, trick or trap customers into subscriptions. And it's straight
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.080]   up illegally FTC vowed to ramp up enforcement. Companies must provide an easy and simple
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:21.400]   cancellation process, including an option that's at least as easy as the one to subscribe.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:28.760]   One click cancel. Wow. This thank you, Lena Kahn. This Lena Kahn had it again.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.000]   She really has her. She's not a fan of big tech to comply with the law.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.640]   She says, this isn't big tech. This is big media. Well, you know what? It's not just media. I mean,
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.880]   every subscript. This is one of the reasons. One of the only reasons I think the iPhone is a
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.160]   superior platform to Android is that anytime you buy anything through Apple, it adds that to a list
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.120]   of subscriptions you can easily find on the iPhone and it makes and you can cancel right there.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:05.000]   And that's part of Apple's rules for subscriptions. And that's a really good thing. I periodically go
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.400]   through it and cancel subscriptions. It's actually good for everybody because if it's easy to cancel,
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:17.320]   you're more likely to try it. Right? Well, and I don't know about you, but I have subscriptions
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:24.520]   that I turn on and off basically, based on a television especially. But even stuff like fitness
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.760]   apps, I get bored. So I'm like, let's do two or three months of Peloton, then let's switch over.
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.680]   Yeah, that's what they're afraid of. Churn is the worst thing they're fighting.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:40.920]   Oh, it's the worst. I'm old enough to remember the industry when presumed renewal through your
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.400]   credit card came along automatic renewal. That was a huge, huge revolution.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:50.520]   So, but churn, okay, just thinking about it logically from a business perspective,
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:55.560]   if you think about churn for like a telco, it's a big deal because if got a lay lines or give you
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:01.080]   hardware, even a media publication has to say, hey, I've got X number subscribers. Thus, I'm going
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:06.840]   to pay real money to print physical copies of the paper and mail them out, right? As you move to
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:14.520]   digital turning things on and off is actually pretty easy and it's not expensive if your software
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.720]   works correctly. But your real cost. So that is, go ahead, sir.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:23.240]   That's what I'm saying. So I understand the business model logic here, but the actual real
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.600]   costs of it are pretty low, which means eventually they will, unless there's a monopoly, they will
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:35.000]   move to doing that because there's no reason not to. Here's the thing. Some of them will make it easier.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   It's not a switch on and off. What do you call it when you start a phone line?
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:50.520]   Connect, disconnect? Well, whatever. Yeah. So provision on provision. It's not a provision
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.640]   question. Thank you. To use the jargon. It's a marketing question. So how much do you think it
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.080]   costs to market to get a new subscriber to entertain weekly back in my days?
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:10.920]   No, that's true. But even the cost of marketing is lower. Not necessarily because it's harder to
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:16.920]   get people. And it depends on what the cost of the item is. When I work for Delphi Internet way
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:21.560]   back in the day, the subscriber-assision cost was like $108. It was huge.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:28.280]   Okay. Well, and then yes, I mean, I get why people don't want people to stop paying the money
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:36.920]   every month. But I also get flipping things back on and off in the digital world is way different
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.440]   than flipping it back on and off in the physical world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:47.000]   your provision. In provision sense, you're right. Yes. Yes. But yes. Yes. There's marketing expense.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.760]   I mean, if you're a newspaper, there's all the journalists you hire. I mean, there's a
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:58.440]   good solution for that, actually. The New York Times had AI write the book review for a book
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.720]   that I don't think anybody wants to read. The Age of AI in our human future by Henry Kissinger,
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:09.320]   Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Hootenlocker, and I'm thinking Hootenlocker probably did all the writing
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:17.720]   on this one. The reviewer, Kevin Rus, we all know, love him, said after finishing the age of AI,
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:23.640]   a new book about artificial intelligence by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Hootenlocker,
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:29.560]   I found myself unmoved by the prospect of reviewing it. I've read dozens of books about AI, and while
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:36.120]   the conceit of this one was intriguing, bringing together a 98 year old diplomat and a war criminal,
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.720]   a former Google that was me. I added that a former Google chief executive and an MIT professor,
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:49.000]   the book itself was a fairly forgettable entry in the genre. So he got GPT-3.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   I didn't know about this pseudo-write. S-U-D-O-write is an AI writing program that uses GPT-3.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.240]   I remember reading that OpenAI was reluctant to release GPT-3 because it was too good.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.560]   I don't know if that's the case. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you get to the first cut below?
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.280]   So it does this with the help of a supercomputer containing some 285,000 processors, a multi-layered
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:24.760]   neural network that ranks among the world's most powerful AI engines. In fact, it's even
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:29.880]   mentioned in the book, The Age of AI, is one of several promising technologies that are producing
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.000]   a revolution in... I mean, he marries more like...
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.920]   Nobody's a revolution around revolution than in human affairs. Come over here, please.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.840]   I pasted the first several paragraphs of this review into pseudo-write and asked the AI to
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.520]   finish. Here's what it wrote. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Hootenlocker, I just
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:56.200]   like saying his name. That's why I keep reading it. The Age of AI is a bold new book on artificial
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:01.560]   intelligence that will become a go-to guide for anyone who wants to understand this transformative
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:05.960]   technology. It's as if the AI knew. It's like...
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.240]   It's about the B.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:14.200]   AI log-rolling here. The authors have examined the full range of AI technologies from
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.520]   computer-viewed revision systems to natural language processing and written about them in a way
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.800]   that will appeal to both experts and lay people. I mean, honestly, it does sound like a human wrote
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.760]   this kind of a PR human.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:32.840]   Human. Yeah. One of the most inspiring aspects of this book is its scope. The authors tell
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.520]   of... What a wonderful meeting with the statement.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.880]   Into the potential of AI in all areas of human enterprise that describe the impact of AI in
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:45.240]   healthcare, economics, geopolitics, law, urban development, governance, journalism, the military,
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.680]   even the likes... Are we out of 100 words yet? Do I have to keep going?
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.640]   Yeah, this sounds like what I used to write in the high school.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:25:00.280]   The high school paper. Kissinger, Schmidt, and Hootenlocker are not afraid to explore the darkest side of AI,
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.200]   either. They are clear-eyed about the ways that AI could enable dictators to monitor their citizens
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.520]   and manipulate... Ooh, my best friends. Yeah, to incite people to commit violence. Ooh, that's
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:15.480]   interesting. Although AI is already making our lives better in many ways, Kissinger, Schmidt,
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.480]   and Hootenlocker, clearly GPT-3 enjoys his name as well, caution that it will take us as a species
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:27.160]   many years to create a system as powerful as we deserve. So why do I create a bunch of
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:33.240]   meaningless blather? They wisely suggest we not lose sight of the values we want to instill
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:39.160]   in this new machine, intelligence... You know, look, it's got to a high school level.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.200]   Yeah, it did. Pretty good. Now read the earlier try.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.760]   Oh. Yeah, it's hilarious. That was the best try. On the first attempt, it spent on a series
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.840]   of run-out sentences that hinted GPT-3 stuck at some kind of odd recursive loop.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:02.360]   As an example, the book which you are reading at the moment is a book... A book on a nook,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:09.320]   which is a book on a book, which is a book on a subject, which is a subject on a subject.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:17.800]   What? Yeah. When it goes wrong, it goes wrong so hilariously. It's Dr. Zeus, the book which
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.840]   you're reading at the moment is a book on a nook, which is a book on a book, which is a book on a
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.800]   subject, which is a subject on a subject, which is a subject on a subject. A few tries later,
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.640]   it seemed to give up on the task of book reviewing altogether and starting merely listing the names
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.160]   of tech companies. Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Python, Tencent, Tesla, Uber,
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.280]   B&B, Twitter, Snap, Alibaba, We Check, Slack.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:50.840]   But it warmed up quickly and within a few minutes, the AI was coming up with impressively cogent
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:57.480]   paragraphs of analysis, some frankly better than, says Mr. Zeus, what I could have generated on my own.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:04.920]   Well done, Kevin. Well done. Yeah, well played.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:10.280]   So, let's see, what should he have been paid for writing that article if he had turned that in?
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.640]   And is it art if a journalist makes an AI write him a story?
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:19.000]   It's art because of the way he made it very much more interesting story than a review of this
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.720]   Dopey book would have been. Yeah, absolutely. I agree.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.800]   Yeah. I mean, that's where that's the art. He says, "Finally, GPT-3 did not address the
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.520]   biggest question about the book, which is why it exists at all." Kissinger, who was 66 years old
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:40.680]   when the World Wide Web was invented, is not a full-time AI practitioner, nor a particularly
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:47.800]   savvy parser of tech hype. Remember, he was on the board of Theranos. So anyway,
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:57.080]   yeah, you know what? Wasn't on the board of Theranos. I mean, not me. I was not.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:05.880]   Trials get interesting now. I think Elizabeth Holmes is on the stand this week.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.560]   Yes, she has been on the stand. I have not. Have you followed the case? I haven't. Really?
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.440]   Yeah, you know, and it's gotten more and more damning as it's gone on. I mean, essentially,
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.440]   we were told that the strategy was going to be because they separated the trials of Elizabeth
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:26.120]   Holmes, the founder, and the man who was at the time hurt not only her paramour, but also ran the
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:33.080]   company Sonny Bolani. Those trials were separated. His trials later is next year that it was thought
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:39.800]   that each trial would be each defendant blaming the other one for everything. And it's kind of what
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   happened is, you know, but they've been bringing in a parade of people who are saying, "Well,
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:51.320]   they didn't put it in writing, but here's what they told me." And it was all BS. Finally, last week,
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:58.360]   they had the recordings for reporters interview with Elizabeth Holmes in which she repeated
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.800]   all of the lies and misdirections that she had told the investors they got it on tape.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:10.680]   So I think that's kind of blockbuster. And she can't really say, "Well, it's Sonny's fault." He
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.640]   said that, not me, because they got her on tape saying it. I haven't read her testimony yet. It'll
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:21.800]   be interesting to see what she says. All I saw was the tick-tock of her holding hands with her
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:27.560]   a current romantic partner and her mother walking to the court and some guy in the background saying,
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:35.880]   "You go, girl, boss!" That's all I have. "You go, girl, boss. You tell him."
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:45.160]   That's a good way to put it. California. So one of my favorite authors, Stacey Higginbotham,
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:50.760]   wrote a piece called "The Unbearable Fussiness of the Smart Home," finally admitting what we've
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:58.120]   known for years. Tell us... That's me. That's you. Tell us about your tale of woe.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.880]   Yeah. And we talk about how the smart home all the time is not smart enough, right? And I've
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:10.600]   finally decided to break down... Tell the truth. I use examples. I mean, I talk about it being
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:16.200]   messy all the time. I mean, I don't... There's no reason to lie to people about that. I don't sugar
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:22.920]   coated. Let me give you... The smart home, this is one quote, is like a cat, mostly self-sufficient
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:28.120]   and nice to have, but also possessing a mind of its own that can lead to frustration and confusion
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.000]   for its owner. I think that's a perfect analogy. Sometimes it's easy. So I followed...
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.760]   Yeah. I followed things that broke in my house and as examples. And basically, the whole point of
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.480]   this article is you are no longer buying hardware, even though you think you're buying hardware.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.800]   You're buying software. And you're not only buying software, you're buying
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:55.160]   independent or interdependent software and services from different vendors.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:03.160]   And it's... It just constantly degrades. You cannot get a device that's going to consistently,
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.360]   if you hook it up to anything else, an update might break it. A new feature role might break it.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:13.320]   All kind of... You never know. And so I just kind of wrote this. I didn't think it would...
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.400]   It's done very well. I was kind of like, "Oh, fine. I'm just writing this because I'm just
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.640]   saying it's an analogy flight stone." You got picked up 11 hours ago by Hacker News,
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:31.400]   288 comments. All of them pretty much agreeing with you. A lot of reinforcement. I think...
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.280]   There's always the guy said, "Well, I'm no one have those problems." But...
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:41.080]   Yeah. There's all the... There's a subset of people. There's the...
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.680]   This is why I never put any of this stuff in my house to begin with.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.200]   There's the... You would never have this problem if you installed...
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.200]   Open source. Yeah. Open source.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.280]   Home-seer, when you pick... You know, CDN, whatever. Professional installer, whatever.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:59.240]   And then there's the people who are like, "Yeah, this does suck." And who actually
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:05.640]   recognized that it's a problem. And this isn't just a problem for the smart home industry.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:10.360]   It's a problem for consumers. It's a problem for manufacturers. And it's going to be a legal
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:19.240]   problem because we, like I said, everybody's hardware. Your car, your corporate, I don't know,
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:25.880]   manufacturing machines. They're all becoming software. And software has different ownership
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:31.800]   require or different requirements by the manufacturers, like different obligations for
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:36.840]   security and things like that. And it has a different product for the... It's a different product for
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:42.120]   the consumer. And we don't realize that. There's a good story, actually, this week from
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:48.520]   Ars Technica on people buying the Nordic track. Something something... Oh, yeah. And hacking it.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.040]   Yeah. And hacking it. And then Nordic track... So they watch Netflix.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:57.160]   Yeah. They have to... They were like, "This thing has a 32-inch screen on it. I love it. I'm
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:03.240]   going to hack it. It's already based Android. We'll just sideload Netflix, YouTube, and whatever we want."
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.920]   And apparently Nordic track was like, "You know what? We're going to update this. It's too
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:13.880]   easy to sideload stuff." And maybe Nordic track didn't realize it was breaking a critical
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:19.640]   functionality that people loved. But Nordic track didn't offer it as a formal functionality. So,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.560]   from their perspective, they're cutting in the clear. And maybe they want to do a business model
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:29.400]   where they do a deal with YouTube for exclusive access. I mean, these are the sorts of things where
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:36.360]   a lot of the conflict about the stuff we're buying today is conflicts about, is it hardware or software?
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:42.440]   Well, and more, even more, it's often you own the hardware, but you don't own the software.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:47.960]   And so, as a result, you don't really own the device. You don't control it. And it's not just
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:55.160]   home automation. Everything's... It's your car. It's your car. It's your John Deere Combine.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:02.200]   My favorite comment in the Hacker News thread from Brian Rasmussen, very simple, "There will come
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:08.280]   soft rains," which if you're a Ray Bradbury fan, you know exactly what they're referring to.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.760]   Is that from the Velt or is that actually the name of the story I'm trying to remember?
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.520]   You should tell everyone who doesn't know that story.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:21.640]   Well, the Velt is a great example. Let's see. Oh, yeah. There will come soft rains
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:29.960]   is the story. And it's after the nuclear meltdown, there's nothing left except the automated devices,
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:37.880]   which continue to operate forever. If you're not a Ray Bradbury fan, you got to read some...
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:43.960]   You got to read some Ray Bradbury fan. If you're not a Ray Bradbury fan, why not? Yeah,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:50.760]   why not? Exactly. There will come soft rains. What a great, simple comment to add. Yeah.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:57.320]   Yeah. So, I mean, look, the fact that you got not only picked up on Hacker News, but
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.560]   20088 comments shows that you touched a nerve. You definitely touched a nerve. This is something
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:09.800]   we're all experiencing. Pete Warden retweeted it, and I think he's just the best. So he's the
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:17.720]   tiny ML dude at Google. Nice. I love his worldview. Nice. So, for me, it was a little bit of an antidote,
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.400]   because you're always talking about how much you love your nano leaf elements and your
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.040]   your wemo remote stuff to know that it's just as bad for you as it is for me.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:34.600]   Like, I have the only problem. Like, I'm trying to think of the few problem-free devices. And a
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:40.600]   lot of the problems come in, like the nano leaf issue was an update that broke my system,
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:46.920]   and I'm still waiting to get it fixed. The wemo stuff is... That is like a weird ghost between
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.360]   Google and wemo. They have like these... I think I called it this ebb and flow of like
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.680]   working and non-working that's so hilarious to me. I just... It's like living in a haunted house,
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:04.200]   because like, sometimes it ate my lights will turn off like they're supposed to, but sometimes
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.360]   they won't. And I never know what's going to happen. Apparently, enrages your husband.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:16.360]   Oh yeah, he is. He's just... He's like, "Hey, gee, turn on the plants. Turn on the plants.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.240]   Stacy, it's broken." I'm like, "No, it's just not working this week." He's like, "Ugh."
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:28.440]   This week. I was like, "Give it a couple days." This week. That's my favorite. It does. It does.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.840]   It does. It says it's so fun. Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:36.680]   Actually, you know what? We're going to give you a reward, Stacy, for your excellent article,
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:43.400]   because there are now some pretty strong rumors about the Pixel 6G.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:53.400]   Oh wait, no, no. 6A, I mean... What did you buy? I bought a 5 on Swappa.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:59.640]   And you know what? I love it. I don't know. It was like $400, maybe three...
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.360]   There you go. And it has a headphone jack. I use a 400 dollar.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.760]   Which is... Has a headphone jack? Yeah, because the rumors of the Pixel 6A say no headphone jack,
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.480]   but it is smaller and lighter. But probably not as small and light as a 5A.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:17.880]   Well, if had I known, but I had to return my Google, Google has the crappiest return policy on
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.840]   all this. It's 15 days. So I had to... I wanted something.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.560]   So you're happy with the 5A. And I got a cool camel case. Look at that.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:33.560]   It's like... I'm like a finance player. For those who missed last week's episode, the
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:42.600]   self-titled Princess Floppy Rists episode, Stacey did not... And I met that in only the most loving way.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.680]   I did not take it as... I thought it was... No, you laughed hardly at it.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:55.800]   Yes. I enjoyed the princess. I was like, yes. Stacey was not happy with the weight and heft of her
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.600]   Pixel 6 Pro. I'm glad to see that you found something good. And you know, I think,
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.080]   honestly, except for the cameras, they're probably pretty comparable. And you do...
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.400]   Yeah. And I'll look at the 6. Maybe I'll get that. And you know, my daughter can have the 5 and
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:15.400]   she won't have like... I just... I don't love this. I wasn't as... Like, I was genuinely excited to
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:21.720]   upgrade to the Pixel 6. But no. I mean, it was... I mean, this is not exciting. It's functional,
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.080]   because my other phone was kind of getting real laggy. So...
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.520]   I'm using myself with visions of why Stacey couldn't be Queen Elizabeth.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.480]   [Laughter]
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:38.040]   I can't wave! I can't wave! Now, you were having trouble, Jeff, with your Pixel 6 and your Android
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:44.200]   Honor. Yes. So I... And I was... I'm honored. I am absolutely honored that I was the celebrity
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.360]   letter of the week on all about Android with its host, Peter G. Krebs.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.120]   [Laughter]
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.840]   Ooh. Ooh.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.760]   So...
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.440]   The beer's working. He's getting a little weird. He's doing mofam buries.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.160]   You grow a beer.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.240]   And your decision to show that, yeah.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.960]   Just to support this testicles. Yeah. I want to see... We want to do this selfie. So Jason,
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.920]   put up selfie up, will you? So the problem is...
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.880]   You can just watch all about Android.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.560]   Well, I was going to say, I want to see it at the end of the month. I want to wait till,
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.520]   you know, next week.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.480]   That's pretty darn close.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.520]   [Laughter]
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.000]   Okay.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.520]   We only get another week.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.080]   We get there.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:22.360]   Yeah, I don't think it's going to be a lot more...
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.040]   [Laughter]
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.040]   Oh, okay. Well, I was like, maybe there's more growth.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.040]   [Laughter]
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.840]   Not unless he takes a lot of hormones between now and Monday.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.400]   What did it mean?
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.280]   You're a G-Crib where...
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.240]   Did Krebs wear it?
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.680]   Did he wear a Beret? He was a...
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.320]   No.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.640]   I don't think so. He had a Gotee.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:37.880]   Right.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.720]   He was, of course, we're talking about Dobi Gillis, which is the show he even
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.360]   refered for me.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.240]   Dobi, yes.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:43.640]   Yes.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.520]   But I loved it.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.000]   So...
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.480]   All right.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.800]   And it was Gila again who played
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.840]   Mater G Krebs.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.800]   Yes.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.040]   And...
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.880]   There's a certain...
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.280]   Certain similarity.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   [Laughter]
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.640]   Oh, it was Bongo's. That's right.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   You need some Bongo's...
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.360]   Jason, that would do it.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.360]   Are they a Toren sweatshirt?
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.720]   Toren sweatshirt.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.040]   Work!
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.360]   Mater G Krebs used to say that all the time.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:10.760]   Work!
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.640]   This is what network television thought of hippies or beatnicks.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:16.200]   Exactly.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:16.760]   Beatnicks.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.160]   Beatnicks.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.720]   [Laughter]
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.280]   Um...
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:20.600]   All right.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.400]   Well, anyway, so...
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:21.880]   No.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:21.880]   No.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.360]   No.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:22.680]   Sorry.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.160]   We need to make my phone.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:23.480]   Phone.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.280]   We got to talk to you.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:24.600]   I need help here.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.040]   Talk about your Android.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.080]   So I...
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.200]   In response to you...
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.640]   Yeah, yours was no cut.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.200]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.320]   [Laughter]
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.680]   I pointed out that Android Auto did not work
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.440]   if you have a VPN or I was using next DNS.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.360]   If you had a VPN of any kind turned on,
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.440]   or express VPN.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.200]   So I turned it off and it works just fine.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.680]   I even sent you a proof of concept picture.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:47.640]   To rub my nose at the front.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.920]   To rub my nose in it.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.400]   But maybe that's because I have a Ford.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.440]   I don't know, but it doesn't...
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.320]   So others are reporting these problems.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.520]   Lots of problems.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.840]   So what's happening is it'll recognize the phone.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.200]   It'll recognize there's Android Auto.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.160]   But when I click on Android Auto on the head unit,
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.400]   on the car, it doesn't do anything.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.600]   It can't get anything out of the phone.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.400]   I think it's what's happening.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.640]   The phone's not responding.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.840]   And so nothing happens.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.240]   And Ron said that what he had heard on all about Android,
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.120]   he'd heard that there were issues with lots of different cars.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.160]   And I also heard in Twitter that maybe it's the cable.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.480]   It's very persnickety.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.200]   Oh, that could be.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.560]   So I'm using wireless Android Auto.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.120]   I can't.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:36.840]   There's no such thing.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.880]   Yeah, yeah, you have to have it.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.000]   But maybe that's why I can use it and you can't.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.240]   So I'm trying to be calm here and not have a signal.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.160]   Are you using a cable that came with the phone?
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:49.640]   Try that.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.120]   It's C to C.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.040]   Oh, and you don't have to see it.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:54.440]   A.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.560]   Oh, there's the car.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:55.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.480]   It's the car.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.160]   So the truck is about 40 years behind.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.800]   That's right.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.240]   So, yeah, so I had a hellish week trying to get my,
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.320]   I decided to upgrade my files.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.440]   My files was working.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.520]   It was working beautifully for a whole lot.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:10.600]   Oh, man.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.760]   These tweets burned my eyeballs.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.200]   They were so angry.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.160]   Mess with it.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.560]   And finally, a nice guy named Frank was here for four and a half hours.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:20.280]   This is important.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.560]   It says he just goes to your point, I think,
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.120]   about the persnickiness of these things.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:31.880]   You know, we're like one old, um, uh, uh, splitter that wasn't up to the right number
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.720]   on it and that caused two to go down and something else caused others to go down.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.640]   And he said, yeah, these are a lot touchier.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.440]   He said to have boxes are the worst computers ever created.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.480]   They're just awful.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.040]   So anyway, so I got through all that.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.800]   And I said, I can't take another crisis.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.720]   I'm just going to tell myself to be calm.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.320]   I can still use my car.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.080]   I can still use my phone.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.440]   I hope Google will fix it.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.600]   Zen breath chat.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.320]   Zen breath.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.480]   So I'm pissed about it, but I'm trying not to get upset about it.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.680]   All that I'd remember was looking.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.240]   Really?
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.200]   Let me know.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:02.920]   I wasn't alone.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:07.480]   Oh, I can, I'm a hair, hair trigger away from a psycho fit, but I'm trying not here.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.000]   Jason has like, you seemed pretty.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.360]   Jason has tweeted a picture of his, um, incipient beard.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.200]   nascent nascent beard.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.640]   Oh, it came in just it came in so nicely down there.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.600]   It's so cute.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.280]   It's so cute.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.800]   But it, but it is better.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.600]   G crabs, right?
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:28.840]   He's a beat Nick.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.880]   Little gray in there too.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.240]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.000]   Oh, Jason's a good looking fella.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.240]   And, uh, that's a nice beard.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:41.720]   He said his wife is saying at the moment of the tick of the clock and the new month.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.920]   It's going.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.960]   Oh, yeah, that's why I can't do it.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.080]   Cause at least it wouldn't, it won't let me just fall out.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.400]   Won't let me, which is fine.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.760]   Cause I think in my business, honestly, it's better not to have a beard because you want to,
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.600]   you want to get as much expressiveness.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.200]   You know, you want all the emotions and.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.240]   No, I think some people, like if you have a bad chin, you want a beard.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.400]   Well, there's cause.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.200]   Not a bad chin.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:08.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.080]   If you have a weak chin, I think my chin's good.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.160]   So, so my accused of having a weak chin or not being expressive enough right now.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.400]   Well, yeah, I mean, a go T's in too bad cause it's still a lot of your faces exposed, but.
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.600]   I also think it's a strong statement.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.320]   Like, uh, well, just, it's just a statement.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:32.440]   It's like people go go T and so I'm trying to be as neutral as possible.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:36.280]   Right.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:36.760]   Joy.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:37.320]   Go T.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.080]   No, no, you make, don't you look at somebody.
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.360]   I mean, when you see somebody with a beard, you pigeonhole them.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.640]   That's a Santa Claus.
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.440]   That's a major G.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:44.840]   Cribs.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.040]   You did it yourself, Jeff.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:49.080]   It's a, there's something because a beard, you see that.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.200]   You're the love and fun.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.160]   All right.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:45:00.200]   Did you see the, actually the Android police story that said your pixel five could have been
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:05.080]   a contender if they'd only had the tensor chip they had planned.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.360]   They had planned to put the tensor chip in the five, but they, it wasn't ready.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:17.880]   And according to Marquez Brownlee, he had conversations with people at Google saying the
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.960]   company had been working on tensor for a long time.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.640]   They wanted the pixel five to be the first phone to launch with it,
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.080]   but because of COVID-19 and supply chain obstacles, this would explain why they were a
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.560]   little bit lackluster in promoting the pixel five.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.400]   They were a little disappointed.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.160]   Like, put a dog in our homework.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.360]   They put a snapdragon into it at the last minute.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.400]   So that, that, that kind of explains because there was definitely this lack of energy around
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.200]   the pixel five.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.400]   I mean, I'm not even excited to have it.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:51.880]   I mean, seriously, I'm just like, it's a phone.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:55.240]   I mean, but poems are pretty utilitarian now for me anyway.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.320]   I used to get excited, but who cares now?
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:02.200]   Should we do a change log?
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.760]   Because we're getting close to the end of this program.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.920]   It's pretty light this week, according to main energy crabs.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.440]   So just a word of warning.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.280]   Play the drums.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.640]   The Google change log.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:26.680]   Mac rumors rejoices that as soon as Google messages is updated, which should be happening
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:34.520]   soon on most Google phones, no longer will you get that kind of pathetic user like to your
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.560]   message, you'll actually get a happy, go lucky thumbs up an emoji reaction.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.080]   We're starting to see it already in Google messages.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.720]   If you get an iMessage from an Apple user and the world's,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.760]   world's entire message anymore, it still does a message, but it will add the thumbs up.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.280]   It'll look a lot more like it looks on the iPhone on the iPhone.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.120]   So what these are message reactions.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:03.000]   So I have the message and if I, you know, a lot of times people say, well, see at five,
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.200]   I don't respond to it.
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.760]   I just put a thumbs, I long press it, put a thumbs up on it.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:14.920]   I guess I could, I could give a thumbs up to, I don't know, my mom saying, let's FaceTime now.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:17.400]   She's going to be, she can be really confused by this.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.920]   I'm going to do a thumbs up, right?
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.360]   Now, because she's on an iPhone, she's called me.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.000]   Yeah, I know.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:25.560]   Why is this?
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.360]   You didn't want to call.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.200]   You said we were going to FaceTime.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:31.560]   So I did FaceTime or yesterday, but that's what this message is from.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.480]   So I hope that FaceTime is right now.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.360]   I'd love to meet mom.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.080]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:35.960]   Oh, you haven't met her?
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.560]   Yeah, she's great.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.040]   So now it puts that thumbs up on there, which is a way of acknowledging it.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.120]   And it used to be on Android messages.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.680]   If it was an Android person, they'd see something like Leo liked your message in text.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.760]   No, what it would do is it would say heart and then would repeat the entire message.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.480]   Oh, it would.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.880]   Oh, it's really irritating.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:58.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:04.920]   So now it's going to have the thumbs up, but it will also pop up,
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.400]   which is unfortunate.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.920]   A message saying translated from iPhone, which is really annoying.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:18.040]   So Google Givith and Google take it away.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:23.720]   Black Friday deals now live in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.160]   These are the deals we actually talked about.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:29.480]   I don't know.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:34.280]   I can't speak to the Australian deals, but some really, really good deals.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.320]   In fact, I'm very tempted.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:42.840]   We talked about this last week to get this Google Nest speaker, because there's $50 off.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:48.200]   The Nest Hub Max, which I really like is down $50 as well.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:55.720]   So these are all Black Friday deals at the Google Store, 30 bucks, 50 bucks.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.320]   I think this is fairly good savings.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.000]   I don't know a lot of Google things.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:48:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.600]   I mean, I was kind of sad, like, had I bought my pixel and kept it.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.160]   I would have been like.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:08.760]   Earbuds or something, right?
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.480]   Now it looks like you get an extra pair if you want them.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.440]   Oh, I took those.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:17.000]   I canceled my earbud order since I returned the phone.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:17.240]   Right.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.520]   Right.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.080]   They sent me the earbuds before I got the phone.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.320]   Oh.
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:23.960]   So then I wasn't allowed to return when I turned the phone.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.880]   The Nest, I think the best thing on the phone anyway.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.680]   The Nest Audio, which normally $100 is down to 60 bucks.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.880]   Nest Thermostat, that 100 bucks is some good deals.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.400]   Those are some good deals if you want those particular.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.040]   I would run out and buy them just because you got a deal on them.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.200]   But that's the problem with Black Friday deals in general.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.920]   Well, it's like, okay.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.200]   Well, no, I'm not going to talk about this.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.080]   I've already been made fun of for my slippers.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:49.640]   So.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.320]   Oh, I'm not making fun of your slippers.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.800]   I sound like you had a cult of people following you in little fuzzy letters.
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:02.200]   Everything's being should send us a check for all the slippers they probably sold because of you.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:03.800]   Okay.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.320]   Google Stadia.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.280]   I'm not sure I'd buy into Stadia right at this moment.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:15.720]   Two years old, they're celebrating with inexpensive or free hardware.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:20.680]   It's really software and it might break.
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.080]   But if it's free, I guess, sure.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.280]   You can now buy the Stadia Premier Edition hardware kit,
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:31.080]   which actually comes with a Chromecast Ultra, which is good.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:37.880]   And the Stadia controller for just $22.22 because it's their second anniversary.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:44.760]   Or get one free when you purchase a $30 or higher game in the Stadia store until November 29th.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:51.960]   I, you know, I'm not sure I could recommend buying Stadia at this point.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.960]   It seems like it's a strong one.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:54.760]   A little bit.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:57.160]   And I did do this.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.840]   You can pre-order the second generation Pixel Stand.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.520]   It won't ship until next month.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.920]   I actually ordered it.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.440]   I have the old Pixel Stand.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.080]   This is $79.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:14.600]   It's designed for the Pixel with a custom stand UI on the screen of your phone.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.240]   So you can control audio, adjust smart home devices.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:22.440]   And at the bottom, you can select quiet or performance charging modes.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:26.600]   The stand actually has a fan in it to keep it cool.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.400]   Yes.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.000]   While it's doing fast charging.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.600]   It looks kind of nice.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:37.080]   Did you see that the Pixel 6 doesn't charge at 20 or at 30 watts?
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.280]   Yeah, it's 22.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.920]   Well, that's what you were complaining about, Jeff.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:43.640]   Or no.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.600]   Was Paul Thoreau?
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.880]   Paul Thoreau was complaining about it.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.560]   No, but was that one complaint I didn't have?
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.280]   Yeah, he was complaining.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.440]   Oh, it takes two whole hours to charge up.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.040]   And it's like, oh, gee, however, will you live?
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.880]   That's actually, I mean, that's kind of a long way to fast.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.920]   Well, it's long compared to things like the OnePlus, I guess.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.840]   Super fast.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.960]   My Pixel.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:05.480]   I was using the Pixel 2 because that's the oldest phone we have.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:08.440]   Well, because there was like a two day lapse between pixels.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:12.040]   And that thing charged at no time,
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.640]   probably because there wasn't much going on in it.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.720]   That's a smaller battery.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.480]   It's good though, because the battery is sold.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.800]   It was like, you have used me for an hour.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.160]   We're back at zero.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:25.400]   The new Pixel stand has, and I'm quoting Google here,
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.480]   approximately 39% recycled materials.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.520]   Why would you say approximately and then give such an oddly precise percentage?
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.040]   Because we're probably wrong about it anyway.
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.680]   So now I'm wondering, well, what is it really?
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.040]   All right, I always ordered these.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:42.440]   I don't know why.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.400]   We think.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:43.880]   We think.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:44.840]   Something like.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:45.320]   We hope.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.200]   Something like maybe.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:46.680]   Maybe.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.640]   Yeah, it only goes up to 23 watts for a compatible Pixel phone.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:53.000]   That's fast though for wireless charging, which is.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:53.800]   Wireless charging.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.560]   But the wired is not.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:01.560]   Apparently, you shouldn't buy one of those fancy high wattage charger
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:05.880]   wall warters because you won't get the benefit of it on a Pixel.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.800]   And that is the Google change.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:16.280]   Samsung is going to build its factory in.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.440]   Taylor, Texas?
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.240]   Tyler, Texas.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.360]   17.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:20.840]   Taylor.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:21.480]   Taylor.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:22.680]   Oh, Taylor's not Tyler.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:24.840]   No, Tyler's by Dallas.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:25.880]   Taylor's by Austin.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:27.480]   You know it.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.080]   I do.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:29.800]   Seven.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:30.280]   You know it.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.480]   Well, actually, that's a good place.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.080]   Austin's a tech quarter.
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:36.360]   17 billion dollar chip making factory.
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.040]   Yeah, it's only like 20 or 30 miles from Samsung's Austin fab.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.360]   So they already have a fab down there.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:47.480]   Yeah, they have a 300 millimeter one where they mix Exynos chips, actually.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.600]   It's a good fab.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.960]   I wonder what they're going to do in this one.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:54.920]   Probably make 300 millimeter other fancy chips.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:02.600]   Our longtime sponsor Casper, which had a kind of,
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.640]   not a great IPO in the stock's been going down.
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:07.560]   They decided to go private.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.120]   They're buying back all their stock.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:21.320]   When it listed, it sold its stock for $10 to share, rising above $15 per share early,
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:25.000]   then going down to $3.18 a share more recently.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.320]   They're offering $6.90 a share.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.560]   That's a 94% premium to the closing price on November 12th.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.440]   I'm rooting for them.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.880]   I love my Casper mattresses.
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:40.920]   And they were, I think the first mattress in a box company,
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.480]   they've been advertising for a long time with us.
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:49.240]   The problem is it got to be a very crowded category.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.240]   Well, and it's a pretty niche market.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:55:00.440]   Well, if you go down the streets of Main Street, USA, any town USA,
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.760]   you'll see mattress store after mattress store.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:03.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.080]   So there must be some money in that.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.640]   So people don't buy that.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.720]   Apparently mattresses are somewhat of an impulse purchase for a lot of people.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:11.960]   What?
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.720]   So they actually designed, there's a whole article on this where you're like,
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.160]   "Oh, I need to get a mattress."
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:21.480]   And then you see one and you're like, "I guess today's a good day."
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.840]   So they try to stagger them so they're easy to act.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.440]   They're like McDonald's, right?
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.800]   You have to be able to enter it.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:28.840]   They're like a Starbucks.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.600]   You want to quickly run in and get a mattress.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.160]   I think it's weird, but I sure, I guess.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.640]   I just don't feel like it should be an impulse purchase, but okay.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.280]   Well, impulse is probably, it's just like you don't plan to go to the mattress store.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.080]   You're like, "You need a mattress.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:48.280]   You'll deal with it.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.280]   You don't usually break your mattress.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.240]   You're just kind of, it's a feeling that grows over time."
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.280]   And then this guy named Jeff Jarvis put a poll up on Twitter.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:01.720]   He said, "The New York Times treats the iPhone as a luxury.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.600]   I hate to break it to them, but I think many people would say that these days,
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.400]   the subscription to the Times is a luxury.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:10.680]   It costs you $1,000 a year for the New York Times."
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:13.240]   If you go full rate to get home delivery, that's where I am.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:13.560]   Wow.
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.560]   That's why I just get to some new times.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.160]   So the Times itself was saying that,
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.720]   "What's the real cost of upgrading your phone?
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.680]   $1,000."
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:23.320]   That's what it's called as a version cost.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.960]   Yeah, but the New York Times, you get a newspaper every day.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:28.520]   But you only get a one for one year at that rate.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:29.880]   I've owned last year for four years.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:31.320]   Oh, very good point.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.360]   How's that poll going?
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:35.800]   Oh, it's stupid, but I just do it to give you a mattress.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.400]   Just angry.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.760]   Which is more of an necessity.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.960]   A phone or a newspaper?
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.080]   Well, clearly a phone.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.400]   That's got to be a 90% phone.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.520]   I think, Jeff--
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.000]   Of course, I stacked the deck in the way I worded the question.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.680]   Of course, that's what all the questions do.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.520]   You're being hoisted by your own potato,
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.480]   because you really want people to buy newspapers, don't you?
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.000]   That is your business.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.400]   I do, but I don't think that attitude is going to get us free.
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:00.280]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.000]   But thank you to the New York Times,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.200]   because they're the only place I saw this obituary
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.120]   for a rebel who founded Silicon Valley.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:12.120]   And a name I did not know.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.960]   He did not get the credit he deserves.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.480]   Jay last died at the age of 92.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:22.120]   He was one of the seven who left Shockley
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.280]   to form Fairchild's semiconductor.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.760]   And look at these guys in their white shirts.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.160]   Oh, cheers.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:29.960]   Black ties.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.400]   Gordon Moore.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:35.320]   Sheldon Roberts, Eugene Kleiner, later Kleiner Perkins.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:38.360]   Robert Neuss, Victor Grinich, Julius Blank.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.720]   Gene Herney and Jay last on the far right there.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.080]   He passed away this week at the age of 92.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:47.800]   Right, old age.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.840]   That's a good age to make it to 92.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:54.440]   One of the founders, the traitor is eight, they called them in 1960.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.280]   When they left Shockley,
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:01.880]   Shockley who invented the transistor and then later became a
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.640]   and won a Nobel Prize for it.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.280]   That noise invented the transistor.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:08.520]   He shared.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:09.160]   Hold on.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:11.960]   Shockley shared the Nobel Prize for the invention of the transistor.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.240]   So I don't know who the other person was.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.920]   And what did Kirby do?
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:20.440]   Jack Kirby.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.960]   Jack Kirby.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.320]   He was he did something with transistors.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.560]   Well, a quick perusal of the Wikipedia.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.600]   Hello, Wikipedia.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.240]   Say he's an American kind of a quick artist.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.560]   Oh, wait, maybe I'm thinking of saying, okay, hold on.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.160]   He'll be.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:37.640]   No.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.400]   Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:40.440]   That's a spy.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.240]   Yeah, he'll be.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.200]   Phil.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:42.840]   No, that's Philby.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:43.320]   Philby.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.160]   Let's see.
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.840]   All I know is these guys.
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:53.320]   Moore Roberts, Kleiner, Neuss, Grinich, Blank, Herney and Blast.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:55.720]   The.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:56.600]   Jack.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.000]   Jack.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.440]   Kilby.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.360]   Yes.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:05.160]   With Robert Neuss built the first integrated circuit.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.040]   Oh, I see.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:07.880]   He shared the Nobel Prize with.
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.240]   Okay.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:14.680]   They were at Texas Instruments in 1958 when they, along with Robert Neuss,
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.320]   created the integrated circuit.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:21.000]   Kilby, we talked about, because we were talking about last week,
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.360]   the 50th anniversary of the 4004.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:27.400]   He was the inventor of the handheld calculator.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.760]   Yeah, we talked about.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.160]   That's right.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.920]   Yeah, we talked about Kilby, actually.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.240]   So, yes, not Kirby.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:36.680]   This is hard.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.160]   Anyway.
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:37.800]   Close.
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:38.200]   Close.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.320]   We're at that stage.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.880]   You know, we're, a lot of these original creators
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.280]   are passing on.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:44.680]   Look at this.
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.560]   The Fairchild Semiconductor Lab in 1960.
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.920]   One computer historian said there was nothing more important
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:53.880]   than Fairchild Semiconductor to the Silicon Valley experience.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.840]   As we know it today, the traders ate, created the transistors.
[01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:58.600]   Who are those women in there?
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.760]   Yeah, they're the ones really doing the work, right?
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.800]   Only women are clean enough to be in our lab.
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.680]   The guys are out there smoking cigarettes,
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.600]   like waiting for the baby to be born.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:15.480]   I want a gift of that eye roll.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:22.280]   Anyway, yeah.
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:22.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.200]   With Dr. Lass' death, Gordon Moore is the last surviving member
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:33.080]   of the traitorous eight, of course, he was the creator of Moore's law,
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:41.320]   which we are still kind of, still kind of true,
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.960]   although rapidly wearing out.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.440]   Yeah, we're kind of, we're at the, I don't care what you can get.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:52.760]   Transistors on a processor will double every 18 months.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:56.600]   Now, I have to say the new Apple M1 chip is more than just a processor,
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.400]   but it has 57 billion transistors.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:00:59.960]   I don't know.
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.200]   Are we going to see 114 billion transistor processor in two?
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.480]   Does it matter?
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.440]   It's not this point.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.320]   No, no, no, no.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.400]   All right.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.240]   Oh, should we mention Gordon?
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:19.560]   I mean, Rupert taking a swing at Google and Facebook.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.920]   Yeah, just more of the same.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.760]   It's just another week, another swing.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.280]   Yep.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.560]   Are you watching succession?
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.040]   Oh, I am.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:29.400]   I finally started.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400]   It's still not as it's okay.
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.120]   I don't love it.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:32.440]   Okay.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.160]   When you get to the last week's episode, which is three years and six episodes in,
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:43.320]   two years and six episodes in, you will see the current episode is the payoff
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.640]   for the entire two and a half years.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.680]   It is the best episode of television I've ever seen.
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.640]   Wow, I've always started.
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:49.800]   All right.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:50.280]   I'm wow.
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.760]   Yeah, I've got 20 minutes left.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.800]   I was kind of like, I'm just so sick.
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.280]   I know people hate them because they're all awful.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:00.040]   And I know there are these periods where it's like,
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.720]   you're still worried about the shareholders meaning.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.840]   Come on, get off it.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.200]   But this most recent one where they're picking the next president,
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.360]   and that's what made me think of Rupert Murdoch is fascinating.
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:16.120]   And it's got some of the most, the funniest, most trenchant writing and television ever.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:17.480]   Jesse Armstrong is a genius.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.160]   It's fantastic.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.320]   In fact, I've watched it twice now and I've still missing bits of it.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.800]   Yeah, I tend to watch now the episode is twice.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:26.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.160]   Because it's the way it went.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:30.200]   And in the succession TV Reddit, they say,
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.400]   turn on the close captions because whoever's writing the close captions catches all the
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:40.440]   little Soto Vochi, Slice and Jabs that you don't even hear.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.960]   And so it's like a third script.
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:42.920]   You got to keep going.
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:43.880]   Watch it twice then.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.960]   Watch it a third time with his captions turned on.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.080]   It's really wild.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.600]   We watch everything with the captions.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:49.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.920]   Because I got a kid.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.600]   Because yeah.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.160]   So shiv it or husband, do you get that one?
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.640]   Tom Wamsgans.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:03.800]   Shiv's Midwestern long, tall drink of water.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.720]   Is rapidly becoming my pick for the Emmy award.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.960]   He is the actor who's British.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.560]   He and Greg.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:15.560]   Really?
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.440]   Because Greg.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:16.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:17.400]   So yeah.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:17.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:18.920]   And shiv is Australian.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:19.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.880]   If you, Tom Wamsgans is my absolute favorite, the actor is Matthew McFadden.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:32.120]   And he, I'm telling you, season three, episode six, just hold your horses till you get there.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.360]   And watch his expressions.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.640]   Watch his, listen to his lines.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.200]   There is some of the, I don't want to know spoilers, but some of the best writing on TV.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:42.920]   It's incredible.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.520]   And I just, I blows me away.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.800]   Aaron Sorkin times 10.
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.960]   Oh, well, that's not hard.
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.360]   I know.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.680]   Early Sorkin.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.480]   I mean, the West Wing was crazy.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.040]   Early Sorkin.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.240]   West Wing was crazy.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:53.800]   West Wing was crazy.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:54.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.600]   It's like early Sorkin even better.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.880]   Okay.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:58.520]   Even better.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:01.240]   You will love some of the lines in there.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:02.360]   You will just love it.
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.480]   And it, and it really does remind you of, of Murdoch.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:13.800]   The hero of succession is Logan Roy, who's a Scottish entrepreneur, who started a media
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:18.040]   empire, which includes a TV network called ATN that has certain resemblance to some network
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:19.480]   that is very popular right now.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.000]   And ATN is so important, so powerful.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.480]   Basically, he gets to pick the next president having destroyed the current president.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.760]   I just wish I could remember some of the lines.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:33.480]   They're so good.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.920]   Anyway, I don't want to spoil it.
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:35.400]   Enjoy.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:42.680]   Let us take a break and then come back because you too, I forgot to mention,
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.440]   Sam was here.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:49.480]   You may have said, well, where's where's, where's, where's, well, he's on vacation
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.760]   because it's Thanksgiving.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.880]   I think he said it last week.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.520]   We should have said that.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:52.760]   Good.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.800]   I should have mentioned it.
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:54.040]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:55.240]   He did say it last week.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.520]   He said he'd be sitting on the couch.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:59.240]   He's, I hope he's not watching.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:00.280]   Hi, and.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.480]   I hope he's enjoying some.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.360]   Oh, no.
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.840]   South Carolina hospitality.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:08.120]   Our show today brought to you by Andela.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.920]   Oh, when I talked to these guys, I just got it.
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:12.120]   I thought this is so great.
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.440]   They're a global talent network with a mission to connect brilliance to opportunity.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:21.800]   Brilliant is global, but opportunity isn't.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:26.520]   And you will find there are some tech talent out there.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:29.160]   So good, so good.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.080]   And Della gives them the opportunities.
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:34.760]   Look, your company these days is expected to move faster than ever before
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.600]   to stay ahead of the competition.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:41.160]   But how do you find the time to both build an onboard an amazing engineering team
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.680]   that'll get you where you need to go?
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:45.240]   This is where Andela can help.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:49.320]   They are the world's first talent network connecting innovative companies like yours
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.040]   with top tier vetted engineers.
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:55.800]   So you have more time to focus on your core business.
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:00.440]   They use expert technical recruiters, proprietary matching algorithms.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:03.720]   They connect you with developers who are the best in the business,
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:09.880]   enabling you to accelerate productivity, drive revenue, scale your business.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:16.280]   And I mean, the bottom line is brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity isn't.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:20.920]   And there are very talented people who are dying to work for you.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:23.560]   And Della finds them with a rigorous vetting process,
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.800]   which means it's easy for you.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:28.120]   They're hiring processes quick and efficient for you,
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:31.560]   but they maintain the highest quality admission standards.
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:35.400]   So you're getting top quality engineers, global talent too,
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:39.320]   at your fingertips, companies that limit themselves to hiring locally
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:41.640]   are at a severe disadvantage with Andela.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:45.240]   You could tap into their pool of highly qualified talent from around the world,
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.120]   cut your hiring timelines down for months to days.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.320]   And the ramp up times are very efficient.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:57.800]   Companies obviously have to do more with less these days, justify ROI consistently.
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:01.560]   When you hire Andela engineers, you can expect they'll be efficiently onboarded,
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:04.120]   ready to deliver value for your team within days.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:07.160]   And these engineers, by the way, are not just part time support.
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.640]   They're fully embedded into your organization.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:13.560]   And they arrange it so there's at least five hours of overlapping working hours.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.440]   So it's not like, oh, they're working at night.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.240]   You're working in the day.
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:19.480]   No, there'll be at least five hours of overlap.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:22.920]   I'll give you an example, a company called Mindshare, you might know,
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:26.760]   partnered with Andela to hire 10 new digital experts, including,
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:30.760]   I mean, top of the line data scientists, machine learning specialists, analysts,
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:36.040]   developers, the executive director and head of business intelligence at Mindshare says,
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.080]   quote, "As we continue to enhance the Synapse platform,
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:41.080]   time to value is very important.
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.680]   Andela is a good partner in helping us identify the right talent
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.200]   that is fit for different purposes.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.160]   It's time to tap into a wider talent pool.

[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:27.560]   Very important.

[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:39.800]   Andela is really doing something remarkable.

[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.960]   boom this is, both to your company and to the engineers
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:48.920]   and the talent from all over the world are giving a chance to.
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.920]   Andela.com/4-companies.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:58.200]   Time for Stacey's Pick of the Week.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:03.000]   Well, I just learned about Pi Kakin, but that's not actually my pick.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:03.720]   Pi Kakin?
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:05.320]   What's Pi Kakin?
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.920]   It's a cake in Pi.
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:07.960]   You can buy it.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:10.280]   It's a Pi baked in a cake.
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.720]   So really, it looks more like a Pi filling baked into the cake.
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:17.720]   Oh, but crust inside a cake would be a great thing.
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.680]   Oh, look at that.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:22.360]   That's a pumpkin pie inside a cake.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:29.000]   Yeah, so, I mean, given the holiday, you know what?
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.560]   I'm going to make that my pick and keep my device the next.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:32.440]   Keep that device.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.480]   Make some Pi Kakin.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.040]   And serve it.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.280]   Because, man, I don't have time to bake it for Thanksgiving,
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.360]   but now I got to try.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:44.920]   Kelly Ripa said, "Pi Kakin is pretty much the greatest thing that's happened to me
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:46.280]   besides the birth of my children."
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.080]   Look at this one from Goldbelly.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.240]   It's too late to get it for Thanksgiving, but what is that?
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.360]   Peacock pie pumpkin pie?
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:57.240]   You could get it, birdly.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:57.800]   Yeah.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:09:59.720]   And what's the top?
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:01.400]   It's the turduckin of cakes.
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:07.320]   The epic four-in-one layer dessert led to a pumpkin puree shortage in New York
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:12.840]   when it was invented in 2014, created by renowned pastry chef Zach Young, the Pi Kakin.
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:16.520]   It's a favorite of celebrities.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.720]   This is actually, I guess, Goldbelly is selling Zach Young's Pi Kakin.
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.400]   99 bucks for a cake.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:26.840]   Well, sure.
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.040]   But you're getting pie with it.
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:28.920]   But it's cake and pie.
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:30.040]   And it's coming in the bales.
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:30.920]   Yeah.
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:35.960]   I wish they'd tell me what kind of pies are in this Pi Kakin.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:36.920]   I see the pumpkin.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.840]   Looks like a spider cake.
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:39.960]   Is that a pecan at the bottom?
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.520]   Looks like pecan and it looks like there's apple pie on the top.
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:44.280]   Man, that looks good.
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.400]   Pie Kakin.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:45.800]   Yeah.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:49.240]   So yeah, so that's my cake now.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:50.120]   I'm like,
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.520]   Wow.
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:56.760]   Goldbelly has a whole pie cake and bake shop.
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:59.480]   There's also a Christmas pie cake.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.440]   That looks like red velvet.
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:03.000]   Yeah.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.320]   That looks like a hell of a lot of food coloring.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.120]   Oh boy.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.120]   How do you make red velvet?
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.080]   So you're welcome, y'all.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.600]   The red is not red dye number three unless you're taking a shortcut.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.200]   Oh, okay.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:18.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.120]   Red velvet cake is a cocoa powder.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:20.760]   What does it be?
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:21.720]   Yeah, cocoa powder.
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:24.280]   No, it's not really.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:29.320]   With the baking soda, the apple and the baking soda and the cocoa powder interact to create a red
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:30.040]   kind of a thing.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.960]   Oh, science.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:32.120]   Science.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:32.600]   Science.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:33.160]   Science.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:33.720]   Science.
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.960]   Oh, this, this, this one, they tell you what what's in the Christmas pie cake and
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.640]   pecan pie, eggnog cheesecake and red velvet cake
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:44.280]   layer together with amaretto buttercream and topped
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:46.600]   with a sweet and tart cherry pie filling.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:48.600]   Oh, that's a heart of taking a cake.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:49.960]   Heart of take, we call it.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:51.000]   Well, the shipping is free.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.240]   Yeah, for 99 bucks.
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:55.480]   Can I order some marijuana?
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:55.960]   I love it.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.400]   They offer four interest free payments of 24.75.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.160]   Take it off to cake for Christmas.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:09.400]   Take out a loan for that pie cake and Mr. Jarvis, how about a number?
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.120]   Oh, I got crappy ones this week, but sometimes we'll go with the Thanksgiving thing with the
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:22.120]   the the now traditional Google search Thanksgiving casserole, which tells me I have to leave my state
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:23.240]   because I hate broccoli.
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:29.320]   Okay, I'm trying to unpack this.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:33.640]   This is basically side dishes by state.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:34.200]   Is that right?
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:34.760]   Yes.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:35.160]   Okay.
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.040]   The search resist.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:36.360]   Yes.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:40.600]   My other favorite here, so, so New Jersey is broccoli, along with New York
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.600]   and Massachusetts.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.800]   The amazing one is the side dish casserole in Pennsylvania is leftovers,
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.320]   which kind of seems like a time machine.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.320]   Leftovers.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:51.880]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.560]   It's a nice covered dish.
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:58.440]   California, they say Mexican corn that now this is not just made up like,
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.760]   oh, you're California, you must like Mexican corn.
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:02.360]   This is actual Google searches.
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:03.480]   Yes.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:05.400]   Well, it's it's differentiated.
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:09.240]   Like most people in California probably search for like stuffing, but.
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:10.840]   No, this is casserole.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:11.400]   There's enough.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:12.040]   So they call it.
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:12.680]   Oh, sorry.
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:14.680]   Uniquely searched Thanksgiving casserole.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:17.400]   So I guess you'd have to say Thanksgiving casserole.
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:19.640]   Well, no, no, what happened?
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.120]   No, what happens is they look at like most people in California probably surf stuffing,
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.040]   but the most weird search thing that people search from California is
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:28.840]   Mexican corn.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.440]   But is stuffing a casserole?
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.200]   I can't believe that because everyone's stuff.
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:34.840]   Sorry.
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.600]   Sweet potato casserole.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.640]   Okay.
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:38.200]   Whichever.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:40.120]   Oh, so mac and cheese here.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:41.320]   You know what I had today?
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:41.560]   What?
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.840]   I went to Popeyes because I had to try the Popeyes.
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.760]   Oh, they're advertising the mac and cheese.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:47.160]   Is it good?
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.640]   Is it cheesy?
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:50.920]   Cheese, delicious?
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:52.440]   These are delicious.
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:52.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.080]   Wow.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.600]   I had at the fanciest restaurant in Petaluma.
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:00.920]   The other night, we love this central market.
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.120]   I had kachoy pepe.
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:08.200]   With a Bucatini pasta.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.880]   It was fantastic.
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:11.960]   They do a good microwave there?
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:14.360]   Straight from TJ's.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.680]   No, I have a feeling they made it from scratch.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:19.960]   I'm just saying.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:22.600]   I don't, you know what?
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:24.040]   If I had, I might have that tonight.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:24.920]   I think I'm talking about maybe.
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.280]   Oh, it's kachoy pepe night.
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:29.800]   On top of Popeyes though, that could be very bad for me.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:30.280]   Wow.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:31.240]   I don't know.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.960]   So is that the chief attribute of Popeyes mac and cheese is cheese?
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:40.120]   Well, they also, it's, you know, it comes in the,
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:43.160]   in your basic fast food cardboard thing.
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:46.040]   But somehow they get a baked crust on it too.
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:46.920]   Oh.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:49.320]   Probably they bake it.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.120]   Yeah, I was going to say there's a broiler.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.240]   Some, I mean, broilers, you can just take it under there for 30 seconds.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.280]   Broil it, broil it.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:56.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.000]   You know, I should have come.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.480]   I came, I came empty handed to this.
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.480]   You've been doing that for months.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.080]   You have, you have not played along with this.
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.240]   Well, you've, I'll be frank.
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:07.720]   Stop.
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.040]   Usually I have a pick and then I wait and see how long the show has gone.
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:15.960]   And I stop myself.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:20.600]   I mean, I have picks, but nothing I'm really crazy about.
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:24.120]   I, I've forgotten a lot of them, but almost every week,
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:26.120]   Jason will back me up almost every week.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:26.840]   I have a pick.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:28.360]   I put it in her.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.680]   Or as I'm like sticking mine in at the last minute.
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.280]   Yeah, I just, I want to take a back seat to the brilliant people
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.000]   who are on this show with me.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:37.480]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:38.760]   Nice try.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.560]   No, no, I do.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:40.040]   I do.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:40.520]   I do.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.600]   Thank you very much.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:45.480]   That is what I am thankful for is the great people I get to work with
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:50.680]   each and every week on shows like this, not necessarily this, but like this.
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:53.080]   No.
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.240]   I'm grateful for both of you and the whole, very grateful.
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:00.680]   Knowing you, Jeff, all these years has been a great pleasure.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:06.680]   I just, I think the world of you and Stacy, I know it feels like, I mean,
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.760]   you've been here years, but it feels like you're the new kid.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:10.920]   You're just fantastic.
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:12.280]   You had so much to the show.
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:13.880]   What a blessing to have gotten you to join.
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:14.440]   No kids.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:16.360]   No, you had big shoes to fill.
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:18.920]   Gina Trapani was a, was a legend.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:19.720]   Pretty awesome.
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:20.040]   Yep.
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.120]   But you have absolutely done it.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.320]   And we thank you so much.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:25.320]   You're not allowed to have big feet.
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:25.640]   Do you?
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:27.960]   I don't think so.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:28.920]   I don't think so.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:29.880]   We're a size 10.
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:31.560]   Really?
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.000]   Yeah.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:33.000]   Really?
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.120]   I wouldn't have guessed that.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.760]   My husband and I have the same size shoe.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:37.640]   Wow.
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:39.560]   Where do you get your slippers?
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:47.800]   That note, Stacy, you can buy them as it's Stacy.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.320]   Do they make them that big there?
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:50.920]   It all means Stacy.
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:53.480]   You buy the men's wicked good slippers.
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.120]   I bet you do.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:57.560]   Stacy@iot.com.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:59.720]   You should listen to her podcast with Kevin Tofol,
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.400]   subscribe to her newsletter.
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:03.080]   And of course, check out the events.
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:04.680]   There's always something interesting going on.
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:07.240]   It's Stacy@iot.com.
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.360]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:16.840]   Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.800]   Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig.
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:22.760]   Sorry, there were a cigarette break and we had to get them back on.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:31.720]   Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.520]   I think for Christmas, I am going to buy you the official Corral version of it.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.840]   But for Craig.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:40.120]   For Variety, yeah.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.480]   And share with Craig because he did inspire the whole thing.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:46.440]   Absolutely.
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:47.000]   Yes, he did.
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:50.600]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday.
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:54.440]   It's 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:58.440]   I say that because you can watch us make it live at live.twit.tv.
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:04.520]   If you're watching live chat live at irc.twit.tv or in our ClubTwit Discord,
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:05.960]   which is always great fun.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:13.560]   They're fabulous with the animated gifts and all sorts of other things.
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:19.720]   If you want to join ClubTwit at $7 a month, you get ad-free versions of all of our shows,
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:24.840]   access to the Discord, Stacey's book group I hear went really well.
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:26.520]   Actually, are you having a book?
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.800]   We threw it out the room, man.
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:29.720]   Yeah, we had overflow.
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:32.760]   We figured out how to get more people in next time.
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:38.280]   And you're still trying to decide what book you're not going to do murder bots to for the next one.
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:41.240]   No, we want to open you up to more worlds.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:43.160]   So there's a poll.
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:44.840]   Yeah, I think we've got a week.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:46.040]   It's a week-long poll.
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:54.280]   It's between Autonomous, Ken Liu's latest book of short stories, Autonomous is by
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:19:00.600]   Analie Newitz, and then Ancillary Justice by Ann Lickie.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:05.880]   And then whatever the, I don't think anyone's voted for it.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.720]   So whatever the Ken Liu book is.
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.040]   So if you're in the club, go to the ClubTwit events channel in the Discord,
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:13.560]   and there's a link there.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:16.520]   The Stacey Higginbotham Book Club vote on the next book.
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.240]   It's a little complicated.
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.920]   The way you vote is by clicking.
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:21.880]   I don't know.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:22.360]   What do you do?
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:23.160]   You click a link.
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:25.640]   You're going down to the bottom.
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:26.600]   Yeah, I've been trying to get there.
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:26.680]   To get there.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:30.600]   To get all the way to the very, very bottom of the conversation.
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.400]   Oh my God, it's very long.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:38.120]   Well, it just shows you there was a severe demand for this.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.160]   Holy.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:39.960]   Yeah, y'all.
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.160]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:45.640]   I'm trying to find that, can you just search Autonomous and then maybe we'll get there.
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.120]   Let's see.
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:47.720]   Click on the numbers at the bottom.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:51.880]   There it is.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:53.400]   Oh.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.560]   I'm completely, you know what?
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.160]   We got to come up with a better way to do this.
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.240]   Keep going up.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:01.560]   Yeah.
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:03.320]   To the top.
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.080]   The middle.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:07.160]   All right.
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:07.640]   Forget it.
[02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:08.600]   This is not going to.
[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:09.560]   If you go, okay.
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:10.040]   There it is.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.560]   Search Autonomous.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:11.960]   There it is.
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:12.440]   I got it.
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:18.200]   It was a dino bot poll, but it's stuck in the middle of the thing.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.120]   I don't even know how you find it.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:24.440]   So right now we've got 16 votes for Autonomous by Analee Doets.
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:27.720]   We interviewed her by the way about the book on triangulation.
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:29.320]   So she's great.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:29.560]   Yup.
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:36.520]   Ancillary Justice has seven votes and The Hidden Girl and Other Stories by Ken Liu has
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:37.160]   five votes.
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:40.520]   But now we know that this poll is here.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:41.880]   We have no way to find it.
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:46.760]   I encourage you if you can find it, vote.
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:47.800]   Okay.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:50.360]   I think if you start here, try searching for Lucky.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.160]   L-E-K-
[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:53.560]   L-E-C-K-I-E.
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:54.760]   L-E-C-K-I-E.
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:55.560]   That's the match.
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:57.560]   Oh, now I'm all clear what to search for.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:59.160]   Can you say it again?
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:20:59.560]   Well, okay.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:00.840]   L-E-C-K-I-E.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:03.400]   That works.
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:04.440]   That works.
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.840]   So there it is on the right under L-E-C-K-I-E.
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:07.800]   Or Analynnewitz.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:11.400]   You probably could find it with Newitz or Ken Liu, The Hidden Girl.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:13.320]   I just like that name.
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:14.360]   I want to try that.
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:16.280]   Anyway, there's three choices.
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:20.600]   The next, oh, you can't vote on this.
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:23.880]   You just, yeah, you can vote.
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:30.040]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:31.800]   I haven't found the right thing.
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:33.960]   Yeah.
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:36.040]   So you click, then you click the search result.
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:37.320]   It'll take you that part.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:38.840]   And then you click the icon.
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.280]   The bottom, Jesus Christ.
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:42.520]   You could just get more confusing.
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:45.800]   Wait until you try to unsubscribe to Club2it.
[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.400]   Then you're going to have some fun.
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:52.440]   It doesn't require a phone call, but you have to juggle.
[02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:54.840]   No, we actually make it easy.
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:57.880]   If you want to know more, go to twint.tv/club2it.
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:01.960]   I think this was possibly the worst ad we've ever done for Club2it.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:04.520]   It makes me want to quit, to be honest with you.
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:06.120]   You get ad free versus all the shows,
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:07.400]   access to this, the Twisk Plus.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:10.760]   It's too much fun watching Leo screw up, which includes that loan.
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:11.800]   That reason to be there.
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.080]   Worth the price of vision.
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.400]   And you do get things like the Stacey Book Club,
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.560]   which is actually on the Twit Plus feed.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:19.240]   We're going to do Steve Gibson soon.
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:20.920]   Barry Jofoli is next week.
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:21.800]   Ask me anything.
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:23.800]   So there's lots of great events inside the club.
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:25.800]   I think it's well worth your seven bucks,
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:26.760]   but I'm a little biased.
[02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:30.360]   If you don't want to pay, it's fine too.
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.360]   We have ad supported versions of everything we do.
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:33.880]   You can get those at our website,
[02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:38.280]   twit.tv/twig, or you can even subscribe
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:39.800]   in your favorite podcast client,
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:41.480]   and you can get it automatically.
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:46.280]   And if you will, if you like the show,
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:47.960]   please leave us a nice five star review.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:50.200]   If you don't like the show, just please forget about it.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:51.080]   But if you like the show,
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.680]   five star review would be very helpful.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.080]   We want to spread the word about the goodness
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.560]   that is this week in Google.
[02:22:57.560 --> 02:23:00.200]   Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.360]   What are you doing for Thanksgiving, Jeff, anything?
[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:06.760]   My father is here, so Jake is coming down.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:08.120]   Oh, it's good.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:09.880]   The family's got to get them all.
[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:11.160]   Yeah, we're going to have about 10 people.
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:13.720]   Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:18.120]   We're doing a ham and steak and stuff like that.
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:19.320]   Grilling or?
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:21.480]   I'm going to sludge the ham on my grill this day.
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:23.320]   Suvete and then grill the steak,
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:25.720]   making popovers, which I just love.
[02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:27.240]   Oh, I know.
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:33.160]   I got 12, two, 12 cup popover trays.
[02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:35.560]   So I'll make-- Oh, I was wondering if you had the popover paste.
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:36.680]   Oh, you have to.
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:37.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:37.880]   Yeah.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:39.560]   Yeah, it's part of the fun.
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.000]   Stacy, I don't think you said,
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.200]   where I asked you the early part of the show,
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.040]   what are you making?
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:47.320]   Oh, I'm making chicken, green beans.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:48.920]   Right, that you said, green beans, okay.
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:51.080]   Gluten-free green beans,
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.680]   which is one of the things people search for,
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:54.680]   or gluten-y green beans.
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:56.840]   How could you get gluten in a green bean?
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.160]   I don't know, but that's a specific search.
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:01.240]   You could coat them in flour and fry them.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:02.040]   That's not a good idea.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:02.760]   That's not a good idea.
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:03.320]   Oh, no.
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:03.720]   All right.
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:04.760]   They're quite--
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.160]   They're quite--
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:06.120]   Dipplement ranch.
[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:06.680]   I make mine with--
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:07.880]   Oh, that does sound good, actually.
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:10.200]   I make mine with slivered almonds,
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:12.920]   and then I sprinkle little crispy onions on the top.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.840]   I do them in ginger and garlic.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:16.200]   Oh, that sounds good.
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:18.360]   Yeah, sprinkle sesame seeds on the top.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:20.360]   My heritage, my hillbilly heritage,
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.200]   is to cook green beans.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:23.640]   Believe it or not, cook green beans.
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:24.280]   We don't do this.
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:25.000]   Could I burn?
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:25.800]   Kill me.
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.640]   Uh, well, no ham hocks.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:28.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.200]   That sounds fantastic.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.440]   If I had any ham hocks--
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:33.320]   I can fall apart.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:38.040]   But none of this crisp stuff.
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:38.200]   No.
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:39.080]   So--
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:39.400]   Oh, no.
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:43.560]   They're so good when they're all crispy and like flash fried.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.240]   Oh, I've got to blanch the green beans.
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:45.720]   Oh, God.
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:46.200]   Quick.
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:47.320]   Get going.
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.040]   Green bean--
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.000]   I got blanched too.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.120]   I'm doing that tonight too.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:51.560]   I'm making the pop over dough,
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:53.640]   and I'm making a German chocolate cake,
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.920]   because I want to have time tomorrow.
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.160]   So got some work to do.
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:59.880]   Oh, I am so jealous.
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:02.440]   Oh, I make a hell of a German chocolate cake.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:03.720]   Oh, Leo, I'm coming.
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:05.880]   Okay, I don't care if you invite me to your house,
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.320]   but I'm in California.
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:07.880]   I'm coming.
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:08.440]   I'm coming.
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.200]   I only problem is because that icing--
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.840]   That is sweet, but I'm making a double boiler
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:13.960]   with condensed milk, and--
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:16.440]   And if I want to make it less sweet,
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:18.680]   I put it pecans and shredded coconut--
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:21.080]   The recipe calls for sweetened.
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:23.720]   I use the best foods recipe for the icing,
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:26.280]   but I use a listener's recipe for the chocolate cake,
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.040]   which has a little bit of coffee in it
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:29.480]   to give it a nice little cake.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:30.600]   It's very delicious.
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:33.400]   Oh, are you making the world's best potatoes tomorrow?
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:33.640]   Yes.
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:35.000]   Of course--
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:35.880]   In my thermomics?
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:36.840]   You can't have them.
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:37.480]   Yes.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.720]   I'm making the New York Times mashed potatoes,
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:42.120]   because I have never mastered mashed potatoes.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:42.840]   I've never done that.
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:43.640]   The nice, mashed thermomics.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:47.640]   I don't know how it does it, but it really whips them,
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:49.560]   because it's kind of like a blender in there.
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.160]   And so there's never any lumps.
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.120]   It's very creamy.
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:54.440]   The only problem is it's also sticky.
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.760]   There are very--
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:57.240]   There's a lot--
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.120]   You need a lot of butter to make it go down.
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:04.520]   Got it.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:05.160]   It's good.
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.200]   It's really good.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:08.280]   When you come over, we'll do thermomics mania.
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:09.480]   We'll do it all.
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:10.840]   He'll be fun.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:11.320]   I love it.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:11.720]   Yeah.
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:13.160]   We'll shoot the show from your kitchen
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:15.080]   with Stacy playing with the thermomics.
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.800]   I'll get my son to come over to chop things really fast.
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:18.440]   Whoa.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:19.080]   It'll be great.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:19.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.080]   It'll be great.
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:23.960]   Actually, you are all going to get
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.520]   a holiday gift from my son this year.
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:29.080]   So stay tuned.
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.040]   Oh, my.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:30.760]   Yes.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:32.280]   He's got a new product line.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:33.640]   Is it salty?
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:34.680]   It's a little salty.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:35.560]   Yes.
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.440]   Salt.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.240]   Hank.
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:38.120]   Salt.
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.400]   He already has it.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.000]   How quickly did he do that?
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:46.200]   The speed with which this is all happening is kind of--
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:46.520]   Good Lord.
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:47.480]   Mind boggling.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.080]   Now shouldn't Sam Lesson invest in him?
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:54.040]   Yeah, did you pitch salt?
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.160]   Hank, did Sam Lesson invest?
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:56.840]   I'm staying out of it.
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:59.160]   He's already signed a deal with DBA.
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:01.000]   They're managing his sales.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.880]   He's got this salt deal.
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:07.720]   You got to see his logo.
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:08.680]   It's the cutest thing.
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:10.440]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:12.040]   I don't know if I--
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:13.480]   It's on my phone, so I don't know if I can
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.840]   blow it up enough for you to see it.
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.000]   But I told him he's the next chef boy or a D.
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:21.720]   There's salt.
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:22.760]   There's salt.
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:24.520]   Hank's logo for the salt.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:25.640]   Oh, nice.
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:26.840]   Yeah, essential flaky.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:27.160]   Oh, wow.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:28.200]   That sounds so great.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:30.680]   There's the Calabrian pesto.
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:32.200]   There's the--
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:32.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:35.080]   There's a truffle salt in here.
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:36.280]   There it is.
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.840]   It's going to be good.
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:40.520]   It's going to be good.
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:41.560]   It's truffle and garlic.
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.320]   And all of it featuring--
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:45.640]   Salt Hank.
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:46.280]   Salt Hank.
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:48.600]   I just--
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:50.360]   Where did the moniker come from?
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.480]   Why is he there?
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:53.240]   Well, he used to be sodium deficiency,
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:55.480]   which wasn't the gaggiest name ever.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.400]   That's like a fan name.
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:27:59.880]   I know.
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:02.840]   This is what I love about it.
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:07.160]   It's all been unconscious and just doing what he really loves.
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:09.800]   And it somehow kind of magically manifested.
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:11.400]   Twit was like that too in the early days.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.240]   It just kind of all came together.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:15.880]   Sometimes if you do something,
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:18.040]   you're really passionate about it and it's going--
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:20.120]   and it's just like you're doing what you love it.
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:21.640]   The universe gets together.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:22.520]   It's a beautiful thing.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:23.400]   And it's a beautiful thing.
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:23.800]   Yeah.
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:25.320]   Caught up for Thanksgiving.
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:30.440]   So you want to end the show, Leo?
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:31.960]   Oh, I probably should wind this show up.
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.920]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:36.280]   John wants to go home.
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:37.640]   Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:39.000]   We'll see you next week.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.280]   Actually, I'll see you on Saturday.
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:42.520]   We'll see you all next week on this week in Google.
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.080]   Bye-bye.
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.640]   Hey, you don't have to wait until the weekend
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:47.400]   to get the tech news you need.
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:49.400]   Join Jason Howell and myself,
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:51.480]   Mike Asargent for Tech News Weekly,
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:54.120]   where we talk to and about the people making
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:55.800]   and breaking the tech news.
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:06.200]   [MUSIC]
