[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey. Jeff and Aunt, they're all here.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.680]   We'll find out why Stacey and Jeff both hate their Pixel 6. We'll see some pretty nice pictures. Aunt took with his Pixel 6.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:21.000]   I'll defend the Pixel 6. Then we'll take a visit to the Icelandverse, see what Mark Zuckerberg thinks of that, and some new stuff for Twitter.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   It's actually pretty good news. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show where we cover the Google first, my buddy Aunt Prud, sitting right next to me from hands-on photography.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's no nice to have somebody in the studio, anybody, just to keep me company.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And I'm so glad to be here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yeah, thrilled to have you.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   John and Berk are like, "What are we, chopped liver?"
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   No, that's fine, but they've been with me since.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oh, take anybody's.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   They've been with me for two years. I'm sick to death of them.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'll take them.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Wow.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Wow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   No, I don't.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   There's other people around too, but sitting next to me at the table is really nice.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Also, Stacey, and I wish Stacey you were sitting next to me at the table, but you're far away in Seattle. It's good to have you. Stacey Higginbotham. Stacey@iot.com.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's always my preference to have people in the studio, if possible.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No doubt.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Just not always possible, unfortunately.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah, I don't know. The way you've got that table set up so low, I think it's too high now.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Do you have big thighs like Aunt?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm going to try to crush his thighs.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   No.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   See, it's all the way down.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I've learned how to sit over here next to you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I have apparently very narrow thighs.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I'm not saying a little bit, so my quads aren't contracted.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   This is the Relaxer Quads show. That's Jeff Jarvis right there.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Wait a minute, you have the jingle ready?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   He is the Leonard Town Professor for journalistic innovation at The...
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:41.160]   Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig School of Journalism, School of Journalism, School of Journalism at the City University of New York. That's literally what they mean when they say you don't have to make a big production out of it. That's literally what they're talking about.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.000]   We made a big production out of it. I'm surprised this is not, this shouldn't be our lead story but I'm a
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.160]   make it our lead story. They are renaming the Staples Center which is the big, beautiful, you know what it is right now, that's where who plays there?
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.280]   That's where the Lakers, what was it called before was the Staples Center? It's always been the
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   State, since they built it, before that they had to go to the forum. Was it the paper clip center before that?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   That would be nice. Okay, so they've rebranded it. Staples has given up their branding to
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   crypto.com arena. That's crazy. Now we know we are living in the future. You know, but got the money up front.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.440]   But at the same time crypto.com is all over F1 and you know how much money is going in F1.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.000]   Formula One Racing. Yes. Crypto. I don't even know what crypto.com is. It's just a service
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that allows you to acquire crypto way easier than you know trying to figure out how to create a crypto wallet yourself.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.720]   It's about like Coinbase. Okay. I did see a story about how they've arrested, actually I think it was on
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   security now yesterday. The Ukrainian crypto giant who was because his crypto exchange was being used for ransomware.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   Yes. Yes. So it was another one of the ransomware arrests. The US is really pissed. That's it. We're taking you guys down.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   So you know, it's too bad because I think there's nothing inherently evil or wrong about Bitcoin.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Just as there wasn't frankly anything inherently creepy or wrong about BitTorrent. Right.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   But because BitTorrent was often used for piracy, it became the piracy. And I worry that because of
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   ransomware and other misuses of crypto that the crypto is going to be seen that way. But doesn't it happen with all the things we use?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   I mean, the internet was supposed to be why we can't have nice things right in for communication and information.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   And yet at the same time. The internet is a good thing for now. But yet at the same time. Yes, there's foreign to this pool.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   You are becoming you are becoming Jeff Jarvis already. And we haven't even gotten to the ramp portion of the program yet.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   You see, look at that was a positive rant that was that was defending the internet. The internet is of it. That's not a rant.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   US detained crypto exchange exec for helping Ryu Kranz and where gang Londor profits. Dennis Dennis Dubnikov,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   founder of egg change and crypto coyote. He was he was actually on vacation. He was attempting to vacation in Mexico tonight entry to the country.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   They sent him to Amsterdam where he was arrested by Dutch police to request the FBI.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   Actually, he's not yet from Ukraine. He's a Russian national.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   So one more arrest. I wonder he was helping Ryu. Aren't they a Russian gang?
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   Yeah, it seems like all the ransomware games are in Russia. I don't know why that is. They just given Russia a bad name, right?
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   All right. Now back to the real news. The top of the top of the top of the heap. A number one, Stacy hates her Pixel 6.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   Yeah, this is the top of the the garbage heap. Y'all.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   Oh, no. Wait a minute. I love my Pixel 6 Pro. Took it to Mexico. Got great pictures.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   I was just talking about how I've decided not to use the Pixel launcher, but switched over to a third-party launcher.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   Did he enjoy that freedom? And that's one of the things I love about Android. I don't have to use their launcher.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   And I'm using action launcher, but there's many good ones, including Scooter X, like Snowvol launcher, use that for years.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   There's one called lawn chair, which has a good name.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   Microsoft even has its own launcher, but I like, but I'm using action X and it gives me a lot more control over how it looks and feels and stuff.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   But what is it you don't like about? So I'm just saying I'm just going to stand up for the Pixel 6 Pro. Now you got the Pixel 6.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   I got the Pixel 6 and my issue with it. There are two issues. One, it's freaking heavy. Like it is literally hurting my wrist.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   What did you have before? I had the 3A. It was like 150 grams versus 207 grams.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   So this is a huge... So so it's the whole pound more. Same with the 4A. It was ridiculously light.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   No, I'm sorry. I put this on my scale. It's half a pound. It's almost half a pound.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   Total. Total. Total. So a few ounces more, I guess is what I was thinking. 28 grams. So yeah. 4 ounces more.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   It's like 2 ounces more. I think. 2 ounces more. It doesn't seem that heavy, but okay.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   Okay. It is truly heavy. And like when I'm holding it one hand, it's kind of hard to control and keep it all in.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   So that's one. Do you have a firmly floppy wrist?
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   Okay, let's... You're going to feel really bad about this, but I had carpal tunnel.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Oh, you do have flarky. Okay.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   So my grip strength is not great, but there are lots of people who have arthritis or extra floppy wrists.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   I mean, it is inconvenient to like...
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   So this is a personal thing. It's not necessarily a indictment of the phone.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   Yeah. So, well, okay. The second reason I'm doing it is because this fingerprint sensor is just...
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   Okay. That is more of an indictment of the phone. And a lot of people are complaining about it.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   Yep. Google says that they are pushing...
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   I think being too heavy and not... Hold on.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   I think being so heavy, like half a pound is a lot. Like...
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   And I think that's an indictment thinking about the user base because I think there are probably lots of women, people with small hands,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   people who suffer from any sort of joint disease. This is a problem and that there's no alternative.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   That's what gets me. It's not that...
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   Well, there are lots of alternatives. It's just not in the...
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   Just not the flagship pixel variety.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   Right. But I think that's a big... I mean, I think...
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   You think Google should make phones in a variety of sizes? I mean, I guess they do.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   Big and small. Yeah. I think it's not crazy to be like, here's a medium-sized phone and here's our supercharged pro phone.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   Is it safe to say a 6A would be ideal for you if they continue along that same trajectory...
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   It's not going to be much lighter. I don't think.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   If they give rid of the glass, I mean, the glass is what's heavy and a lot of people.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   And I love you for thinking this. Y'all are totally right. It does feel super premium.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   But I would love to get rid of that premiumness because... I mean, okay.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   When you're lying on your back, trying to read your phone, God help you if it slips.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   It's going to whack you and it's going to hurt so hard.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   You would hate the Pixel 6 Pro. It's even heavier.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   I know. I've been sitting here googling the weight and grams of all these phones this last week.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   So I guess the argument I would say for this is...
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   I'm glad Google made a phone and didn't say, "Oh, well, we got to really limit what this phone can do because we want to keep it under a certain weight."
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   They still make the 4A in the 5... You can still get the 5, the 4A, the 5A, right?
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   So, and I'm sure those are lighter. You can't get the 5 anymore.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   You can only get the 5A. The 5 was actually what I wanted to get, but they don't sell it anymore.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   So I'm thinking about... I bet you can get it on Amazon or somewhere. Google made us...
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   Yeah, I think I can get it. Yeah.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   So that's a personal choice. And of course, you're certainly entitled to your personal choice.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   The fingerprint reader is something that a lot of people are complaining about.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   Again, I haven't had any problem with the fingerprint reader, but is it laggy for you?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   It's both laggy and honestly, again, with it being so heavy, I'm having it in the back.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   This is where I'm supporting my phone anyway.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   And when I have to move my thumb over, it's farther... It's a little... It's not too far, but it's almost too far,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   and it kind of destabilizes it with the weight.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   So you can't get a good sperm press on it.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   Yeah, I don't get a good press, and you need that press.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   See, I've moved over to the two-handed phone operation, basically.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   I gave up a long time ago on one-handed phone operation.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   You're like Trump with a glass of water.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   It's not just... I mean...
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   Don't fight more. It's there.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   I have... I mean, if I'm walking with a dog, I've got a leash in one hand.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   I've got groceries. I've got a kid. I've got all... I mean, like, the times when I'm...
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   Oh, don't the dog in this head?
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   Yes, I could totally use my phone.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   What's the priority, Stacey? The phone. More important than anything else.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   And I would say, any time I'm out in public, I try really hard not to be super focused on my phone,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   because then that makes me a target.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   So I also like to just be quickly access things, and I can't on this thing.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   That's why you need the Pixel Buds, right?
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   You know what you need, Stacey?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   Pixel Buds.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   An iPhone Mini?
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   Well, they... You know, this... I run it because Apple stopped making the Mini's because they didn't sell very well.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Well, they started making... They started making this won't want to get my wife finally got a new phone.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Yeah, they make the 13 Mini.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   Oh, they do make the 13 Mini?
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   They do, yeah.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   Okay.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   I apologize, I was wrong.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   Is the flip... The flip opened...
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   Oh, the Samsung?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   Samsung.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   I was actually... I'm going to go to the Verizon store and see what kind of...
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   I love the Samsung options are this.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   I think the flip 3 is great.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   That's why I have the one to play.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   And the flip 3 has a fingerprint reader on the side.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   On the side, right?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   So, and it works very well and very quickly.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   Oh, man.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   And you can hold it with one hand.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   Maybe the... Maybe the Mini... The flip 3 rather is for you.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   I enjoy this phone.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   That sounds... I mean...
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   It's fine.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   It's fine.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   Dainty.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   But I have large chains.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   I really just...
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   You do.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   I wanted to stay with Andrew or Andrew.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   I do want to stay with Andrew.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   He's my husband.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   Okay, that's over.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   I wanted to stay with...
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   We'll be glad to hear that.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   You're a safe Andrew.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   The iPhone Mini is 141 grams.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   How much did you say the Pixel 6 is?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   207.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   207.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   So it's 60 grams.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   That's pretty substantial.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   Yeah, that's like 2.5 ounces.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   So...
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   Okay.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   Okay.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   It hurts my feelings.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   I don't know why.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   I don't care.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   You should go whatever you want.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   I just... I really...
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   I guess what I'm thinking is I'm so happy that Google finally made a big jump in their phone.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   I didn't buy the 5 because it was no much...
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   Right.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   No better than the 4 XL.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   So... And I always buy the XL so I don't... Large doesn't buy.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   I'm a big guy.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   You are?
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   But I want...
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   Yeah, would you say...
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   Dan, would you call a big guy?
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   You are?
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   I'm rotund not beefy like you.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   Okay.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   You're short.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   5.10 is not short.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   Oh yeah it is.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   Oh yeah it is.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   Did Burke is not short?
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   [Laughs]
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   Did I?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   You're not a big guy.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   Wrong.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   I'm just really happy to be here.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   You said my opinion just isn't...
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   What did you say about my opinion?
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   It was my personal opinion.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   It's not...
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   It's not really a pro.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   I'm just saying it's not a criticism as the phone.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   It's just too heavy for you.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   I don't think that that's a criticism of the phone.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   The fingerprint reader is a criticism of the phone.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   My problem is still Android 12.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   I continue to have issues with Bluetooth connectivity.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   It just...
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Todles off.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   Just for whatever reason just shuts off.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   Not necessarily the devices disconnect but the actual switch.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   I really want to defend this phone.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   The phone is fine.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   I shouldn't care.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   I don't have a dog in there.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   I have had no problems with it.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   I think it's a really good phone and I'm really pleased that Google finally stepped up to the plate.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   Great camera.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   It's fast.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   Are you having reception?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   I've noticed my reception on this phone is in areas where it had been dodging.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   I feel like we're on Reddit now.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   It's dodging.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   No.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   I live on an island with dodgy reception so I can't really complain.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   But compared...
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   I'm not able to...
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   It's getting full call.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   She ran so nice.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   It's a basis that I had been.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   I mean there are a lot of people who are unhappy with the Pixel 6.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   It's funny because we were talking on Windows Weekly this morning.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   And Mary Jo Foley is not happy with it.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   Paul isn't happy with it.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   What are their reasons?
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   I think the fingerprint reader primarily...
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   Mary Jo said it was too heavy.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   Yeah, she's too heavy for her.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   She does like the camera.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   She's really happy with the camera.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   Well, you're going to have a...
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   This is lighter than a camera.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   It is.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   You're going to have a...
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   There's a certain amount.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   There's a con commit between capabilities.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   It's lighter than carrying around a super computer, which it is.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   But you know...
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   No, but I mean...
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   I mean if you were to carry a good camera...
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   This is very, very good camera and it's a lot lighter than any other camera that you might have.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   You are trying so hard to visualize it.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   They work in...
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   You really are.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   If I can't maneuver the camera or maneuver the phone safely, I can't use any of it.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   No, I'm not saying you shouldn't throw it away.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   I'm just...
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   I don't want people...
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   I was just going to return it.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   I want to do whatever you want.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   I just kind of want...
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   Oh, mine was...
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   I almost had it off the window all the way.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.720]   I don't want people to hate it because I really think pixels...
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.720]   I'm not saying...
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   Google did a good job.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   By the way, they're selling hotcakes.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   Of course...
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   Yeah, and you know what?
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   It's...
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   I love many parts of this phone.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   You know, and I was looking for this phone, but it's just too heavy for me.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   But I think that's a valid criticism, especially for people who...
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Sure.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Absolutely.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   I mean, lots of people want smaller phones too.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   How about...
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   So what don't you like about it, Jeff?
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   So, I've had a big week.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Oh, no.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   At a place...
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   My laptop, every cable box in the house, which is more than you want to know about Verizon
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   and a phone.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   And so it wasn't a good week.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.720]   Did they take away your cord?
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   It was difficult.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   It was difficult.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   What cord?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   Jeff has a corded phone, a landline phone with a cord.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   Oh, no.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   Oh, no.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   He still has it.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   What?
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   (laughter)
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   So I thought maybe they took that away.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   He was like, "I need the 90s."
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   I haven't used one of those since before the pandemic.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   I mean, probably in years.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   One of those.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   It's been a while.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   We have a...
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   My daughter's...
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   I'll talk.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   Oh, she's never seen one.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   She went over to her grandparents as little kids.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   (laughter)
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   She would play with the...
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   They were just like, "What is this thing?"
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   (laughter)
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   Okay, Jeff, I'm sorry.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   You're bad.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   So, all right.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   So two things.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   One is, I friggin' hate the rounded edge Samsung thing.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   Why?
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   It distorts.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   I don't like the feel of it.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   I just really hate that.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   I just do.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   It's also top heavy.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   So yours is...
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Yeah, why are we complaining about this?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   The curve points.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   But this being taller, it's even more awkward, I would say.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   I'm starting to think I hate this phone.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   I'm a bit of this.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   I am a bit of this.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   Certified.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Big guy.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   I just hate this phone.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   Just threw it away.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   (laughter)
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   So that was what...
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   How'd it be going berserk-o?
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   Well, how'd it be going berserk-o?
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   Is it all...
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   I'm funny.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   I'm funny.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   Oh, what's that?
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   Which is the...
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   You can do...
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   Workspace.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   Workspace.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Workspace.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Or you know it is G-spot or whatever it is.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   We know it's better on the Android 12th.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Oh, wait.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   Oh, wait.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Oh, just you wait and read it.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   (laughter)
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Okay, tell me what I have in the domain.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   So...
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   The problem was...
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   'Cause I have my personal domain is a workspace just so I can have the damn domain, right?
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   I don't have a staff of 20.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   I run an IT for me.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   It's just me.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   I am my own bad IT.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   And so I try to put it on and it says you must establish a work profile.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   And then it says, but you're not authorized to establish a work profile.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   You have to talk to your IT manager.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   Who's the IT manager?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   Me!
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   Can I find anything, anywhere, absolutely anything that tells me how to allow my own self to establish
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   the work profile, which I don't want anyway.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   I don't want this personal versus work thing.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   I hate it.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   It doesn't exist on my Android 12, on my 9.03 XL.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   Now it exists on this and it's getting in the way.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   And I was ready to throw out the window.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   I reinstalled things like five times.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   I was going nuts.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   I couldn't find it.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   And then a very nice Googler took pity on me and sent me a DM.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   I guess it was a DM.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   I guess it was a one with a private software.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   I want to be a product.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   Thank you, Googler, to tell me how to authorize myself to do what myself wants to do.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   But I still...
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   Wait, what?
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   I still don't want this whole work versus personal.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   Why does it exist on the Pixel 6 Pro?
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   Because it's Pro.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   Not on the same operating system on my 3A XL.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   I don't know.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   So I was getting pissed off and fed up.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   I was doing the same thing as Stacey.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   I was looking back at the five and the four even.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   I was then looking at the Pixel 6.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   I'm probably being silly.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.720]   Because, hey, I'm a silly guy.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   So I did get the RMA.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   I got the RMA right here.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   I can send it back.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   No, no, no.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   Because that's the only way I rest easy.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   Because I can get rid of this thing.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Wow.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   And so I got it.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   I probably won't return it because I feel kind of bad returning things.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   I've been done so with a laptop recently.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   And so I'll probably hold on to it.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   But I'm not as pleased as I should be.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   I haven't even put my Sim in it yet because I'm just not committed to it.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   Now, Mr. Howe, I made a good point about that whole top heavy visor part.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   It does feel OK if you put your finger right there up under it.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   Or you get a pop socket.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   Pop socket.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   I am far too old for a pop socket.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   Don't you ever pop socket?
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   I will send you the perfect pop socket.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   Well, I had it on my own phone.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   But now, yeah, I'm coming up with Jeff's perfect pop socket.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   That's what I'm going to be thinking of.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   It's all probably hold on to it.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   But I'm not happy about it.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   And so now I'm stuck with this thing for the next four years.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   Wait, snap that picture.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   That's what we need on the pop socket.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   Yes.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   I'm not happy about it.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   Got it.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   I thought we'd just get him a Frank Sinatra pop socket.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   We could put Bob.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   I think this is more, you know, present day value, Jeff.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   Don't live in the past when he was called a bum.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   This is a...
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   You spoke about the curved edges as well.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.120]   I like a flat edge phone just for a better grip because this phone is on this slippery
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.720]   and then you put those curved edges on it.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   Absolutely.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   And it distorts, what does it do to photos?
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   I hate it the way it does to text to the websites.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   What does it do to photos to have the curved edge on the screen itself?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.220]   I haven't noticed any type of distortion because I guess everything is sort of centered and
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.720]   not necessarily towards the edges.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Now it's going to drive you crazy.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   You like that.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   You, as soon as you can be throwing the phone down and saying, "I hate it."
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   I dig this phone.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   I just come from the 4XL, so this is a...
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   Me too.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   ...improvement for a hardware standpoint.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   I came from the 3B.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   My only BS now.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   My only BS now.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   My only BS has nothing to do with the phone.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   My only beef is the OS.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   You guys are just a punch-up.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   Jeff?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   Return it.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   Return it because I don't think we can handle you complaining if you keep it.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   Oh, no.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   Let's keep it because we can get segments.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   It's content.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   Yeah, it's content for the show.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   It's a regenerating wheel of content, Jeff.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   Meanwhile, I finally settled on a new...
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Oh.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   I got the Pixelbook Go.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   Good.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   Was that the one you returned?
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   No.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   Well, it's complicated.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   I got the CX9 and really disliked it.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   Oh, that's the Acer.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   That was really expensive too.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   So we got a refund for that.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   What do you like about the CX9?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   I thought it was a bad build.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   The screen was yellow.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   Oh, no.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   The word I hated.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   Okay.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   And when you have the convertible where the back raises up the keyboard?
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   It's kind of weird.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   The keyboard more wonky.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   I want a solid keyboard.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   So, man, I'm listening.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   I'm hearing my Android God in my head on my shoulder.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   Good Kevin.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   It's a good Kevin on your shoulder.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   Aboutcrumbucks.com.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   And so, he's been pushing the 713 spin.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   About pushing it.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   I want to say...
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   Remember, that's his favorite I think.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   It's very...
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   He likes it.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   He recommends it.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   He has a reasonable...
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   And it's the aspect ratio I want.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   So I went and I bought it.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   But I didn't open the box.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   Because I thought...
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   I don't know.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   I just don't know.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   So then I went and saw the Go.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   And then I went and saw it.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   And then I went and saw it.

[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   Well, how am I getting cars when I'm hungry?
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   Let's see.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   Apple has, this is a breaking story that just came out.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   And it's a huge story.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   As you know, Apple's been taking a lot of heat most recently
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   because they said third party repair companies can't replace
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   the screen on the iPhone 13.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   And if they do, the Face ID stops working.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   Apple changed its tune on that shortly after receiving a ton
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   of criticism.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   Today, they took the extra step.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   They announced that they are going to allow the general public
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   to repair their own phones.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   They're going to sell, this is something third party repair
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.720]   shops have been begging for for years.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   Apple fought in the right to repair bills in many state
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   legislatures.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   Apple's going to sell repair parts directly to the public.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   This is something I don't even think Google does this.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   It will also make repair guides available to the public.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   Apple said in a press release this morning, available first
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, soon to be followed by Mac
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   computers featuring M1 chips.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   Self-service repair will be available early next year
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   in the US expanded additional countries throughout 2022.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   The initial focus will be on screens, batteries and cameras
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   but will expand next year.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   Now I have to tell you, repairing an iPhone is a non-trivial thing.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   If you go to I fix it, you can see there's a lot of glue.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   But after you've completed your own repair, you can repair it.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   Now by the way, if they allow end users to do that,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   presumably that means you could also, as a third party repair
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   shop, get the same stuff.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Or I could buy it and bring it to a third party repair shop.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   After they've completed their own repair, they can return the
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   broken parts to an Apple store for store credit.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   Apple said it will offer more than 200 individual parts and
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   tools to help repair iPhone 12 and 13.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   This is stunning, complete reversal and the right, by the
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   way, the right thing to do.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Let's give them credit.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   This is going to get rid of geniuses.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   No, there still will be a market for geniuses.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   People will still have issues and bring it to the
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   but this is what a good, solid FCC that means business can do.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   Just the threat of that has been, has pushed them to make this
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   and that's good.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   It's also, let's give lots of credit to, right to repair
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   campaigners like Kyle Wiens, that I fix it and others who for a
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   long time really pushed for this to the media, which has been
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   very critical of Apple's unrepairable devices.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   I think this is amazing and correct.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   This is a good first step.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   But if this phone is ridiculously difficult to repair, what's
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   the point of having all of these?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   If it's not engineered for repair, right?
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.720]   Exactly.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   Well, this is, hey, look, maybe that's the next thing.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   They've made the battery.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   Well, no, in the most recent--
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   It's pretty easy to replace the battery.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   That's right.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   Yeah, so I think they're making, and this is all part of us.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   I think, okay, FTC, the EU, France actually passed a law
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   requiring this, so I know that nobody cares what France does
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   necessarily, but good.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   And it's a sustainability thing.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   People are getting, their consumers and customers are looking
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   at that, they're like--
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   I need to make this fully honest.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   I'm not necessarily all this toxic metals.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   So I think that's really good.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   Hey, kids, I'm old enough to remember when you could take out
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   your battery and your phone to carry around six of them.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   Me too.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   I repaired the battery.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   Thanks to I fix it, I repaired the battery and my iPhone, I made
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   my Pixel 4 XL, and you can do it.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Apple often has special tools in the Apple stores for these
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   kinds of repairs, but I suspect this is a first step.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   Maybe they'll be more repairable next year.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   We've been hating on them for a while for not doing this, and I
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   think it's a really good thing that they are.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   And I'd like to see Google follow suit.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   And usually when Apple does something, even if it's something
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   as dumb as taking away the headphone jack, other companies
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   follow suit.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   So let's not just Google, but Samsung and Motorola and other
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   companies.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   When your decision by the Pixel Go was it influenced by this
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   battery, Google allegedly won't release a new Pixel book next
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   year.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   No, I knew I was doing my beloved Pixel book.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   Oh, I loved it so much.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   It's the best machine, but it was with battery 98% 10 minutes
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   left.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   So I knew it was doomed.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   The keyboard was starting to get this is again the argument for
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   right to repair this although the other problem and I love I
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   also have this very nice last Pixel book.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   It's a great device.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.720]   The only other problem with it is that Google didn't guarantee
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   continued updates.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   I think they were now they've changed their tune on pixels on
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   the phones.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   So I'm hoping that they will do the same for Chrome.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   In fact, I think they did do the same for Chrome.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   Why not?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   I have a Chromebook.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   I have another Chromebook that's out of the prior one.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   Do you still use it?
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   In the office.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Yeah, it's my back.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   It's one reason not to.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   Too machine.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   Okay.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   Let's take a little break.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Everybody's got all the spleen, all the buy out.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   They feel better.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   Lots more spleen and buy all the comes.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   I wasn't particularly billius.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   I felt that.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.720]   No.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   I thought in the Jeff off here, I think Jeff stole one.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   I have a hard time being that way.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   You have to really piss me off.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   Oh.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   No, and there's no reason to be mad at the Pixel.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   It's just not for you.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   It's not for her.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   It's completely appropriate to return.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   Oh, really?
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   Your baby isn't ugly.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   This Pixel is lovely.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   It's just not for me.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   It's not your fault.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   It's mine that we're breaking up.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   Our show today brought to you by Nureva.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.720]   We're all getting back to work, but you still want to practice social distancing.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   You still want to be sensible in the office.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Do you have a huddle room?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   A big one?
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   Do you need some audio?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   There's a couple of choices.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.360]   Of course, you go to a pro AV company.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   And there you go.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   They will come in for the midsize and large rooms.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.520]   They'll come in with multiple components, mic speakers.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   They'll put them in the ceiling.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.920]   They'll spread them across the table.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.840]   Lots of cables.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.760]   You're going to have to have technicians not only to figure out what you need, but to
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   install it.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.560]   And then, yeah, even calibrate the system forever.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.680]   Installation could take days, tens of thousands of dollars per room for purchasing installation.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.600]   Yeah, you probably get a good result, but then you got all of those microphones.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.280]   You got to clean after every meeting.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.320]   It's just a nightmare.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.520]   Nureva is the right solution.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   It simplifies almost every aspect of audio conferencing.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.680]   So let's say instead of going to the pro AV solution, you went to Nureva.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.400]   Exceptional audio for rooms up to 25 by 25 feet.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.560]   That's with a single integrated microphone and speaker bar.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   If it's 30 to 50 feet, if it's a bigger room, get two bars, you can install them yourself.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.840]   It's just like installing a sound bar.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.800]   30 minutes, two screws, one cable.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   That's it.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.560]   It's an easy DIY project and it costs a small fraction of pro AV systems.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.000]   And I got to say Nureva is brilliant.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.920]   This microphone coverage, you might say, well, where's the microphones?
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:41.240]   They're in the device using Nureva's patented microphone mist technology, which gives you
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   using computational audio, true full room coverage.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.800]   Everyone's heard no matter where they move in the room, they can even face away from the
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.280]   microphone.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.520]   And it's continuously calibrating.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.440]   No expert has to come in and do it.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   In fact, you can control the whole thing from your Nureva console.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.800]   So if you have multiple rooms, a fleet of systems, easy, you can monitor, manage, adjust
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.160]   and scale.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.400]   You won't need any training.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.800]   It's so easy to use.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   It's just the great solution.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.280]   And only Nureva can do it because of their patented microphone mist technology.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:22.080]   I want you to check out Nureva NUR EVA.com.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.480]   It's the solution for these mid-size and large meeting and learning spaces.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.040]   And it's a so much better solution than the pro AV solution.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:39.400]   Nureva is changing the world of audio in meeting rooms by simplifying almost every aspect.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.600]   Nureva, go to Nureva.com/twit to learn more.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.000]   It's a great solution.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.560]   NUR EVA, Nureva.com/twit.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.880]   In Google, as you know, kind of an audio fiend.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.760]   Nureva's pretty darn amazing.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   What they're doing is incredible.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:07.960]   Thank you Nureva.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.400]   Did you see, I actually meant to talk about this on Sunday.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.320]   We had Parris Martyno who works for Jessica Lesson at the information.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.200]   We just didn't get around to it.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.320]   But I thought this was very interesting.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.760]   Jessica Lesson's husband, Sam, was at Facebook.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.720]   He was a Facebook vice president.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.760]   He had his own start-ups, a couple of them.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.200]   I got to know him then because I was a big fan of his start-up.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.760]   He is now a VC, Sam Lesson.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.960]   Always his father's footsteps.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.480]   I was a friend of his father.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.400]   Who is his father?
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.240]   Robert Lesson was a major investor, banker, investor.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.600]   I did not know that.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.760]   I did not know that.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   Sam was just a sweetheart.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.440]   I always thought Sam was smart and really nice.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:39:03.120]   He has his own investment, VC firm, slow ventures.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:08.160]   Instead of investing in start-ups and in companies, they've decided to start investing
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.840]   in creators.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:19.200]   They've joined a few individual investors spending $1.7 million for a 31-year-old YouTube
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.360]   personality.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.560]   Marina Mogilco.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   They didn't buy her.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.160]   She's not for sale.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   This sounds like trafficking.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   They invested in her.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.320]   They gave her $1.7 million in return for actually, I think a small, a 30-year employment contract
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.480]   or not contract, but a 30-year investment deal.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.120]   5% of her creator-related earnings.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.200]   Plus she makes over a certain amount.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.400]   Over a certain amount plus a percentage from any IP she develops.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.640]   It could be even longer.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.920]   She said, Marina said, "If I write a book, it's like a record deal.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.120]   It's a long deal."
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.440]   What do you think?
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.880]   Investing in people instead of in products or companies?
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.600]   I thought that's what all great employers do from the get-go.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   It's a good point.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   They always say we're investing in the team.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:21.280]   I think it's like scholarships in a way, and maybe we should look at it that way, where
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.080]   maybe you should pay back your scholarships only when you start making money.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.720]   Maybe you pay a little higher rate if you make a lot of money or something like that.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.800]   It's interesting.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.760]   It's also interesting to say this is a way to support a creator, which I like.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.440]   The problem is the underlying ways in which the creator actually makes the money to pay
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.920]   it back hasn't been revolutionized.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   So, you revolutionize one part of it where you can invest and give some money up front,
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.240]   and I think that could be interesting.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.560]   But I'd really like to see more innovation in how that creator in turn gets revenue for
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.560]   those 30 years.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.280]   Is this the same type of tactic for people to write books?
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.920]   No, it's not at all.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.160]   No, they get an advance.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.480]   It's advanced for a specific book.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.160]   It's advanced against royalties.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   It's the other way around, really.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.360]   Instead of you giving them 5%, they give you five or less.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.680]   But, per book, it's not a lot of money.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.720]   So this is different.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:22.360]   As you said, Jeff, Sam Lesson told Vice that they don't get any money unless she's making
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.720]   in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.600]   She takes that off the top, adding the number will adjust with inflation as well.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:37.400]   If she decides to become a lawyer or just gives up YouTube, she keeps the 1.7 million.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.360]   If she gets a Netflix deal or a job with the YouTube related to the creator economy, she
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.080]   has to give them 5%.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.400]   Five is, of course, much less than an agent would get.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.320]   But they're not making it.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.760]   I don't know how much they're helping her get the deals.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.040]   That's another question.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.160]   What do they do for this money?
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.520]   Is it basically, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   No, you got it.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   You got it.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.360]   What I was just going to say is this just a loan, but no one else would have against this
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.640]   so you're doing well in the sense that you have to pay it back.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.000]   Well, I think that's the right question, Stacey, because unless she's investing this in some
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.680]   way, why do you invest?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.920]   Why does the company take investment at all so they can grow faster than they would otherwise?
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.840]   What does the money do for her that lets her do more than she otherwise would do?
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.600]   Maybe it means she can hire a staff to help her make it worse off.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   I don't know.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.200]   I don't know if her be more efficient as a creator and just cut down a little bit of
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.000]   angst and stress from being a creator is where they can actually focus on doing the
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   job.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   I mean, the G use award.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.600]   And you could focus on riskier stuff in the hopes that it pays off in the future because
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.160]   you don't have to pay your bills today out of your creator funds, right?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.640]   So you can do longer, slower projects.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.960]   I mean, giving people runway is always good for those people, right?
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.440]   I mean, provided they do something.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   Provided they're focused, right?
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.680]   I'm like, if you gave me runway and I just spent it on chips and red books the whole
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.200]   time, maybe that's not great.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.840]   But, you know, if I built something.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   And actually Sam made the same point you made, and he said, even if you invest in startups,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.240]   you're investing in the people.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.440]   This is just making that explicit.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   It's interesting.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.720]   I mean, I think you are seeing something very different in the media scene.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   This is one way that the internet and YouTube have changed that and TikTok and others have
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.800]   changed that, which is, you know, when I, in mainstream media, when I was working in mainstream
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.360]   media, the last thing any company wanted to do is to promote a star because it meant
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.120]   that was going to cost them a lot of money.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.880]   They wanted to take that leverage.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.000]   And then you'd lose them.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.680]   So they wanted you to be a star, but they mixed feelings about the whole thing.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:58.560]   And in any event NBC saw its operations as more than any individual, right?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.480]   So, you know, maybe Tom Brokow was a star, but it was really a bunch of people.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.000]   And there was certainly star, star maker salaries, even more than she's getting being
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.320]   handed out, lots more than she's getting, being handed out.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.360]   But now you're investing, but in that case, you were the company that providing the infrastructure
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.320]   doing, you know, doing the back one, kind of like Twit is.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.400]   And now it's just you're saying, you know, go ahead, do whatever you do.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   This is your best story.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.680]   What a kind of wide-key YouTube too, in a way.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.240]   You're letting YouTube do all that stuff that normally NBC would have done.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.200]   What if Sam came to Hank and said, Hank, here's a million and a half.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   Hank was saying it's not a...
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.240]   I own 5% of you for the next 30 years.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.440]   Hank, we're talking about my son, who is a fairly successful TikTok channel, has already
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.120]   been approached by investors.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.680]   So there are definitely people out there who want to throw money at him and say, but
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   nothing quite so explicit is this.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.720]   I'll own 5% of you.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   5% of you.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.440]   What kind of returns is he's...
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.840]   What kind of returns is he promising?
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   I mean, look at that...
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.920]   Well, he hasn't done any deals yet, so he's signed a management deal with a company that
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.720]   does this, but mostly what they do is they get him ads, they get him revenue.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.800]   But there'd be people, big name people have come to him and said, we'd like to put money
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.080]   into you in some way.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.520]   For what's the good part of it?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.480]   Well, I don't know all of the deals.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   This guy's...
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.840]   My kid is going like crazy.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   I get...
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.480]   One of them was a product tie-in.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.200]   So we'll invest in a product that you're going to do.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.800]   He's going to start selling salt.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   Salt.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   That's the bestable thing.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   Well, I said, no, don't let them invest here.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.960]   I want to buy him.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   So I invest.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   His mother and I have invested in him.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:01.080]   That's a little friendlier investment too.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.760]   So I think this...
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   That's why I bring this up.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.960]   Not so much about Hank, but just in general, this is a new way of thinking about it.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   What makes it real?
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:11.960]   What makes it real?
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   Yes, it's a new way of thinking about it.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   So Hank...
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.520]   So let me put it this way then.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.640]   If Hank suddenly had a big wump of money, he could hire publicists to get his name
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   way out there.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   And he could...
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   He could...
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:30.240]   You know, to get him on the Today Show and do all that stuff and pump him, he could
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.640]   hire a production team to make more things across more platforms.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640]   I'm just trying to...
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   I'm just brainstorming here.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   He could...
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   What else could he...
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.160]   Well, he could then make more products than salts, right?
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   He could...
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.720]   Yeah, but that's what's so weird because again, you know, if NBC comes to me and says,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.480]   "We're going to pay you at $1.7 million a year to anchor the nightly news," they
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.360]   do everything except I do the hostage.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.360]   This is kind of the other way around.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   That's a cool one.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   You know, you do everything.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.000]   We're going to give you money, do whatever you want with that.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.040]   We're just going to take whatever happens.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.200]   That's a weird leap of faith and kind of a strange...
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.880]   Well, okay.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.880]   Hold on.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.560]   So think about it from the venture world, where you will have for every huge home run,
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.360]   you're going to have five of yours utterly fail, right?
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.240]   And then a couple make even and then one or two do like triple 5X maybe.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:30.560]   So if you think about investing in this creator, you've got a creator, you're going to take
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.240]   5% of them.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   Let's say she creates her own empire worth, you know, I don't know.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.640]   I'm trying to think of what's a...
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   Like 500 million.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   That's 5% of that.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   Well, that's kind of what they're saying.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.520]   And this is the vice article, "Slow Ventures is Close to Finishing Up the Paper with Work
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.920]   with More People It Will Be Investing in."
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:48:01.360]   Listen to this, "Hoping one of them becomes the next Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Kim Kardashian."
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.600]   Now, very different things.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.960]   Yeah, that's a little weird.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.440]   Well, don't, but look at someone like Reese Witherspoon 2012, I think it was.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.880]   She started her own production company.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.760]   And now it's worth like 900 million.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.400]   So if you funded Reese back in the day, you would fund that.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.120]   But the way you would fund that is you would make a deal to fund the production company.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.160]   These are just like, I believe in you as a person, whatever you're going to do.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.680]   But she's going to make it a piece of it.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.920]   Yeah, she's going to create a company around her stuff.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.120]   I mean, if they're giving me money, are they giving...
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.520]   Are they doing the deal with Stacey Higginbotham and the other?
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.400]   No, with SKP Labs LLC.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.320]   No, well, so that would be the latter to be more traditional.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:53.200]   I think about Spotify giving the, "Who's your daddy?"
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.880]   Host $20 million a year for three years.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.400]   That's a more traditional thing.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   We're paying you $20 million.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.360]   You're going to work for us and make a podcast for us.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.560]   And then we're going to get the benefit of that.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.000]   That would be that kind of investment into your production company.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.360]   It sounds more like if they had just said, "Here's a million bucks.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   Go do something."
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.520]   But you could do more than one thing then.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.400]   So then you're not tied to that one product.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.160]   So Stacey investing is Stacey.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.760]   So somebody could invest in your media property today.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.960]   And then you owe them back and you have appropriate of that.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.320]   But you could decide, "I want to start the Stacey Light Switch Company."
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.160]   And in the Sam Lesson deal, Sam would get a piece of that because it's related to IoT.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.400]   You're freer to start more ventures.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.280]   And if she's now, if she does a job, like if she's like, "You know what?
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.640]   This YouTube thing's not working out.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.960]   I'm going to go work for her."
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.320]   Apparently they don't get that.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   They don't get that.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   They don't get that.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   So if you have a real job for the kind of job.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.160]   Yeah, I'm sure the contract is more specific.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.920]   But what they've said is she could quit, become a lawyer.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.400]   They wouldn't get any of that.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   It's like her, whatever she does as a creator.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.280]   I'm sure that I would hope the contract would say, "You're going to keep doing it."
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   I don't know.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.320]   Normally you'd say, "And for that, we expect you to do YouTube for five years."
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.760]   There's just some type of a milestone.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.400]   I mean, but I don't -- it doesn't sound like it though.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.000]   It sounds like more like they're buying you.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.360]   They're buying a percentage of you.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   I'm like, "I don't know.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   I would be feeling weird saying I'd like to buy 5% of Ant Pruitt."
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   That would be a little bit weird.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.640]   But we don't know what the contract says.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.160]   We only know that they're trying to market to creators to tell them that this is a good
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.160]   deal.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.160]   Right.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.240]   I would more concrete.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.840]   I think about, again, from the IT perspective, like a CIO saying, "You know what?
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:49.440]   We really need to ramp things up and goes out and looks for an infrastructure manager
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.600]   or what have you to help really tighten things up between all of the different properties."
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.360]   And they hired this infrastructure manager and the infrastructure manager says, "I'm
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.840]   going to get this done, but I need you to just sign the checks every month so I can just
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.880]   make it happen regardless of the cost."
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.520]   And a lot of the big tech companies they're doing that, they just sign the checks because
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.160]   they need everything to run on time and no downtime and all of that good stuff.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.720]   They're invested in the vision of the people that they hire and they just continue to write
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.720]   the checks.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.800]   It sounds similar to me, but maybe that's still a little old school thinking.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.360]   But there's usually, you know, you're working for me.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.920]   I don't think that it sounds more open-ended than this, but I don't know.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.640]   Lesin says he thinks he's stumbled into the solution of one of society's longest standing
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.960]   and most burdensome issues debt.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.400]   He says, "So messed up that young people have all the equity value because they're
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.280]   the ones that are going to do the work, provide for the future."
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   Oh boy.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.600]   They have the future potential, but they don't have any of the cash.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.520]   So, so, reduce scholarships, please.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.520]   Yes.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.520]   Yes.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.600]   This gets close to that idea that, you know, you can invest in a college student and they'll
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.160]   go on and do things and give back some of their...
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.560]   This gets into basically what is glorified indentured servitude caps.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.560]   Yes.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.000]   That's kind of my feeling.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.480]   But Sam says, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.520]   It's the opposite of that."
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.520]   Or is it...
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   Of course, it's going to say that.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   ...patrilege.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.480]   Is it DaVinci and patronage?
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.880]   It's not patronage because they're taken 5%.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.320]   Right, I'd present it.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   So, it's not.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.840]   It's still an investment.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.000]   Even if it's a 30-year payout.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.160]   He says, Sam says, "I'd rather permanent because..."
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.600]   Well, that's a definite substitute.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.200]   Three years is too short a term.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.160]   He gives us an example.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:48.760]   You know, what if we'd done this with Jeff Bezos and then he made sure that he never
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.280]   made any money.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.920]   He just borrows forever so there's never a return because there's never a return.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.200]   You still don't get paid.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.160]   He says, "That's the only thing you have to avoid as an investor."
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.840]   So he says, "I would rather the deals be forever."
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.320]   If she starts her own company, that becomes a part of...
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.320]   Like if she becomes a lawyer and creates her own...
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.320]   No, I suspect...
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   We don't know.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.320]   It must be related.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.880]   I think it's related to being a creator.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.560]   She actually already has YouTube videos, language learning companies.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:27.720]   She has a $475 course she offers on how to start a YouTube channel.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.680]   So she's already monetizing.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.000]   I would guess that there's...
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.920]   We don't know the contract, but there's verbiage that kind of says, "In this area, if you
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.400]   do anything in this area, we take 5 percent."
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.160]   It says specifically, "But not if she quit YouTube or became a lawyer."
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.160]   So...
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.760]   I don't know.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.200]   It's a very interesting deal.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   Maybe we should get Sam on and ask him.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   That'd be great.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   It's really great.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.200]   He's been on Twitter.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   Mr. Howell.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   It's just a strange...
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:07.320]   I don't know if I like it or not.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.840]   You know, I don't.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.480]   If my son came to me and said, "Hey, I've got this offer," I would say no.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.920]   I would say don't do it.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.200]   Because of the 30-year term?
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.560]   I'd say, "Well, he doesn't need money."
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.840]   Well, he doesn't need money.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.840]   Well, he could give you much money.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.080]   But he could grow the business faster, Sam.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   With money.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   But I think it's better to fix that.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   But I agree.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.480]   You just feel psychologically, just realize it's always over your head.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.880]   You always owe somebody 5 percent of everything you do.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.680]   And I feel like if you'd better bootstrapping than taking that money and then owing somebody
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.200]   some unknown amount of money.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   You're not...
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   And then you're going to give it a moment.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   You're going to give it a moment.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   You guys...
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   There's no cap on it.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.480]   It's not like once you've paid back to 1.7, there's no cap.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.720]   You could give them billions if you made that money.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.720]   Like an advanced then.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.920]   So Angel and Vessin is a better idea?
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.000]   I mean, if somebody said, "I want to invest in a company that you're going to start Hank
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.320]   and we'll share the equity out of that," that's sensible.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.920]   It has a fence around it.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   It has a fence around.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.960]   Talk about man and space.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.440]   But I want to come back to the idea of scholarships.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.960]   Imagine if a scholarship fund were set up such that if you come out of school and you
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:23.120]   work in social justice as my daughter will and you never make a lot of money, you probably
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.360]   don't pay much back.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.160]   But you come out of school and you become a lawyer and you make a fortune.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.120]   You pay a higher proportion back.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.120]   But those are loans.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.720]   You pay higher interest rates.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.720]   Pardon me?
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.960]   But those are loans, right?
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.880]   Well, that's what we do now with student loans.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.400]   And just poor students take...
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.480]   Thank God I work in a state school.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.120]   So we cost a lot less.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.280]   We're as expensive as we live in New York.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.120]   Our students leave with debt.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.880]   And then they go out into a field where they're not going to make a lot of money at first
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.360]   because that's the way it works.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.320]   You pay your dues, et cetera.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.720]   And so the debt we leave students with is awful.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.560]   If we instead said we're investing in your future indeed, we're going to have to report
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.240]   your income, figure out how that works too when you get it off the clock.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.560]   But let's just imagine you will and properly.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:20.080]   And if you make this much money, you pay back this plus this much of the loan.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.720]   Have a slight scale, you will.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   You don't pay back.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.000]   Based on the success that you get from your degree.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.160]   And now the problem with that is then you'd only give loans slash scholarships to law
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.960]   students.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.640]   So the university would have to have some role in here to say, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.560]   We want a rounded student body.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.520]   But there's something in here in what Sam has done.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.320]   They've talked to education.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.960]   They've talked about doing this for kind of like what AmeriCorps does right now, which
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.160]   is it's not quite that way because AmeriCorps takes things like if you were a public teacher
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.560]   or a social worker, you get a delay in paying some of your student loans.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.800]   And I believe some of them are forgiven.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.760]   It's a big.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.000]   It's like the Peace Corps.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.720]   But it's a program for kids coming out of college to work in somewhere in America in a job that's
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   necessary.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   AmeriCorps actually funds journalists.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   It's a great idea.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   I love it.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.680]   I'd love to see the Peace Corps come back.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.880]   Well, it's not gone anywhere.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   It's still there, but I'd love to see it be more.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.880]   It's like it's still here.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:30.120]   Yeah, but I'd like to see it be cut part of like, I mean, I know people will.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   There are ways like.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.960]   I'd like to see compulsory public service.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.760]   Kid gets out of college for those two years to the go to the no.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   You don't like that idea?
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   I love that idea.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.000]   Did you go into the army?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.200]   No, but I would have gone into the Peace Corps.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.840]   If I'd had to look, no one's going to do it unless it's compulsory, not no one.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.840]   Most people are not going to do it unless it's compulsory.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.400]   If everybody doesn't have Facebook, you fool.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.720]   Yes, that's my plan, my evil plan to get rid of Facebook.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.480]   And then we're going to Iceland.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.360]   Speaking of Facebook, we're going to the new metaverse.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.240]   Wait till you see our Christmas card, by the way.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.080]   I can't wait till you see our Christmas card.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.920]   I'm not going to see any wait.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.760]   Our show today brought to you by Red Hat's podcast, Command Line Heroes.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.840]   I have been a fan of this.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:15.840]   I can't believe it.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.680]   They're in season eight.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.160]   They do such a great job.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:25.280]   And I want to give a lot of credit to the folks, not only in Red Hat, but to Sir on
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   your bar.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   I could does it.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   The host.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.400]   It is all about the stuff we love.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:39.480]   The epic, true tales of developers, programmers, hackers, geeks, and open source rebels who
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.960]   are revolutionizing the technology landscape.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.720]   It's a great way to both get a little history and to hear the current trends.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.680]   I think should listen to all eight seasons.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.960]   But the new season eight is really kind of a departure a little bit.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.480]   They're going to tackle one question from every angle.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   What is a robot?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.680]   Season eight is all about robots.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:07.240]   And so each episode kind of looks at robots from a different angle, different way is a
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.480]   robot a servant.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.520]   That's the first episode of the season.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.920]   A factory worker.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.600]   How about a prosthetic device, a vehicle?
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.720]   Why do we make robots that look like us?
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.120]   Can you trust robots?
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.240]   Or maybe we should be asking, can robots trust us?
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.800]   Science fiction's all about robots.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.920]   But actually, that science fiction's here.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:33.200]   There are robots already serving our needs.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.600]   Will they develop a mind of their own?
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.760]   Will they turn against us?
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.680]   Will they be the savior of our humanity?
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.160]   Or will they be our downfall robots in our midst?
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.680]   Season eight, a command line heroes.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.320]   Here's a little bit from the first episode.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.120]   Robot as Servant.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.240]   While making this season, we discovered a robot reality that's pretty removed from the
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.120]   robots we imagined.
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:03.480]   And yet, all those misguided ideas about what a robot should be actually shaped with robots
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   are.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:14.040]   And no robot fiction shaped things more than the story we told ourselves about robotic servants.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.320]   The servants are serving us every day.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.160]   I think you're going to like it.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:27.360]   The next episode, season eight is out now.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.900]   podcast, or anywhere you listen to podcasts, and I'll put a link in the show notes of
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:37.260]   twit.tv/twig, so you can go there that way too. Thanks to Command Line Heroes, and Red Hat
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:43.140]   for their support doing great stuff. Command Line Heroes.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:48.340]   All right, I am... You told me not to watch this before the show. What am I about to play
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.340]   here?
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:55.160]   You're gonna play a brilliant thing from
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.080]   the Iceland verse. You've seen it, everybody's seen it.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   Let it play.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:10.320]   Hi, and welcome to this very natural setting. Today, I want to talk about a revolutionary
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.720]   approach on how to connect our world without being super weird.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.880]   He looks a little like Mark, I guess.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.200]   Some said it's not possible.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.800]   Yeah, just wait.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:27.900]   Some said it's out of reach. To them, we say it's already here. Seriously, look, it's
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.900]   right here.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.960]   He's looking out the window at the ice.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:40.040]   What do we call this not so new chapter in human connectivity? The Iceland verse.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:48.440]   Enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets. In our open world experience, everything
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   is real.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.960]   You can't get out the door apparently.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.600]   And has been for millions of years.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.800]   That looks pretty cold, actually.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.040]   It's completely immersive.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   Oh, he's got a...
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.640]   With water, a face.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.840]   It's wet.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:15.800]   With humans to connect with.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   You're human, right?
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   You see, funny?
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.440]   He's in a hot spring.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.760]   There's real moss you can look at.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.840]   But please don't touch.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.240]   It's very delicate.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.800]   Skies you can see with your eyeballs.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.200]   The panic rocks you can caress.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.720]   Really big geysers you can observe from a safe distance.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.520]   Birds you can watch.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   They're really cute, but a bit stupid.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.920]   One horse you can stand near.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.840]   Like this one, that one, this one, that one.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   And even this one.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.320]   Horses you can rise with hair you can touch.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:04.000]   The Iceland verse is a world with possibilities so endless they'll be here forever.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:12.120]   So join us today or tomorrow or whenever we are really easy going.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.120]   Now, please enjoy our local.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.000]   The logo is the country of Iceland outlined.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Inspired by Iceland.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.160]   So this is 1.1 million views.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.760]   It's obviously inspired really not by Iceland but by Mark Zuckerberg's introduction of the
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.800]   metaverse so well done.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.880]   Apparently, Zuck has a response.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   He does indeed.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.880]   Yes.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.320]   He's at him and the lawyers are just him.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.080]   No, no, no, no, okay.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   You'll see it.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.080]   Okay.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.080]   Here it is.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.920]   He says, "Amazing.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.680]   I need to make a trip to the Iceland verse soon.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.240]   Glad you're wearing sunscreen too."
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.000]   Happy emoji rolling on the floor laughing.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.080]   And the sunscreen actually goes back to his photo in Hawaii of surfing with sunscreen.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080]   So, yeah.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   Okay.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.400]   That's good stuff.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.080]   Okay.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.320]   I was appreciative of the fact that they did say don't touch the moss because moss is very
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   delicate.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   Is that really?
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   You shouldn't touch moss.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   So you have learned something.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   And it's so fragile actually.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.720]   The air that surrounds moss is its own little biome.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.800]   So if you move moss from like one place to another place, it will suffer and sometimes
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.360]   it doesn't, a lot of times it dies just because it doesn't have the right.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   Wow.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   Touchy, touchy.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   I did not know that.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.760]   I like steward don't mess with Texas, but now I know don't mess with the moss.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.720]   Don't mess with the moss in Texas either.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.200]   The paperless office reducks.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.720]   Apparently, no one can get printers.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.480]   This is yet another supply.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:07.960]   We should have a instead of the change log, we now should have the supply chain nightmare.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:18.560]   Unit sales of ink, jet and laser printers fell 21% year over year in 2021.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.560]   Production constraints and logistic issues impeded shipment volumes and led to a 19.5%
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.360]   drop in the ink jet segment.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:33.720]   Remember ink jets, 19.9% business models down 16% laser market, 27%.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.080]   I guess we inherited some HP stock.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.720]   I wonder what happened to that.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.360]   A conica monolta cut its operating profit forecast by a third due to the tight supply
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.680]   of semiconductors and other materials.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.440]   Compounded by an explosion accident at its toner plants.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.080]   Oh no.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.240]   That's another thing that's happening.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.040]   These plants are blowing up.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.720]   This is just US based data or is it worldwide?
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   No worldwide.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   Global.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720]   Okay.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   Global.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   Actually, this is Western Europe in particular.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   I haven't seen the global data.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:13.080]   I wonder about just the use of paper day to day in business.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.760]   So much is paperless now in electronic.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.560]   Who the heck is printing and why?
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.640]   Even contracts are electronic now.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:28.000]   I'm trying to think of all the things we've printed.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.200]   Mostly contracts, shipping labels.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.520]   Someone asked me to fax something the other day.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.520]   Wow.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   Well, it's secure.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   Kinkos, is that open?
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:43.280]   Where do I have to plug my corded phone to plug in my fax machine?
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.920]   It's a festival of the past.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.000]   We don't even have a landline.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.760]   I mean, I couldn't fax from here even if I had a fax machine.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.520]   I'm like, you got to have a landline.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   I am tempted.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.000]   There's an open source project called paperless and an update of it.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.360]   Paperless dash N G which is software that's designed to go with any kind of document scanner.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.760]   And the idea is just scan everything you can, you know, all the pieces of paper, scan it
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.480]   to a server that you control.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.120]   Many printers will scan to a FTP or Google Drive or whatever.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   And then you can run this software on it.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.160]   It will OCR it.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   Turn it into text.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   Post office.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   The post office will do that with your incoming mail.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   Yes.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   Yeah, they do.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.760]   And then you now have, you can use search to find whatever you want.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   Now you have a whole database of all those documents.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.160]   And if you need to, you can just print it out.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:45.400]   And most people won't care that you took it, scanned it, destroyed the original and printed
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   it out.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.960]   So I'm kind of tempted to go the other way.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   Go paperless.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.240]   Yeah, get rid of it.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   I went to the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library two days ago because
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.640]   I love those life, but we had binocular Yale and I love rare book libraries.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   Aren't they great?
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.680]   There's a couple of books I could only get there.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:10.240]   There's one about the death of the last type foundry company.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.880]   Yale has a Gutenberg Bible.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.440]   I used to go and look at little knowing that someday I would meet Mr. Gutenberg himself.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   Exactly.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.680]   So I used V flat.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.640]   I'm going to join you.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:28.960]   I used V flat, which is a wonderful app that is like my scan, my wonderful Caesar scanner,
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   which I love.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Do you have a Caesar?
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   Oh, that's so funny.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.440]   We were talking about that to you this weekend.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.720]   I had forgotten something else when he said V flat.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.080]   So Caesar is the coolest thing ever.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.160]   Do you bring it to the library?
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   I have to.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.800]   No, you can't, but I bring books home and then the Caesar I could use to.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.280]   We should allow you to bring a Caesar and it looks like a desk lamp.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.440]   It really does.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.960]   It's minor, but you're in this.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960]   It's the greatest.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.680]   And that's the, that's the, there's, there's some that are simpler and cheaper than that.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.880]   But I, this is 500 bucks.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   I mean, that's less than a phone.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   Well, there's much cheaper.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   There's much cheaper than that.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.160]   If you go to the Caesar, like a hundred, a hundred fifty or something.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.840]   I just like the idea that this sits there like a desk lamp.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.160]   It's got built in lights.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   It senses the page turn.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.640]   So you can go a page every one and a half seconds.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.440]   So you just turn the whole book.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.600]   It flattens it out.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   It turns it into.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   And it does OCR.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.360]   I think this is so cool.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.360]   Your books.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   I can only get from the New York Public Library that are really expensive.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.800]   Two hundred fifty three hundred dollar academic books that I needed for my research.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.520]   And so the Caesar is a godsend.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.400]   So V flat does the same flattening to the page and everything off from the phone.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.760]   And so it flattens the page.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.680]   So can you take out your phone at these libraries and take them?
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   They encourage you to.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.920]   They say don't spend too much time here.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.960]   I got they reopened the library in November.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.560]   We're in November now.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.800]   So just now from pandemic.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]   Sorry.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.240]   Luckily got in the first day.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.400]   Why are they saying don't spend so much time there?
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.480]   Because they want to get more people in to see more things.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.640]   So they've a limited number of desks and limited number of documents.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.200]   And so I signed up for an hour or two hours.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.080]   And I found out that they're sold out through the end of the year.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.680]   I was lucky to get in.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.920]   And so I just take picture at picture at picture with V flat and then mark it all.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.160]   And it makes a PDF for the whole thing.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.760]   Set it to myself and print it out.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.240]   And I come home and it was beautiful.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   So you're right.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.760]   Here's the the Kickstarter.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.200]   This was a nine eighty nine.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.880]   This is a Caesar Caesar C Z U R dot com.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880]   They are great.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   The shine ultra I have.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880]   I've actually got two of them.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.000]   Because I wanted one for my office so I could go to the NYPL get a book over to the office.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.040]   And scan them there.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.720]   So but you can take a picture with this V flat software.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.240]   And I guess with a good pixel six phone, even though your poor wrist.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.280]   You'd be so flat and floppy and heavy.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.080]   You could get a pretty good picture and then the V.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.440]   Is V flat on the phone?
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.600]   Is it a phone software?
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600]   Is it?
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.600]   It's great.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   We have V flat scan.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   Nice.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600]   Absolutely love it.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.360]   So Caesar, I recommend highly, highly, highly.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.840]   It sounds like the V flat.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.160]   You don't really need it.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.720]   No, because if you want to do a hundred pages, you don't want to hold your because your wrist
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.720]   with your wrist.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.720]   The Caesar is so smart.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.280]   As you say, it knows when you turn the page.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   It also has a foot pedal if you want that.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280]   I just stopped my foot.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.080]   That was awesome.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   And if you want to stand over it, the Caesar has a little TV screen on the top.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.080]   Oh, I see.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   You can see what it's taking a picture of.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.080]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.680]   But you can also do it on the big screen.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.920]   The only thing that Caesar should be is it should come with a memory card so you don't
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.120]   need a laptop.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.760]   And I can only use it with the Mac you gave me for the show.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.080]   I can't use it with my Chromebook.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.600]   It's an only problem with it.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.640]   But thank you for the Mac.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.440]   I do think that libraries should just let you scan the dang thing.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.600]   I guess they may feel like that violates their agreement with the publishers.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600]   No, it's not bad.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   It seems upset.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.400]   It's too much plugged in stuff.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   Sorry, Stacey, go ahead.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   Oh, the power.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   Oh, all right.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.240]   Let me just scan this Leonard Taill professor for journalistic cuts.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.440]   Innovation, because I keep losing the screen.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.360]   Yeah, too close to document.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   There we go.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.320]   All right, look at that.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.040]   Turns it into text automatically.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.600]   Very cool.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.320]   That's what I do with Adobe Sign and Scan.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.600]   Yeah, there's a lot of ways to do this now.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.160]   I mean, these devices are so smart.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.120]   Let me look at the text, see if it got it right.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.000]   The Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.640]   It even has a little musical note.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   Hey, Craig Newmark.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.320]   Graduates, look, it did a perfect job.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.880]   Look at that.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.280]   Did you use the character recognition?
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.720]   Yeah, I just pressed the button.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720]   That's awesome.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.720]   That's amazing.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.880]   I totally thought you were talking about something else with V-flat.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.960]   There's a photography gear called V-flat for setting up bounce.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.120]   And can't you do this with just the camera built in to the phone?
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.000]   It won't regularize the curve of the book.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Right.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.200]   Character recognition.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.600]   Yeah, it will.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.080]   It'll do that the lens.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   It just does a lens.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   It's a lens.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.240]   But also being able to just mark a bunch of pages and turn it into a PDF.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.720]   No, that's cool.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   That's V-flat.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   Yeah, all right.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720]   V-flat's very good.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.120]   You know what you don't want to get?
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120]   Glad.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120]   How do you like your Pixel Buds?
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   Did you send those back?
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120]   You still...
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   Well, here's the other thing.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   The Andy Lurnie of Twig.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.680]   Because of Jason Howell, I bought a pair, which I actually...
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   They're fine.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   Occasionally they'll cut out a little bit.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.080]   I put it in my front pocket, my back pocket, because apparently I have ass steel that keeps
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.760]   the signal from going through.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   Whatever.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   Fine.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   At least they work most time.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.640]   So then I buy the phone and I end up getting a second pair.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   I figure out the freebies.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   Right.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   The freebie.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.120]   But then when I returned the phone, of course it was returned.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.920]   It said, "Oh, it's too late to return the Pixel Buds because they came earlier than your
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   phone."
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.720]   I'm not going to send the phone now, so much nicks.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.960]   But yeah, since you mentioned it, I was just about that.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:34.400]   Well, just be glad you didn't get the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.360]   There's quite an extensive piece in Android Central, Chris Wiedel writing.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.800]   And a lot of people confirming, and Samsung even kind of by the backdoor confirming, they're
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.200]   causing ear infections.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.480]   Oh, my Lord.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.120]   We're not sure why.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.840]   Perhaps it's the nickel in the context we know nickel can cause problems.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.320]   Perhaps it's this new material, new plastic they're using, Acrylate.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.880]   But there's something about these.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.600]   And this guy, this poor guy, never had an ear infection in his life.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.600]   I don't know.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.600]   I had never heard of this.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.440]   He says, "I always, but when I get any earbuds, I clean them out of the box."
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.520]   I've never done that.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   Never done that.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   Just stick them right in the ear.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.760]   I've seen this there or one in the box.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.120]   He says, "Properly cleaning headphones and earphones out of the box or after use can help
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.280]   you prevent residual germs and other foreign matter from manufacturing getting in your
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   mouth."
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.480]   So he was a little bit more careful than we are.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   Clearly.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.600]   He wore them for 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.840]   The same evening, my ears were a little itchy.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   That's all?
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.160]   Yeah, a year infection.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.040]   He took them out, went away after treatment.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.600]   He actually went to the doctor eventually.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.760]   Try saying maybe, "Is it the earbuds?
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.400]   Let me just put it in one ear, do some phone calls.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.520]   Got an infection in one ear.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.000]   Now if you're at all squeamish, close your eyes because I'm going to show what his ears
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.360]   looked like.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.320]   This is before and this is after."
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   They were so swollen.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.960]   The ear doctor had to wait to look into his ear.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   It's over.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.320]   Jeff, you can look.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.840]   At many others are starting to report this.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.000]   So a Samsung may have an issue.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   Okay.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.440]   If we know that nickel causes infections for people.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.200]   Those are in the context.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.680]   That's just a little spot.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.600]   Yeah, nickel is an allergic, dirtitis issue for like 5% of the population.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.600]   I don't know.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.680]   Why would they even go that route?
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.480]   Well, because it's cheap, available and it's a common thing.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   So what they do now mostly is just tell people, "Hey, this is just this little dot."
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.280]   It's the peanut of metals.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:50.160]   Anyway, I just thought I'd mention this and I'm sure there are many, many people using
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   these.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.480]   I love the old Galaxy buds.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   They were great.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.720]   In fact, I was considering getting the prune, but now I might wait and see what Samsung is.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:03.480]   I got an infection because I was going out constantly in the pandemic and doing calls
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   and stuff.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.200]   So I finally stopped using the two lungs.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.680]   This is the show.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.360]   Otherwise, I use the computer speaker.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.600]   It reminds me of the Steve Martin movie, "The Jerk," when he invented the glasses holders
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.440]   that made it very easy to put your glasses on and take off.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.080]   But what he didn't realize is it was going to make people cross-eyed because they'd be
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.240]   staring at them.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.080]   I feel like we just all kind of said, "Yeah, put the headphones in your ear.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.160]   Let's just all stick our headphones in our ear."
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.000]   Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.640]   You know, I wonder if I've actually had some sort of infection because just recently my
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.440]   left ear was having some issues.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.440]   There you go.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   There you go.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.720]   Because I wear these earbuds a lot throughout the day.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   Just listening to podcasts and books and whatnot.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.400]   Maybe that's what it was.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.680]   I thought someone had cut me in my sleep in my ear because I wouldn't put it past us.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.760]   Little paranoid are we there, Dad?
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.760]   Jeez.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.920]   What'd you do to Queen Pruitt?
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.320]   That's the question we need to be asking that.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.520]   I didn't say it was Queen Pruitt.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   Hello.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.160]   You said that.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.760]   I didn't.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.840]   Quentin Perrinx.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.520]   But after me next.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.520]   No.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.440]   Handwritten script for Pulp Fiction.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:26.400]   He is going to auction it off as an NFT.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:33.120]   The NFT is pitched as secret means its contents will be viewable exclusively by the owner.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:39.000]   You will get excerpt from Tarantino's original handwritten script for the film accompanied
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.800]   by commentary.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.600]   Miramax, a company that made the film said, "Hold on there."
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.840]   Tuesday they filed a copyright infringement.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   Those I don't.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.840]   They weren't there cut.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.720]   Tarantino's lawyer said, "Miramax is wrong, plain and simple.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.640]   He has the right to sell NFTs of his handwritten script for Pulp Fiction.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.320]   His ham fisted attempt to prevent him from doing so will fail."
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.680]   Apparently it's in his contract that he could do that.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.520]   That seems like a pretty tight line to walk.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.880]   Miramax attorney accused Tarantino's team of a deliberate premeditated short term money
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.320]   grab.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.280]   Oh God.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.240]   I actually would buy that NFT but I'm sure it will be way out of my price range.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.840]   I think that's a really cool NFT.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.680]   Anyway, the suit is on in the Central District of California.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.520]   Should we do a Google change log here already?
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520]   Oh wow.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.520]   Play the horns.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   Oh come on.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.360]   Last week's show was three hours.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   Do it.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.280]   I was having so much fun.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   Play the horn.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.360]   You still hurt once you're in a group.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   No.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.320]   I'm not saying we have to stop the show.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.600]   I'm just going to get this out of the way.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.840]   Google says it's improving the fingerprint scanner performance.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   Awful.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840]   Joyful.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840]   Joyful.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840]   The Pixel 6.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840]   That's mean.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.840]   You shouldn't make fun of the handicap.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.840]   That's so mean.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.920]   It's not your fault that you have floppy risks.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.920]   You know what?
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.040]   I just enjoyed a delicious piece of pumpkin pie and I was feeling guilty but now I feel
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.040]   great.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.120]   You were able to hold it in your hand or did you have to have some help?
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.120]   Come closer.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.280]   Let me use my hand.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.280]   I think so.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.560]   I think she could handle a chiffon pie in her wrist.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.600]   But anything pumpkin is pretty heavy.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   It's pretty heavy.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   It's dense.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   Oh, but I mean it was good.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   I'm jealous now.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600]   It was delicious.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.440]   It was still slightly warm with whipped cream.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440]   Google has rolled it out.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440]   She made it.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.600]   That's nice.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.840]   So it just came out of the oven.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.840]   She's homesick.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.840]   Well, I cooled enough.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.920]   And she's making pie.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.080]   Some might say she's not sick enough.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.480]   I kind of them get much succession last week.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480]   We've before last.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   I love succession.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.640]   I'm so glad it's back.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.160]   So back to the Google change.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.120]   We're going to stretch this.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.880]   We are so easily distracted.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.720]   The update is 15 megabytes.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.440]   It's been confirmed in a post on the Google support page which vaguely notes.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.120]   It includes minor bug fixes and some fingerprint sensor performance improvements for Pixel
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.800]   6 and Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.200]   Now, when I read this, I checked.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.040]   I had an update on my Google 5 Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040]   Did the update.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.400]   I wasn't having problems in the first place.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.640]   I didn't notice any change in the scanner's performance.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640]   I'm not alone.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   I'm not alone.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.080]   I'll be very curious.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:54.320]   It could be just, you know, Dieter Bohn said it's not so much faster or more accurate.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.040]   But even best case, it's still slower than an S20.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.440]   So yeah.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   There you go.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   There you go.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   It will.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   It started rolling out today.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.680]   We'll continue over the next week and you got it.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.240]   So is it just spin?
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.520]   If it's not any faster or more accurate, it's just spin talk from Google?
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.720]   Well, how could you fix it in software if it's slow?
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.560]   Well, maybe there is some software that takes some time or maybe they've improved the...
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.560]   I don't know.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:22.560]   I don't know.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.280]   I'm assuming it's like memory allocation or something to make it faster.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   Who knows?
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.280]   Who knows?
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.080]   They could have changed the encryption scheme.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.000]   Didn't they say there was some sort of encryption issue?
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.360]   They said they implied that it was slowing down for security reasons.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.760]   What would be more accurate or something?
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760]   Anyway, we'll see.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   And let us know.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.320]   And if, Jarrim, if you've applied it, let me know if you see a distance.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.720]   I don't have it yet.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.520]   Greg said he thinks it was just a placebo effect.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.520]   Right.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.040]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:01.400]   Google's latest map features could help you avoid holiday shopping crowds.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.400]   If you...
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   I've thought this...
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.800]   I didn't think it was new, but I guess it is new.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.720]   Google will now tell you how busy a place is.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   It's not just because it's pressing.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   It's just pressing.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   It's people.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.720]   Ah, seeing the map is new.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.720]   Okay.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.960]   So if you go to a restaurants page and you Google it, you'll see in the little info card,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960]   you'll see some of them.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   Right.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.320]   You get a graph of the busiest times and all that.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.960]   But if they show it on the map, that's actually pretty cool.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   Yeah, avoid the crowds.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   It'd be nice.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.200]   A new feature that combines live, busyness trends to help you instantly spot when a neighborhood
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.400]   a part of town is near or at its busiest.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.840]   So if you're not a fan of crowds, you can avoid that, a holiday fair, something like
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   that.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.600]   So if you're in Fotap on a neighborhood to see how busy it is at different times of
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.160]   days, we've seen that along with restaurants, shops, recreational places like museums.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.280]   So this is the busyness graph.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.240]   Google says it's thinking about the introverts.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.240]   That's awesome.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.240]   You know what?
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.760]   It figures that the introverts would be best served by Google, right?
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.720]   You'll be able to navigate malls, airports and transit stations in a snap.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.120]   This is so that Google's been working on for some time is indoor navigation.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.720]   There's also a directory tab now, and that's expanding.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.360]   So and that's iOS and Android.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.200]   So you'll be able to tap the directory tab when you're in a place and see more about
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.760]   what's in that place, which is pretty cool.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.000]   And how they host can save time on grocery shopping.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.280]   It's pick up with Google Maps, first launched in Portland with Select Fred Myers stores once
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.800]   you place your order from the retailer, pick up with Google Maps, lets you track your
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.040]   order status, share your ETA, let the store know you're there, all from within the app.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.720]   It now includes more Kroger family stores like Kroger's, Fries, Ralphs and Mariano's
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.880]   2000 store locations, more than 30 states across the US.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   People use it actually.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:03.240]   I mean, it's so, you know, it's for grocery store that offers pickup, right?
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.080]   I'm just thinking that even if it does offer pickup, the grocery store employees who are
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.640]   responsible for gathering stuff and pulling it out to your car, they may be kind of like
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.880]   not participating.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.400]   Well, but when they're done, it'll tell you they've got your packages.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.080]   So then you can, you can go.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:22.200]   I'm just like, I don't think they care if I show up.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.560]   They're like, well, that lady's been waiting for 10 minutes.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.960]   People according to Google, people who use pickup with Google Maps typically wait less
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.360]   than five minutes for their groceries.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.520]   So wow, that's in the change log.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.360]   So it must be true.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   Here we go.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:44.920]   Google meet calls hosted by premium workspace tiers can now host up to 500 participants.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:45.920]   Sure.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.920]   Sure.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.160]   And I'm worried about this one.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.960]   Did you write this ant slow week, y'all?
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   No.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   Maybe, maybe.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.480]   I know that y'all is a dead given with this.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.880]   It must be, you know what it is?
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.400]   It's, it's a, it's ray gun posing is it?
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:09.280]   And how says Android TV apps can now be remotely installed from your phone via a new place
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.960]   to our feature.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.460]   Okay.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.960]   And finally, Google camera 8.4.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   It's not out yet.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.920]   It's coming out soon brings timer light, disabling exposure controls and more to older pixel
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.920]   phones.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.360]   So this is not a benefit so much to the Pixel six.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.120]   These already are here for Pixel six, but this is what this is what Stacy can get around
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.120]   our pixel to.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.920]   It's one of the things that Google does really well, which is slowly, you know, trickling
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.000]   all the features in the flagship phones down to the earlier phones.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.960]   The APK is just rolling out now, not, not widely rolled out, but you should be getting
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.600]   a new camera soon.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:57.200]   Look for camera 8.4 and that my friends is the Google change law.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   See?
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.080]   See a very efficient change law.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   Yeah, that was so efficient.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.520]   I don't even know what to do with myself.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.360]   I couldn't even buy new slippers.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.160]   I wasn't shopping for slippers this time.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160]   We got a lot of feedback about those.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160]   Yes.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.320]   People, people really identified with it and everybody had their own favorites and yeah,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   it's good.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.360]   I actually got some good shopping ideas.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360]   Twitter is bought.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.080]   You should call a little bean and be like, hey, we got some research for you, man.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   I think I've used Threadr for a long time.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.520]   It allowed you to send a tweet storm to Threadr.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520]   They'd thread it in the app.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.920]   You could easily read it.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.560]   Twitter's bought them.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.840]   Ooh, can I make Twitter blue better?
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   Right.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.640]   That's actually pretty awesome.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.800]   Yeah, still digging Twitter blue a week later.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.800]   Yes.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.880]   I've used my $3 worth already.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.880]   Yeah, that's how I feel.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   For sure.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   Turn the show.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.280]   I like that news.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.720]   I do like that news feature.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.880]   I think that's really good.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:01.880]   I missed Mezzles.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:07.640]   And you know, I just did the threading thing, the prettier threads for a Corey Doctorow thread
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   because he does a lot of threads.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640]   Yes.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   Worth while.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640]   And that was nice.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.960]   And I liked how it gave credit for everybody.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.560]   I thought that was a good experience.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   I haven't tried that yet.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.720]   I do threads on Friday nights at the ballgame so the family can see what's going on.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.720]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.960]   But it's not pretty.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:34.240]   I don't know.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.600]   There's a bunch of Twitter stories, but I don't think any of these are that interesting.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.880]   According to Pew, 42% of US readers read Twitter primarily for entertainment.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.440]   20% for news.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.880]   One third of his users visit Twitter less than once a week.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.040]   Two thirds at least weekly.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.200]   I went berserk on a headline on one version of the story that, you know, well, gee, not
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.880]   many people are on Twitter.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:58.240]   It's a constantly a mass media way to look at it.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.520]   Like everybody has to be there.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.520]   Right.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.520]   And then it becomes one thing.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.880]   No, there's individuals there.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.520]   It's like saying not everybody's in my town.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.120]   So the town might as well die.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.960]   We're not going for ratings here, folks.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.520]   This ain't signed for.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.520]   Fair enough.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.200]   I'm curious about the API because Twitter, of course, you know, went with an API, then
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200]   went away.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.000]   Jack is talking about about the distributed role.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.680]   And there was a Washington Post column saying I'd pay for Twitter if it did this.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.120]   And I tweeted and say what you want is what Jack's going to do with blue sky, which is
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.480]   to create structure.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.400]   And Jack came back in and said exactly on Twitter.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.840]   Now, what do you like Twitter?
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.800]   You get engagements from the boss.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.320]   The boss.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.480]   Because this idea that this what I said was the speech layer becomes the commodity layer
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.080]   and the value add becomes where you do things.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:54.040]   So I wonder about the Twitter API is distributed future, said the verge.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:59.200]   I'm not sure what's really that different, but if they're going back to it'd be interesting
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:05.040]   to see Twitter returning to a strong API, what people could build on top of it.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.800]   Is that the beginning of blue sky in essence?
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.960]   So here's the past meet in the future.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:17.480]   There are 13 surviving copies of the United States Constitution's original 1787 print
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   run.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.000]   It is going for sale going up for sale at South of East tomorrow.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.960]   There is an NFT.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:30.120]   Well, that's the time you're getting the idea.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.520]   Do you know what a DAO is?
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.680]   A decentralized autonomous organization.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.200]   These are created using crypto based systems, most commonly Ethereum.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:48.480]   There is a constitution DAO, a consortium assembling a bid for this constitution.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.920]   Now I don't know who will get it.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:55.560]   They are up to $30 million in this DAO.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.760]   They're going for $35 million.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.760]   Wow.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:03.960]   Then they'll buy the actual thing and find an appropriate place to display it.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   Well, that's the question.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   What happens?
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   They're not going to be TFT if they're buying the thing.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   What happens?
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.440]   I mean, the contribution.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.000]   Yeah, but who gets the thing?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.880]   The organization, the DAO, will find...
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.320]   Hey, CUNY would be a fine place to put it.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   A place to display the action.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:29.160]   The organizers say, "They intend to put the Constitution in the hands of the people."
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.160]   Okay.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:34.880]   They say they'll place the document out for public view with the help of an esteemed partner
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.280]   unnamed if their bid succeeds.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.080]   Now, of course, you can go to the National Archives where...
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.080]   Was there any...
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.080]   You see the handwritten one.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.560]   This is one of the original...
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.200]   ...the first run of the printing that night.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.160]   That's kind of cool.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.320]   Is this web three?
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.520]   I think this is kind of like web three.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.280]   We have not talked about web three.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280]   So should we...
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.880]   What's web three, sir?
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.880]   That's a good question.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880]   Hi.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.880]   Stacey?
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.120]   I'm not ready.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.120]   I did not read all.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.600]   I just was like, "You know what?
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   No.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.600]   Not today, Satan.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.840]   I mean, by today, I met last week when all this stuff came out."
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.840]   No.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.840]   No.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.600]   You know, I think it's hubris to think that we ever even hit web two.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.080]   Gutenberg years, 1475, we're at webstill.0001.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.840]   We don't know what this is.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:27.520]   So here at Ethereum.org is a practical comparison of web two versus web three.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.200]   On web two, Twitter can censor any account or tweet.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:37.000]   On web three, web three tweets would be un-sensurable because control is decentralized.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000]   It's kind of like that.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   Just what we need.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.520]   Well, but that's what the Twitter blue sky is, right?
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:45.520]   Well, if we're on blockchain, really, you couldn't get rid of it.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   But no.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   I guess in the distributed world.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   True.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.680]   In web two, payment services can decide not to allow payments for certain types of work.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.560]   See only fans.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.160]   But three payment apps require no personal data and cannot prevent payments.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.560]   And if you go through those things under the ages of, we got to get rid of all this evil
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.960]   stuff on the internet.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:06.960]   Ransomware.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:07.960]   You want to get rid of?
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.200]   Well, it's good for ransomware.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200]   Yep.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.440]   Servers and web two servers for gig economy apps could go down and affect worker income.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.200]   Happens all the time.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.560]   Web three servers can't go down because they use Ethereum as decentralized network of thousands
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.440]   of computers as their back end.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:33.040]   The fundamental unit of web three is the DAP, the distributed application.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.400]   The idea is to provide a little tap into you.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.800]   It's pretty nice.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   That's good.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.560]   Only you and I got it, but that's good.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   Exactly.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.800]   Casey, you have any idea what we're talking about?
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:45.800]   I do.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.720]   Isn't that like a hair cream or something?
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.280]   It was a real creamer.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   I'll just give you a little flavor of what you're talking about here.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   Oops.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:09.280]   Now, there's a happy accident, an accident that could lead to opportunity.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.280]   But then he had to take off his hat.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.280]   Oh, no.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.280]   Not here.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:37.280]   Oh, you're never a hands-on greasy.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:57.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.280]   I'm not a hands-on.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.880]   You do call me floppy wrists.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.880]   Maybe I should.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.880]   You should.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.040]   This is your opportunity.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.240]   What greasy hair?
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.240]   What do you want to say?
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.600]   Go ahead.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:25.880]   So it's a decentralized net that is backed up by a blockchain, basically, I guess.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.280]   And I don't mind the idea.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.280]   I think it's a good, probably a good idea.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   All we have to get on and talk about it is our Mr. Web--
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280]   What?
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   The indie Web.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280]   Mr. Indie Web.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   Oh, Kevin Marks.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280]   Kevin Marks.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   Oh, Mr. Marks.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   Yeah, he has-- I'll read it eventually.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.280]   I just was waiting for--
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   It's kind of one of those, you know, it's another one of those things.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:36:00.280]   Anyway, watch tomorrow the Sotheby's auction to see if the Ethereum Dow gets the Constitution down.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:07.280]   Is the idea of Web 3, something that normals will be able to get?
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   Well, you know, when you already have access to that, there's some browsers like Brave
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   that support a technology called IPFS, which is a IP-based file system that's distributed.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   And so stuff that's living on IPFS, the interplanetary file system, doesn't live any one spot, can
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   be everywhere.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   And so has some of the same benefits.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.280]   I think it's kind of a first attempt at Web 3 IPFS.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.280]   And so if you have a Brave browser, you can go to an IPFS site or see it.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.280]   You could see it.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   It exists.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   Yeah, I run Brave.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   Run in Brave right now.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.280]   So you actually-- one of the things you may be-- unless you've turned it off, you may actually
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   be hosting some IPFS content.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280]   Okay.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Because you're running Brave.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   You did miss a big important, I think, if I may be sub-old in this non-democracy dictator.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.280]   Important, careful numbers.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   Tell me.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.280]   The first one, because one of the things that drives some of us nuts about Twitter is you
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.280]   go-- you read a tweet, then you go off to do what it was, which is to read the article,
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.280]   then you come back and then it moves all the tweets.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.280]   Oh, I have mixed feelings.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.280]   I want you to explain this to me.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   Because on the one hand, usually in Tweet Deck, I'll turn on the feature where it's auto-scrolling.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   I like it.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.280]   It's like a ticker.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.280]   But is that what this is?
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.280]   On the Twitter app itself and on the web, it would just suddenly refresh.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280]   And you were in the middle of reading something.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280]   Oh, I don't like that.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.280]   No, no, no, no.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.280]   So now you have to-- which I've wanted for ages.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.280]   Thank you, Jack.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.280]   I wanted to explicitly say, now refresh the top.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   So now it says, lots of new tweets above.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.280]   You want to go there?
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   Yes.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280]   Click there.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280]   It won't let me go up.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280]   It's there.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.280]   So you're in control.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280]   It didn't used to do that.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280]   I never had that issue.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.280]   Instagram did that, but Twitter did that.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.280]   But Instagram does that all the time.
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.280]   It's annoying.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.280]   Maybe it does it on my phone, but not on the web or vice versa.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   Kind of a bug.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.280]   I think that's a bad thing.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   And I'm glad they took it out.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.280]   Because that's just a bad user experience for content you're reading.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.280]   It is.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   It is.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   Terrible experience.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.280]   So what are you doing?
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   Reading the articles, Jeff.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.280]   I put that one in there.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   By the way, I found a little trick.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   Twitter.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   If you notice the things in the rundown that have a space in front of them, it's because
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.760]   if you do that and then you cut and paste the headline in, it'll pick up the style of
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   the spreadsheet.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.280]   I used to spend all this time trying to change the font and change the line.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   Really?
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280]   Do that.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.960]   If you just put the space in first or anything in first, type in first, and then paste the
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.920]   headline in, it fits in the format.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.920]   It's changed my Twitter.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   Very nice.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.920]   Nice.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:50.920]   Thank you.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920]   Thank you.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   Very nice for a rundown.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.920]   I thought nobody else in the world could possibly care about this.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.920]   You could run down the world.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.920]   You're right.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   Nobody else would.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.920]   Okay.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.920]   Good.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.920]   He's excited.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.920]   I know he is.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.480]   Substack says it has, this is actually surprising, more than one million paid subscriptions.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.080]   This was also part of the Revolution.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920]   Twitter bought a newsletter company review.js.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.240]   I think a lot of people are thinking that the next big thing is newsletters, which I find
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.040]   difficult to understand.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.040]   I agree.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.040]   That's what I...
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.040]   Should be ready already?
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.200]   But one million paid subscribers, and it tends to be like five bucks, right?
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.720]   Top 10 writers on Substack collectively generate $20 million in annual revenue.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   Wow.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.360]   That's up from last year, $7 million.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360]   That's great.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.360]   So...
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.360]   That's not all...
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.800]   So, sub-stacks taking part of that, or is that the revenue generated for a sub-stack?
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.000]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   I assume that's...
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   I think that's gross.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   I bet that's gross.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   And sub-stack takes some portion of it.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   How much does sub-stack take?
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   Not very much, right?
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]   It's under 15 minutes.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   It's not a huge amount.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   It's a small amount, which is good.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.880]   Meanwhile, big media strikes back at sub-stack.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.600]   This is an Axios story.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.240]   Make sure from new publishing platforms has finally pushed newsrooms.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:23.120]   See Jeff Jarvis, to create programs that give writers more pay autonomy and flexibility.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.840]   Oh, no!
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   Oh, no!
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.920]   It'll Sam Russell come and give you $1.7 million.
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.920]   Okay.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:38.320]   The Atlantic rolled out its newsletter program.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.960]   In fact, didn't they?
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.960]   Who did they bring in?
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:41.960]   Somebody...
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   They brought us a big note.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.960]   I can't remember.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960]   You know, the Atlantic's...
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:50.200]   I subscribed to the Atlantic for a year, but it's a case of too much.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.200]   It's a lot of content.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.200]   Way too much of this.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.000]   So what they've done is they've added more and more content.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.400]   New York Times has a opinion newsletter's behind its paywall.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.400]   The hook.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.400]   The newsletter based startup that focuses on covering people in power.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.400]   It's really smart people there.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.680]   But the hook I might subscribe to.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.680]   Julie Ioffee.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.680]   Oh.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.440]   There were some really good writers there.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]   I used to...
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.440]   Borders.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   Yeah, Puck is a good name.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440]   It is.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.440]   Puck.news.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440]   A legendary name.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.440]   I used to...
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.440]   Wasn't there a Puck magazine?
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.440]   I used to subscribe, I think.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.720]   It was Suck magazine.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720]   Suck.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720]   That's right.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.720]   That was Web 1.0.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:29.720]   That was the very early Web.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.720]   Suck.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.520]   Adam Riecox was there.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.520]   Yep.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.520]   Joey Anath.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.520]   Well, I remember that.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.320]   That is a long time ago.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.320]   I remember that.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.960]   I was on the board of the company that acquired Suck plastic.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.400]   I had rest in peace.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.200]   Wow.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:52.640]   I would guess that Suck is probably on the Internet archives.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.600]   Remember the motto of fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun?
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.600]   That was a great...
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600]   It was just a great...
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.600]   I missed that kind of snark, honestly.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.600]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.600]   The register is still sort of...
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.600]   Adam Riecox was there.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.120]   Roger's caden head wrote for it.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.120]   Wow.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.440]   I missed that.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.480]   Carl Stedman...
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:23.400]   Was he the Carl Stedman who illustrated the...
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:28.360]   Was that the Stedman who illustrated the Tunderems Thompson novels?
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.840]   I don't know.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.400]   Anyway, it's all dead links all the way down, unfortunately.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.080]   Is nothing that's preserved?
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.080]   Yep.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   I think it's a different Stedman.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   Anyway...
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.080]   Way back machine.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   I haven't looked there.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.480]   JP Morgan sues Tesla after a...
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.720]   For $162 million after Elon's tweets...
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   Elo.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.920]   How soon do you think this will be resolved?
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.480]   There's a shared deal.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.040]   Because this is going on from 2018 or something like that.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.080]   This goes back to the tweets when they said that he was going to take it private, right?
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.080]   2018.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:14.760]   The SEC slapped him on the wrist, but now the real punishment comes.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.520]   If Tesla's share price...
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.880]   Wow.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.480]   It's unusual for a Wall Street bank to sue such a high profile client.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.880]   But it's only $162 million, right?
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.200]   So that's why I'm like, how long will this last?
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.920]   Because they fart $162 million.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.320]   Oh, oh wait.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.680]   So this is more complicated.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.760]   There's an options agreement.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.880]   If Tesla's share price was at or above the strike price of $560 on the day, the warrants
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:50.040]   expired June and July 2021, it would OJP Morgan the difference between the share price on
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.160]   that date and $560.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.960]   So the stock was worth more than $600 by June.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.920]   So it would have been that $40 difference per share.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.600]   But in addition, they won $162 million.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   Oh.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   In addition.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.600]   In addition, because of Elon's...
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:07.600]   That's a lot of money.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.640]   ...airants tweet that he might take Tesla private at $420, get it?
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.120]   $420 a share.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.720]   Oh, I hate.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.760]   I misread that.
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.600]   Anyway, that's a lot of money.
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   That's not just $160 million.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.600]   It could be a lot.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.600]   It could be a lot of money.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.600]   Okay.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.640]   Can I ask you an unrelated question?
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   Yes.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.280]   Do you still use your remarkable?
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:36.800]   I love my remarkable and I lent it to some guy named Micah Sargent and it's never been
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.800]   seen again.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   What is that?
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   No.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.600]   Micah asked me the same question.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.600]   You love it.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:44.600]   I'm thinking of getting it.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:48.720]   And I said, I would love it more if I were more prone to taking handwritten notes because
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.160]   that's what it's really for is handwritten notes.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.600]   And I just don't.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.800]   So he said, well, I do all the time.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:54.800]   I said, well, take it.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.120]   See if you like it.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.520]   And that's the last time.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:58.520]   And the rest is history.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:44:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.880]   I just never used it.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.120]   I love the remarkable.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120]   Yes.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.120]   And I didn't have the problems.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.080]   You did Jeff of getting into my phone or my computer.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.760]   It was very easy to do that.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.920]   Yeah, I thought it was great.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.640]   But again, I'm not probably the wrong market.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.640]   So I don't know.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.440]   Maybe you're much more the right market for it.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.000]   And I think you should ask Leo if he likes his coffee machine.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.480]   Maybe he'll lend it to you.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.960]   What are your thoughts on this coffee machine?
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.440]   You know, why don't you borrow it and see if you like that.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.440]   By the way, Elon is not done tweeting.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:34.520]   This is in his response to the JP Morgan lawsuit.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.520]   Oh, no.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.880]   Dude, and this was on the 14th.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.680]   This was two days ago.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.480]   Dude inflation 420 has gone up by 69.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.280]   Oh, man.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:53.200]   Just trolling.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.200]   He's the guy.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.800]   He's like a 60s like a 12 year old.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.240]   You know, people have soured on him quite a bit.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:07.640]   But you know, he's being sued by JP Morgan.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.040]   And I bet many like legitimate, well, I shouldn't say that.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040]   I don't know.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.040]   Never mind.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.840]   All right, let's take a break and come back with our picks of the week.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:16.840]   How about that?
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:22.400]   We don't want a three hour episode.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:28.640]   It's just floppy risks.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.640]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.640]   You know, I'm not.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.640]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.480]   I don't mean to be mean at all.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   I want that in a t-shirt.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.120]   Thank you, Mr. I accept my new name.
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.120]   Good.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120]   Thank you.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.040]   Lord, take it in the spirit, which is intended with this.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040]   He was like affectionate.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.240]   I should not have said that.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.360]   Absolutely should not have said that.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.360]   But it was pretty funny.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.360]   So I did.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.480]   I always err on the side of funny.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.680]   Picks coming up in just a bit.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.480]   Our show today brought to you by Stripe.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.640]   And you're the community manager of Club Twit.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.840]   One of the decisions we made that really was the right decision was to use Stripe for
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.480]   our payment platform.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:11.160]   And I can hardly recommend and I know because if it weren't a great payment platform, my
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.080]   wife would let me know because she would have to deal with it.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:18.320]   Use of adaptive businesses, choose Stripe as their payments platform.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   Why?
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.400]   Because with Stripe, businesses can easily optimize their payment infrastructure, simplify their
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.880]   expansion plans, create new revenue streams, all to help them grow and initiate change
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.520]   rather than having to react to it.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.720]   I think Stripe is amazing.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.720]   So I'm not alone.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:38.480]   Lots of people use Stripe Shopify Postmates Twilio.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.640]   And let me give you an example.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:43.720]   One thing Stripe does so many things well.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.480]   There's one thing that can make a huge difference, the authorization rates.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:55.360]   So Twilio was using Stripe and was able to, because of Stripe, increase its authorization
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.200]   rates by 10%.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.200]   They did an AB test.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.400]   They actually were testing other global payment processors.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.280]   Stripe did the same thing for Postmates.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:11.680]   They increased their authorization rates, $70 million in additional revenue.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.880]   That's what a big difference.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:20.280]   Rejected credit cards is one big way that companies lose money.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.120]   Stripe is better.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.200]   We launched ClubTwit this year using Stripe.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.000]   It's seamless in accepting payments and issuing refunds.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.320]   We couldn't be happier.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.640]   In fact, one of the things we love about it is it works in 135 different currencies and
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640]   payment methods.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.120]   So it's very flexible.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.800]   We have listeners all over the world.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.600]   They can all use Stripe.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.200]   That's us focus on our business.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.480]   Producing shows like this.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:48.480]   While Stripe handles the business of payments and money movement, it's just really great.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.640]   I love this feature.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.320]   I know, Lisa, it does.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.360]   Toggle the little switch that turns on Stripe Climate.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.600]   You can direct a fraction of your revenue to help scale emerging carbon-renewable technologies
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.880]   in just a few clicks.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:05.000]   We've been looking for easy ways to do that.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.120]   This is one way we do it.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.360]   It's just great.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.760]   Whether you're an online or in-person retailer or software platform or marketplace or like
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.760]   us as a subscriptions business, go to Stripe.com to learn more about how Stripe could support
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.720]   your business today.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.560]   S-T-R-I-P-E.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.560]   Stripe.com.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.320]   You guarantee you if you buy stuff online, you use it every single day I know I do.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.000]   I'm always happy when I see Stripe.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.920]   I think this is one of the reasons Stripe works well because your customers go, "Yo,
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.920]   yeah, Stripe.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.640]   Just at Stripe.com," to learn more and get started today.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.640]   We trust it.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.640]   We love it.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:41.640]   You should too.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.640]   Stripe.com.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.480]   Stay see Higg and Botham.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:53.120]   The day-stacy thing is the Mozilla privacy not included list.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.080]   I did not put the link in.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.680]   Every year for the last five years, Mozilla puts out the privacy not included list, which
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:07.520]   is basically just a list of gadgets and are they creepy?
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.800]   We did this last year.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.360]   I remember this.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360]   Yes.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.360]   Yes.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.280]   Basically, the least creepy, well, they've done so many more, but they've let like 147
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.680]   products and services and it's pretty awesome.
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:26.280]   So before you buy or use, you can see how they rate in privacy.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280]   Love you?
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.800]   So good behaving privacy things in the smart home.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.760]   Yufi has some devices, especially those with local storage.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.400]   NetAppmo, Netamo, I don't know how do you say it.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.760]   Garmin is pretty good.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:48.920]   Oh, gee, the Amazon ring drone camera privacy not so good on that.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920]   What is the product?
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.920]   Not awesome.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.920]   Not awesome.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.760]   But like your iRobot Roomba is pretty good.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:55.000]   Apple HomePod mini.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000]   Interesting.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]   Interesting.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.760]   So yeah, so go through this.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   It's fun.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.800]   And what I didn't know and I have this week on the show, I'll tell you, I have the lead
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.760]   researcher from this Jen Caltrader on the show.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.840]   And she was explaining that the worst device that she had discovered this year was the
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:18.440]   NordicTrack skier device because not only do they take your data, do they use it to market
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.520]   to you, but they also use it to like sell it to other people.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:28.760]   NordicTrack's privacy policy, they say, is an exercise in awful.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.760]   So yeah, so you know, just I always like drawing attention to this because I think it's they
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.200]   evaluate both privacy, but they also evaluate basic security.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200]   This is really good.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.280]   Yeah, there's three tabs privacy, security and AI.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.280]   And so this is really good.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.800]   Yeah, this is really good.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.800]   Yeah, a lot of things I use, including my Peloton biker on this list.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.800]   So I'm going to.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:58.760]   And I didn't realize this, but the woman who does it, Jen, who does this, she's a gadget
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.760]   head.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:02.480]   We spent like forever talking about robots and the gadgets she uses and like.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:08.080]   So this is not just by you can kind of tell like the person who did this is not just like
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.840]   she evaluates things based on what they offer like, Hey, if you give up a lot of data, what
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:13.840]   do you get in return?
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.800]   So I thought that was actually kind of nice because a lot of times you get these things
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.800]   written by people who are like, I will not share my data with anyone.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.360]   Or they're just not realistic.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.640]   This is good to know.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:35.960]   And you know, maybe you want to put your peloton in a sealed room instead of listening
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.720]   to your conversations.
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:42.000]   Yeah, this is really interesting stuff.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000]   Foundation at Mozilla.org.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.440]   Actually, if you just Google, as I did Mozilla privacy, not included, you will find the guide.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.440]   Good idea.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.480]   Stacey, does it put links in?
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:55.920]   Because she's all about privacy.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.480]   It hurt her wrist.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480]   Give her a break.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.800]   Yes, my wrist are too floppy for putting in links.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:03.640]   It just, it just wouldn't work.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.440]   Now I know why you typed the way you do.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440]   All right.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.440]   The weight comes down on the table.
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.680]   It's like a seal, actually.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.680]   It's like, just, yes.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.960]   So, punish is a keyboard.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:16.960]   No.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:23.960]   Just wherever the figure is full, you know, that's what I'll type.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.720]   Jeff, number of the week, my friend.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.280]   I am so thrilled about this one.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.320]   I am so happy about this one.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:32.840]   I get to do a gadget and a little bit of history too.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:42.080]   So, the Logitech Popkeys keyboard has programmable emoji keys.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.080]   And you can pop them off, I guess.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.280]   You can pop them off and put on different emojis.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.280]   Oh, no.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.680]   Hey, that keyboard's so much.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.680]   It's really ugly.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:50.680]   That's, it's ugly.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:53.320]   You know, I meant like the Logitech to be.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:56.040]   Those particular Logitech keyboards, I freaking hate them.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.720]   They're so uncomfortable to type on.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.720]   But okay, go on.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.280]   I know, but this is still a great idea.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.800]   And what it says is, now it comes by a hoty printer.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:06.480]   Like it's kind of, instead of the, remember on the old IBM PC's, they had a function key
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480]   row on the right.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.480]   Now you've got an emoji key row.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480]   Oh, geez.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480]   That's the point.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480]   It's emojis.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480]   I love it.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]   That's awesome.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.760]   So what it says too is that emojis are a new alphabet.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760]   The whole entire country.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.760]   Totally, sure.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760]   Gutenberg age.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:23.760]   Ah, Gutenberg.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:24.760]   Right.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:28.760]   It was all about the alphabet that we had and everything that worked toward, the book that
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:34.840]   I went to Columbia to read was about the last type founder in America that made alphabets
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   and then came postscript, right, which just made turns, letters into shapes and everything
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.240]   was kind of the same.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:46.800]   And then come emojis and memes, which become new alphabets, new structures for expression.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:51.640]   And so now they become, they get, they get honor next to the alphabet.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.640]   I love this.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.440]   It's also interesting that this, which is the most industrial era device for data entry
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:02.920]   has become now a fashion item.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.560]   I also wonder if five emoji keys is enough.
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.720]   I really, no, this is the first step.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:08.720]   I need more.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:11.320]   I really need the numeric keypad.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.360]   Hey, Jeff, I was going to tell you about this because I'm reading it now and it's pretty
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.360]   good.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.160]   And this feels like something you might be interested in.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:20.600]   And it's called the writing of the gods, the race to decode the Rosetta stone.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.600]   Ooh.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.440]   When you start talking, I heard about that one.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.440]   Ooh.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.000]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.320]   It's surprisingly interesting.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.840]   I don't want to give too much away, but it's about the race to figure out what it meant
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:36.240]   and decode it.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.760]   And it's really well written.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.240]   It's really engaging and you all should get it on the Rosetta stone in the British Museum.
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:47.800]   And it's really amazing because it unlocked these ancient languages because I can't remember
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:49.960]   what it was Sumerian and hieroglyphics.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.040]   And I can't remember, but I think it was three or four languages.
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:56:01.720]   The same thing in each language and knowing one, we were able to encode and decipher.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:02.960]   Yeah, there's a lot of it.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.520]   I mean, there's a lot like, I think of you, Jeff, with Gutenberg on like, there's just
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.440]   the subject of writing, like in what it means to people in how it develops and what jobs
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.480]   it needs to perform for different people.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:17.520]   I just thought it was really interesting.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.520]   I appreciate the recommendation.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.520]   It's good.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.520]   And it's kind of like a detective.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.160]   I love that kind of book, actually.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.160]   I do too.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.160]   There you go.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:32.800]   The other thing about the type writer is what really brought the keyboard into our consciousness
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:33.800]   for writing.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.160]   And people at first didn't trust type documents because anybody could forge it.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.160]   You don't know.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.160]   I recognize your handwriting.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.160]   I don't know what this thing is.
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.160]   You kind of make it up.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160]   It's the same as really printing.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:50.920]   People were distrustful at first because that's the reflex, just like Leo.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.720]   And so I want to name like Princess Floppy Rists.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:56.360]   I need to be this so percave.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.840]   So, so, so, so if you want, you can have that one.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.840]   That's different connotations.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.840]   It would be more insulting.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.600]   The, anyway, the type, so the type where you think about it, I just read this recently.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:16.360]   I can't remember who said it, but the typewriter was the final nail in the coffin of the scribe.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.360]   Interesting.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.840]   The scribes kept working until the typewriter came along and then all bureaucracies switched
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:21.840]   to typewriter pages.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.440]   They could do it themselves and that's the end of that.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.560]   Except in the medical practice because doctors still have scribes.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.400]   So now they dictate.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.000]   Some of them still do have them though, but you're right.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000]   They mostly dictate.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.200]   You might want to go to a more modern doctor's station.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.120]   When you go to the doctor, there's somebody sitting there writing down what the doctor says.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:46.360]   No, not most doctors, but my, okay, well, that was 15 years ago.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.360]   My OB/OB/OB/Gents.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.360]   That's cute.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360]   I want to go to a doctor more recently, Stacy.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.360]   That's cute.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.000]   I don't go to the doctor, so I have no idea.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.080]   That's what's wrong with my wrists, my old fashioned doctor.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.680]   Yeah, I think you can see an orthopod for those wrists.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.000]   I know orthopod.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.040]   Um, Aunt Pruitt, what do you got?
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.040]   Oh, man.
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:11.920]   One of our listeners of the show, Ms. Tanya Wyman sent in a suggestion and I said, "This
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.640]   is a great picture week."
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:20.200]   And it is to follow a gentleman named David Lee on Instagram who does some absolutely
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:25.480]   beautiful wildlife photography, all with the super telephoto lens.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:26.480]   Ooh.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.520]   So he's getting just ridiculous detail.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:29.520]   Beautiful.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:34.320]   And just, you can tell these patient because none of these shots are just simple shots you
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.520]   grab in wildlife.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:40.760]   So I wanted to give a shout out to David Lee on Instagram.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:42.840]   And then I also wanted to shout out Lynn's Rental.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:47.480]   So Lynn's Rental has helped me with the show a couple of times and I got an email from
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:50.240]   them since I'd been using them for years.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:55.520]   They now have a keeper program to where you can rent some stuff from them.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.040]   But if you decide to keep it, they got in simple and easy way to buy it from them with
[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.960]   a discounted rate.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:07.760]   And I think that's pretty good considering photography gear can be quite expensive and
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:13.000]   at least you can try it out before you decide, "Hey, yeah, I want to buy it."
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.400]   So shout out to them.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   Next.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.960]   I just wanted to say good luck to the squad, the high school football team.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:23.760]   They're going into round two.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.240]   But they won't play off.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.240]   Stay wise.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.240]   Last week.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.240]   Nice.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:31.280]   And we're just talking about my camera and I shot this video with that.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.760]   It was a foggy night at the football team.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.400]   It was so foggy.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:36.400]   Wow.
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.400]   It was so much atmosphere.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:40.400]   They won 37 and nothing.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.400]   Yeah, it was pretty.
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:42.840]   Oh, they beat up on those guys.
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.800]   Yeah, but this week is probably going to be a lot tougher.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.320]   So we're going to give them a shout out and just rooting for these kids.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:52.120]   They weren't really, really hard and the coach and staff is going to go.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.520]   You go Rancho Katati.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:55.520]   We're all.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.520]   Look at that fog.
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:57.520]   Wow.
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.320]   That kind of adds some mystery to the whole thing.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.240]   That was a lot of fun.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.240]   That's really cool.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.240]   A lot of fun.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.120]   Some drama.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.800]   Thank you, Ant Pruitt.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.800]   Thank you.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.560]   Thanks to all of you.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:13.800]   We couldn't do this show without the great contributions of all three of you.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:18.440]   Ant Pruitt, host of Hands On Photography, twit.tv/hop.
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.440]   That's right.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.920]   Community manager at the Twit Discord, our club twit.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.600]   You got an event coming up on Friday.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:27.600]   That is correct.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.600]   Hey, can I tell y'all?
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:30.600]   That would be yes.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.600]   Go right ahead.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.600]   Okay.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.600]   Y'all.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.600]   It is Stacy's Sci-Fi Crazy Book Club.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.600]   It has many money.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:41.960]   But we are reading All Systems Red.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.880]   And if you're like, "Oh my God, it's Friday, Stacy, at 4 o'clock, there's no way."
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.120]   This book is a hundred pages.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:48.720]   You can get through it.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.720]   Yes.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.720]   It's a novella.
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:54.360]   So it's not too late to join us and talk about it.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.240]   And feel free to drop on the Discord and be like Stacy.
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.600]   Here's what I expect from your book club because I'm sitting here going, "How thoughtful
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.600]   do we want to be?"
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.880]   But it's going to be a good time.
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:07.120]   Bring snacks, get yourself some beverages.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:08.560]   We're going to have fun.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.960]   I look forward to it.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.680]   What time and how do we do it?
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.680]   This will be at 4 p.m. Pacific time.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.360]   I don't know what that is in UTC.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.000]   7 p.m. Eastern, 2400 UTC is at midnight.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.320]   Oh, he's so good.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.320]   He's so good.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.640]   But yeah, this is Friday and it will be available to our club Twitch members only in the Discord.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.640]   So do you go to the live section and have to watch it?
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.640]   There will be a video section there under the Club Twitch event that you just click on
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.640]   and it'll pop up the video of Ms. Higginbotham and I chatting about the book.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.680]   Okay, we'll take some questions and I'm going to join that.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.600]   He is one organized SOB that anti-year is.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.080]   He's scheduling me for March.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.080]   Yay.
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.080]   Yay.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:59.400]   Well, we had to have time to fireproof the Discord before we were at the end.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.720]   This is all part of Club Twitch.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.080]   This is what we were really hoping to do with Club Twitch, which is make you more than just
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.080]   the podcast.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.240]   $7 a month does get you ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.280]   But then you get access to the Discord too, which is really a great community of its own.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:20.280]   Lots of stuff going on and there's conversations not just about the shows, but we have topics
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.320]   in all the geek topics, anime and autos and beer and books and coding and comics and data
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:30.200]   science and food and gaming and that's just through the G's.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.280]   So you can go on in there and meet great people, have a great conversation.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.480]   There's even a discussion of people wanting some coaching about IT careers and stuff like
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.040]   that and it's just community advice.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.400]   I might go in there and hang out during the World Chess Championship which is coming up
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.920]   next week.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.000]   We can do some of that too in our chess.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.760]   At least you didn't say Sudoku.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:53.600]   No, I can't wait to the Sudoku.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.000]   Somebody did suggest that for the Discord.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000]   Oh Lord.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000]   I'm like, I don't know how to do this.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   Quiet room.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.440]   You also get the Twit Plus feed which has stuff that happens before and after every show.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:13.240]   Go to Twit.tv/clubtwit to join and really the main purpose of it, well, you know, I
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.040]   have to say the main purpose of it is just to get our community together and have fun.
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:21.040]   But the money helps us quite a bit in keeping everything on the air and keeping everything
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.880]   flowing, paying the lights and the rent and all that stuff.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.960]   So thank you to all our club Twit members and please, if you want to join Stacey and her
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:32.000]   book club, go to Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.360]   It's month to month.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.920]   So worst case, you join it for a month.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:36.920]   See if you like it.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.760]   You can quit it anytime.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.040]   We don't even have a book for December since I hadn't, I was going to wait and see how
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.880]   this goes.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.280]   So everybody must go and join it.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.520]   And be nice.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:49.520]   That's the other part.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.520]   Oh, you know, that's the beauty.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.920]   By the way, I just want to say that's the beauty of it.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.840]   I don't know if it's because you have to pay seven bucks to get in or if it's just, but
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.440]   it's our great community.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.680]   And I've never, it's never been a problem anywhere in there.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:03.680]   It's been wonderful.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.680]   They have disagreements, but they've been respectable disagreements.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.160]   Absolutely cool to see it.
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.120]   And, you know, I thought we're going to have to have moderators and stuff and we haven't
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.760]   because it's just a great place to hang.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.760]   So if you're looking for a social network that is just about being social and learning
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.760]   and stuff, it's a great place to go.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:26.760]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, the about 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern, 2
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:27.760]   p.m. Eastern.
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:28.760]   It's a great place to go.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.760]   And I'll say, I'm not going to do that.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.760]   I'm not going to do that.
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:31.760]   I'm not going to do that.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:32.760]   I'm not going to do that.
