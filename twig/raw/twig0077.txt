[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.760]   Tripunne from smarterware.org.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   Hey, Gina.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.960]   Hello.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.600]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.400]   How's it going?
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.600]   Good.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.680]   You feeling better?
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.280]   Much better.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.000]   Much better today.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.640]   Much more tripper.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   Quick recovery.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   Quick recovery.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.680]   She had pertussis.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.120]   Yes.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.200]   I'm still coughing a little bit.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.960]   I will mute when I do that.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   OK.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.360]   I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.720]   Thank you.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.600]   Aren't you glad you're not where Jeff is right now?
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.520]   Show you.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.080]   Is it snowing?
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.040]   No, it's over now.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.520]   But there was the view outside my window.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.280]   That's pretty, though.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120]   That's pretty.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.920]   That's nice.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.080]   So I guess you're too far south to get the blizzard
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.440]   they're getting in Boston.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.240]   Yeah, we got about 7/8 inches, 9 inches.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   I'm going out your way.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.000]   Going to do Regis and Kelly on Tuesday.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760]   No, you're not going to see me and I'm so hurt.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.520]   Well, I could see you, but it would have to--
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   would have breakfast.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.960]   Oh, I'd do that.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.800]   Because it's a red eye.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   I get there a Monday morning.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.400]   And then we're Hurst Monday afternoon.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.880]   Then scramble around New York City
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.320]   trying to find bits and pieces to make the demos work.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.560]   Because Gelman always says, well, what about that?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.000]   You need a toilet for that to work.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.280]   OK.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   Hey, we forgot to pitch him.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.960]   We forgot to pitch him the ice scuba.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   That's the little thing that cleans your toilet.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.480]   It's like the eye robot from my robot.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.000]   Better add that to the list.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880]   They love toilet cleaning devices.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.560]   Also with us.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.600]   Kevin Marks, he is from TummelVision.tv.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.480]   And an expert on all this.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.520]   And just to give you-- because you're
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.040]   going to get the lead story on this one, which is that Chrome,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   no longer is going to support h.264.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520]   And to give you some backstory on this,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.200]   Kevin was involved in the development of QuickTime at Apple
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.520]   Computer, iChat at Apple Computer.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.800]   He went to Google and worked at Google for a while.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.080]   I think was it Google Profiles or Standard?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah, I'm under it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.560]   I was going to say, I should link Google Profiles.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.000]   But the two main things I worked on.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880]   And then most recently at British Telecom,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.080]   where he worked on Ribbit, which is also
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   a kind of streaming standard.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.080]   So this is the guy who knows this stuff.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   So what's the story?
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.160]   Why drop what is absolutely a standard h.264 from Chrome?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.320]   Well, it's just-- you can look at the history of this.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   So the challenge has always been, how do we
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.440]   do video on computers?
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.520]   And that's been fought over for a long time.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   There were a whole bunch of rival standards.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.440]   You know, a real player, Windows, Media, and QuickTime.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.600]   We're fighting it out for most of the 2000s and the late '90s.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.520]   And then Apple then said, OK, we'll work to standardize this.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.440]   And we'll work with the MPEG group
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.400]   and move from pushing QuickTime primarily to pushing MPEG-4
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.120]   and standardized on that.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.920]   And the MPEG-4 far format is largely based on QuickTime.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.200]   And then while I was there, they held up a release of QuickTime
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.760]   explicitly to get better terms out of the MPEG licensing
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   association so that you could actually ship it
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.560]   without having an infinitely increasing royalty.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.440]   This is MPEG-L-A.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.040]   Is that who it is?
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.360]   Yes, MPEG-L-A has what they call a patent pool.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   Basically, they collect all the patents that
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.360]   relate to a particular technology.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.720]   Then they issue invoices to people saying,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.120]   we will license these patents for this.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.880]   And then they divide it up between the patent holders.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.720]   There was concern last year that MPEG-L-A--
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   the royalties are fairly cheap right now.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.960]   Might raise the royalties suddenly.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.320]   They made a promise, no, we never will.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000]   I mean, they kind of reassured everybody.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   There's a bunch of different royalties
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.040]   on different bits of this.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.960]   So there were royalty agreements in place up until this year,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.360]   I think, that were so much a year.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.240]   Basically, when Apple sort of held them to account,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.160]   it was they put a cap on the royalties.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.560]   So you don't have to pay more than x million a year,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.120]   however many decoders you ship.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.680]   And that was something that they did
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   so that they wouldn't have an infinite expense for this.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   And that meant that any sufficiently large company
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   could adopt this without and know exactly what their cost would
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.200]   be.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.960]   So that's one of the reasons that Adobe and Microsoft
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.720]   adopted H.264 as well, because it had known costs.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   And the other part was that it was standardized
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.720]   with consumer electronics.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.040]   And there's lots of hardware out there
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   that generates it and supports it.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   Well, we should point out that if you're watching our video,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.120]   you're watching--
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.840]   it's streaming anyway.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.480]   You're watching H.264 in a flash wrapper or not.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   But everything we do is H.264.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.800]   And in fact, when we release downloads,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.720]   I think it's all H.264.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.080]   Right.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.400]   So that's what 264 is a codec inside the MPEG-4 file format.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.840]   We will get into audio as well.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   But it is proprietary.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.040]   It is patented.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.000]   You have to pay to use it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360]   And depending on what you're doing,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.000]   you have to pay different amounts.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   What they did say was that if you're not
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.360]   charging for video and you're publishing it online,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.680]   they will not charge your royalties ever.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.800]   That's something they did change.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   But they only announced that after Google bought onto
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.680]   and set up WebM.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.920]   So onto was a video codec developer
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.800]   that built this sort of VP range of codecs.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.600]   And so the original flash codec that was widely used
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.080]   by YouTube and others was VP3, was part of the onto staff.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.120]   And the current one, I think, is VP8.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.520]   And they open source VP6.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.760]   And the WebM standard that Google is promoting,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   along with Firefox and Flash, as a web video,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   is based on the technology Google bought from--
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.160]   basically Google acquired onto and open source
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.840]   the full codec stack.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.160]   So this is all come down to HTML5 and the search
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.640]   for an open, unencumbered standard for HTML5.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.040]   Is that what's going on?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.240]   That's part of what's going on.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.400]   The other contender in this was Ziff,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.560]   the org who had the open source audio video codecs, which
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.640]   is Vorbis, audio, and Theora video.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.320]   And they've been around a long time.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.920]   And that's also the Ogg file format.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.040]   They've set their own file format as well.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.120]   And their goal was to provide something
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.840]   that was patent and royalty free and open source
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.960]   and available to anyone.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.640]   And it has got a fair bit of pickup
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.920]   within those communities.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.120]   It's the standard codec used for Wikipedia.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.520]   A lot of game people use it.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   And there's some traction there.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.720]   Although there have been assertions consistently
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.480]   that nothing is unencumbered, including that,
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.880]   that there are bits of other people's code in there.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.560]   And it really isn't patent-free.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.680]   Well, this is Apple's position.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.320]   So when I was at Apple, I tried really hard
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.200]   to get them to ship Vorbis inside QuickTime.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.600]   Because Vorbis is a nice codec.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.360]   It works well.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.800]   Good for you.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   And it's open source.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.520]   That's an audio codec, though.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:12.960]   That's not a video.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.480]   Yes, that's the audio codec.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.960]   Theora is the video version.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.520]   Theora is their video codec, which came a bit later.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.080]   And the pushback I got was even though they say it's
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.120]   an encumber, they're not worth suing.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.640]   So as soon as we Apple with our billions of dollars
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.560]   ship it, someone will turn up with a lawsuit and probably Dolby.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.880]   Or someone like that, or Fraunhofer Lamsev,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.480]   the MP3 patents, they'll turn up and injunct us.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.720]   And if they do that, they could deny us
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.240]   the right to playback DVDs.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.800]   They could cause-- or MP3s, or causes all kinds of grief.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.040]   So hence the--
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.400]   So the VP at Apple said to me, we can't do this
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160]   because these patents may come here.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.920]   It's not worth us taking this stand and potentially being
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.040]   held black metal like that.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.680]   It's in fact better to ship a patented product
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   that you know the licensee is and pay the license fee.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.240]   So that's Apple's position.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.760]   So you try to find an open one because of the risk
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.920]   of getting sued.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.080]   That was their contention.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.640]   And you can argue that.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.680]   But that's their position.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.920]   It's still their position.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.960]   If you follow what Apple speaks, people have been saying
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.120]   about this.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.240]   Their position is still-- we want to do this thing
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.920]   where the IP is clear.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.360]   Now Google's position is we should do an open source one.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.440]   And so they said, OK, we're going to ship this open source
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.520]   because we already have a video codec staff.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.360]   Go ahead and sue us.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.880]   They don't actually say go ahead and sue us.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.200]   But they're basically saying we are taking the assertion
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.360]   that stuff doesn't have a patent.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.720]   Isn't the patent encumbered?
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.320]   And guess what?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   We're big enough to sue.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   So if you want to start a lawsuit over this,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   Google would be the person that sued.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.280]   If you're Dolby Labs or Fraunhofer or Toshiba
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.720]   or anything like that.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   So that was somewhat altruistic.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.920]   I mean, Google almost was basically
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.200]   trying to cut the Gordian knot.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.600]   Yes.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   And a lot of this is who has market power?
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.720]   What can they do with it?
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.280]   So YouTube had market power.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.760]   Two or three years ago, everyone wanted YouTube integration.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.640]   And YouTube was using Flash for everything.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.200]   And the path Google took at the time
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.920]   and when they were still friends with Apple
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.400]   was to use 264 and to work with Apple
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.040]   to make the 264 stuff work.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.160]   So Apple didn't have to ship the Flash codec
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.840]   and license that from Adobe and so on.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.200]   So that was there sort of stepped towards openness.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.600]   And it meant that YouTube now uses 264 generally.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.200]   In a Flash wrapper in some cases.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.960]   In a Flash wrapper or not, you've got the choice now.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.240]   But that was the other lever that happened there
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   was that Flash adopted 264 as well.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.800]   Because before that Flash had a--
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   We were using VP6 before.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.840]   So I want to just clarify a little bit.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.960]   Because people are going, well, there's a wrapper,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.840]   which is Flash or QuickTime.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.960]   And then there's a codec, which is what's actually
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.880]   inside the wrapper.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.600]   And these wrappers like Flash can use different codecs.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   So codec stands for codec decoder.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.600]   It's basically the piece of code that takes pixels
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   and turns them into a small compressed bits and back again.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.680]   And they all work basically in similar ways.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.880]   They divide the picture up into squares.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.360]   They frequency encode it.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.520]   And they say, did this one move from here to here
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.880]   to here?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.280]   And actually, the whole generation
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.320]   pretty much two-dimensional.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.200]   So if you start rotating the camera or moving the camera,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.760]   then they have to work really hard.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.520]   Because their mental model of the space
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.160]   is something like the shot we've got here.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.880]   There's a static thing behind that's not moving.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.920]   There's a piece that's moving.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.760]   And that's what they're really tuned for.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.920]   So this generation of video codecs
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.960]   are all broadly similar.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.880]   And the difference is in how big the squares are,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.360]   how variable they are, how much interpolation
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.720]   do they do and do they look at frames in the future
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.640]   as well as frames in the past doing codec.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.720]   So there's a--
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   There's a lot of battle going on between who's better.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   And a lot of people complain.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.480]   Of course.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.760]   And then there always will be.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.200]   So that's--
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.800]   But in your opinion, if anybody knows this, you do.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm sure you've looked at them all.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.160]   And you have the technical expertise to judge.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   Is WebM as good as H.264?
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.840]   I haven't reviewed them recently.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.280]   I mean, the difficulty with this
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   is it's really hard to do this without doing
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.760]   subjective testing.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.960]   Encoding it and looking at it and saying--
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.080]   Encoding it looks better.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.400]   Because if you can measure anything,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.240]   then that gets incorporated into the codec.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.720]   So you can do signal to noise stuff and things like that.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.400]   But that means the machine can detect that
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.640]   and then you tune for that.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.000]   But the subtlety is, does this work better
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.920]   with different dynamic ranges?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.040]   Does it look funny on certain kinds of shots?
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.840]   Does the way interpolates pixel feel wrong?
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.920]   You sometimes get that crawling weirdness in the background.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.280]   And some of that can be tuned by--
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.760]   and that can be independent of the bitstream as well.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.920]   You can define a bitstream for how this works.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.880]   And then you can compete with encoders
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.880]   that do a better job of creating a good bitstream
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.760]   for a given bitstream.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.440]   In other words, it's devishly hard to say
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.560]   one's better than the other.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.600]   It's very hard to evaluate.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.520]   And I think they're all pretty good.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.840]   I mean, if--
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   I like H.264.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.720]   I have a strong preference for it because it scales well.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   It works well at low bit rates and works really great.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   It works well at rates.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.000]   And that's important to us because we're a streamer.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.760]   Well, I'm just thinking--
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.520]   Go ahead.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.640]   No, you go--
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.080]   Go ahead, Jeff, because I want to make sure--
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.560]   I want to ask one political question
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.680]   and one practical question.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   Political question, is this an anti-apple move?
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.000]   It does seem like that.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.760]   I don't think it's directly an anti-apple move.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's more a--
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.600]   it's sending the openness in their viewpoint.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.240]   That their viewpoint is we should move to open source code X.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.160]   We shouldn't have to be relying on this pattern pool.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.920]   And therefore, over time, we should move to this.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   So they're going to drop the flash at some point, too, right?
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.200]   My sense is my suspicion is they're
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.600]   trying to use the market power of YouTube to drive it--
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.280]   Are they going to re-encode every video and web it?
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.080]   That's a nice question.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.160]   And then those--
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.560]   Leo, do you have to re-encode your entire stock?
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   No, they do it for you.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   If you put it on YouTube, they encode it all--
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   they've already done this once, right?
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   They already encode to four different sizes and two code X.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   We just upload a mezzanine file and they encode.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   And if they're going to change it, they have to re-encode.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.160]   Right, but Leo, on Chrome, if I want to watch you directly
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.760]   from some other service, I want to watch your archive,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.560]   you find other means.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   Everything you have is for--
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   Some of the practical--
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   No, some of the practical--
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   From a practical point of view, Kevin,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   can't we just install an H.264 codec on top of Chrome
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.760]   and then be able to do it anyway?
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.960]   You're the flash wrapper.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.560]   Yeah, what this day factor means is that flash is secured
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   on a desktop because--
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   Oh, hold on, hold on.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   If you want to play two-six--
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   Flash, what Apple's screaming about is not open.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   We now depend upon Flash.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   This is the issue.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   Not open.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   This is the issue.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   You're the not open H.264.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   I'm not getting something here.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   I mean, this is what developers are upset about, right?
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   Because Chrome dropping H.264 support means that the HTML5
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   video tag will not render those types of videos.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   It doesn't mean that the flash wrapper won't play those videos.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   The flash wrappers will play those videos.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.560]   So they're claiming that they're pushing the openness of the web
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   farther and kind of--
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   I mean, I think the view there at Google, I imagine,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   is short-term pain for long-term benefit.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   But the thing that developers are--
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   The pain is over--
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   The pain is over--
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   I mean, it is.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   It's just there for publishers.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   But I think the thing that developers are worried about is
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   that this is pushing the whole point of HTML5 video tags is that
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   you don't have to use the freaking flash plugin, right?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   But this is going to-- people are going to say,
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   "I've got a whole library of H.264 video.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   I'm not going to back-end code."
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   So I'm just going to serve Flash.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.560]   So I think the concern is that this move is actually going to push
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   people back to that mode where we're using Flash for video now
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   all the time, which is the exact opposite effect of what we wanted
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   with HTML5.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   Right.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   So yeah, my take on this is that the browsers should
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   obey Post-L's law, which is delivering what you accept
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   and can serve what you output.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   And they should--
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.560]   If you're building a browser, you should play the maximum
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.560]   number of things possible.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   So to explicitly say, we're dropping support for that
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   is a strongly political move, especially when you've already
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   shipped it.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   Evilometer to 10.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   OK, so we were--
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560]   You can argue whether it's evil or not.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560]   We're going to make it evil, Amher.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   This 13 evil--
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   I'm not in video patterns.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   OK, so from a practical point of view--
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   So this is long-term view, I think.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   He's the other way of looking at it.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   The other thing that--
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.560]   She Peter Hoddly just said to me on Twitter is that the other half
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   of this is if you have to license codecs for partners,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   for devices, they all have to currently have to pay the
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   MPEG-LA licensing for 264.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.560]   So this should potentially make devices cheaper in the future,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.560]   because they won't have to pay that.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   Right, it eliminates the license fee.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   And Google, I guess, is indemnifying people on WebM,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   because that seems like--
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   They're not--
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   Well, they're not indemnifying.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   Now, that would be--
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   They're saying we'll take the first hit.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   They're saying, do you want to sue anyone, sue us?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   But, you know, that's something--
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   You can sue anybody.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   And Google's not promising anything.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.560]   Right.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.560]   I mean, you know, also--
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   So I'm looking at, for instance--
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   So I'm looking at, for instance--
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   And our streaming partners, Ustream bitgravity.justin.tv,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   they all ship Flash with H.264.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   If they--
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   Right.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   You know, maybe they could--
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   You could make a compelling case to them,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   oh, use WebM, but we won't indemnify you if you get sued.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   Right.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   So-- But, you know, Flash has said they'll adopt WebM.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   So we're now in this situation, is it you--
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   Oh, this is going to promote Flash.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   So if you're using Chrome or Firefox, you'll need Flash to play 264.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   If you're using Safari or IE, you'll need Flash to play WebM.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   So Adobe, by being the general--
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   Adobe wins!
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   --supporting both Adobe wins.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   And the issue then we then have is that the portable devices,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.560]   which is the future battle, and currently they all play 264,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   because they've paid the licenses and Google's shipped it and so on.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   Google will ship WebM on those, and then Apple will be in the do-we-ship
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   this or not state, and in the same place that they are at the moment
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.560]   with WebM on the desktop.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   And their take may well be-- they don't want to do that.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   So they're going to continue to--
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   Presumably they're going to continue to--
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   They need to continue to support Flash,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   have the embedded Flash player that they currently ship with Chrome in there,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   which seems completely antithetical to what they're saying.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   I mean, that's talk about proprietary.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   Right?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   Are they going to take Flash out?
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.560]   In that case, you know, this is sort of different levels of market power again.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.560]   So Apple, by shipping little portable devices that everyone wants,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   can say, OK, we don't want to ship Adobe Code and our device,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   we don't trust it, so we're not going to do that.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   And therefore, if you want to work on our device,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   you have to drop the Flash stuff, but 264 will still work.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   And Google has got the-- the other thing is, like,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   if we want to compete with it as a desktop browser,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   we need to have Flash there, frankly.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   You can't throw that out yet, you know,
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   even though Apple started doing it with the air.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   Have you held out on the air or have you installed Flash?
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   I installed Flash.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   I'm not going to hold out.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   Nobody's going to hold out.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   I'm not that pure.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   I need Flash.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   Right.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   Is it trading this for me?
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   Is it trading this for me?
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   Squeeze on the iPad, then?
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   No, it's good for the iPad.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   We're not really on Flash.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   And its lack of Flash is all the more determined.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   Is that what it's called?
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.560]   Potentially, you know, it may be a power play in that direction as well.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   Because Android supports Flash.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   Android supports Flash, though.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   You have it on, like, click to play.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   Not well.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   But it's not okay.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   I've got it on the Droid II and it looks okay.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   You know, everybody's going to have Tegra II, which in Flash plays great on that.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.560]   The other half of Flash, you know, the reason that half of Flash is that
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.560]   March of Flash on the web is actually used for extraneous advertising type content.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   And so the reason, you know, that's the reason that it creates such battery load on the iPhone.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.560]   Right.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   Your Flash videos all the time.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   Because you've got little Flash videos playing all around the stream while you're trying to
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   read something else.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   So Apple's basically saying, you know, get rid of that.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.560]   You know, if you want to watch video, watch video, but don't do that.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.560]   So there is a tension in that space of, are we going to, you know, are we going to propagate
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.560]   that?
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   Are the people who've planned on businesses on having video advertising going to be able
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.560]   to carry that on?
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   On the other hand, as a general web user, if you sit there and look at top or, you know,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   the monitor, the flash bits of your browsers are way up there most of the time.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   It's certainly my first candidate for somebody to kill them when I'm, you know, my Ramsfall.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   So there is a tension there that's going to continue.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   And the sort of, the shame for me is that there's been this sort of battle going on inside
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   the HTML5 standard as what should be the one true codec.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   HTML5 needs to stay agnostic on this and let you support whichever one you want.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   But as a browser vendor, supporting more is always better, in my opinion.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.560]   Because, you know, we've got, you know, HTML5 is, you know, is for life.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   It's not just for this current codec battle.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   I mean, you need to be sure that it will support multiple video formats.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.560]   And the other half of this is archival stuff.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   You want to get, you want to have access to the older 264 staff.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   But actually, if you're archiving video and audio, you eventually want to use something
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   that's, that's higher quality.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.560]   And I had a chat with Karl Mullen with about this.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   Who's, you know, Karl, he's been, I mean, government documents and stuff like that.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   And he's concerned about stuff actually, you know, staying around over time.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   And what you do there is you archive uncompressed audio and potentially uncompressed video.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   That's, that's not that practical at the moment.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   But I'm assuming you archival, your show shows as uncompressed audio and not as compressed audio.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   Right.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   Because that's the sense of what you're doing.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.560]   It's only like five or ten times as big.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   Most of the browsers, you know, the browsers won't necessarily play that at the moment.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   They're all focused on, on different bits and pieces.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   So we've got some, some work to do to get this, this stuff to perform better in the browsers
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   and be more compatible.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   But, you know, I think this is a step in the wrong direction in saying, oh, we'll play less stuff.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   I, I think, you know, my idea will be all of them supporting all the formats.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   You know, I, I, I think, Apple supporting WebM and 264 will be sensible,
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.560]   Google supporting tools from web M sensible too.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   And this kind of, you know, turf or doesn't, doesn't help us in the long run.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   But also we should be thinking about, can these, you know, can the, the modern browsers play back the, the.au files, the web files, the RFF files, the audio files at the moment?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   No, no, particularly.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   No.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   And there's also some other stuff.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   Playback wave files often.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Right.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   Some of them do this on the phone.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   I mean, Safari is pretty good at this because it's got quick time in so it plays anything quick time can.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   But most of the others are like, we sort of half play this.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   Right.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   So that's, you know, I think there should be, you know, that may, that should be, maybe I should go and,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   maybe I should go and shout out the standards groups and set up a test page for here's 16 kinds of files you should be able to play.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   Let me, let me, John, John Gruber asks five questions on his daring fireball blog.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   We've answered one.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   Did you see that?
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Android currently supports H.264.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   He says, will you be, will you be Google?
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   Will you be removing it from Android too?
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   I guess presumably, right?
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   I think potentially they will be in, in every time.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   I think that'll be harder for them.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   Right.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   I can, I could see them doing that.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   Again, the question is, is how much it costs to, how much you have to license to both the device, right?
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.560]   Right.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   Right.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   So if you want to make a cheaper device, you want to produce the number of things you have to pay for to put in it.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   And at the moment you'll have to, if you want to capture 264, you have to pay to, to the license for that.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   So, yeah, that, that, that, that's, that's one strand of this.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   Do you think Google was aware of the unintended consequence of promoting flash from this move?
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   Or is it, it sounds like this is a very common kind of open source purist type move without really considering consequence?
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   This is basically doing what, doing what, um, Mozilla is doing.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.560]   You know, they're basically, Google is now in line with Mozilla.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   That's right.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   Mozilla said, I'll write it right from the front.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   No H.264.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.560]   Bobo, you should flash.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   Um, so.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   Again, so you, you, you can install flash, you can install a plugin of some kind that will let you play H.264.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   That's not the issue.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   It's what happens when a browser hits bracket video bracket.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   It's what.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   Exactly.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   What happens then?
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   Right.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   And the challenge, you know, the challenge there is if you, you know, if I'm building video stuff in the future and audio stuff in the future, I want to be doing using that.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   That seems like a great way to do it for me.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   But we've just been condemned to make sure we have the right, um, either encode everything twice or potentially more or write a whole bunch of hairy fallback code to do flash.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   Well, and the other thing is, if I'm using the, sorry, it's a subtle to hear, you cannot declaratively do a fallback onto flash.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   Um, the way that the video and audio tanks work is, um, if you save video format, nickel or something and the browser can't play that, it doesn't fall back to the stuff inside.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   Um, it does.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   Um, it just gives you a controller that's just a play.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:24.560]   Um, so the only way you can get the right behavior is to write JavaScript that sits there and mungies around and tries to do the right thing and swaps in a flash one.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.560]   Oh, here's the problem.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   I guess there's the flash.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   You can do the other way around.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   You can make a flash thing and say if you haven't got flash, put the video in and the video will play and that works declaratively without having to write JavaScript at all.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   So what that means is the asymmetry is that it'll be actually easy to embed the flash and have the fallback for the non flash case, which is the wrong way around in my, in my head for as a, you know, as a stepping forward.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   Here's my question, but in a Chrome OS world where I'm going to be editing video raw materials, not just a question about consuming material.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   It's also about being able to render things in my browser and the browser is the OS.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   Then have they limited the radically things like like authoring a video.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   Historically, it's very hard to edit MPEG video.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.560]   Yeah, no, I mean, this is, you know, this is the sort of Apple was great.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.560]   Squared opportunity was quick time was the thing that had that.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]   Right.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   You know, it is editable.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   It is editable reference.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   It's very quick and very powerful.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   And that was the bit that they decided to charge for and, you know, therefore lost the edge.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   Almost everybody transcodes before they edit, right?
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.560]   I mean, nobody edits in native MPEG.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.560]   It's too hard.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   It's frame based.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.560]   It's very difficult to get accurate.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   Well, you can do it.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   Quick time can do it.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.560]   Quick time can do frame accurate edits on bidirection encoded stuff.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.560]   But yeah, you don't need to re-encod on the on the on the live movie.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   I movie transforms it into a.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   Transcode.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   It transcodes it.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   The original I movie was always in DV.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   The modern one is in.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   Oh, yes, or something.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   It was I'm not sure which it was.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   It was picked for a while.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   I haven't actually looked at what it translates into.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   But it's easier to edit frame accurate form.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.560]   Well, it's designed to be an all key frame thing so you can edit quickly.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   Right.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.560]   Oh, that's right.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   So I think it does use progress.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   Do you explain key frames and different frames?
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   No.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   You're going to get it.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   I mean, that's a that's would be a great thing to do for another show.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   I would love to kind of in fact, you're the guy to do it.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Have a a primer in video and codecs and all of this stuff because it's a fascinating subject.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   But I think we're more interested in the politics of this than the the technology.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   Gina, what's your what's your reaction on this?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.560]   I'm really sad about the possibility of excuse me.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   Sorry.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   Sorry.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   I'm really I'm really sad about the possibility of the backlash.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   I think that Google the backlash being that we roll back to flash.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   Sure looks like an anti apple move.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   I mean, this is exactly like counter to what Apple has been saying.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   It does.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   This feels like a business decision.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   This doesn't feel like we're serving our users decision in the short term.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   I mean, a lot of people are saying, hey, this is going to be short term pain for long term gain.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.560]   And I can see that.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   But I just hope it doesn't set back HTML5 and it feels very much like a business decision
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.560]   and not a decision based on what users want.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.560]   And I just wish that Chrome had shipped this way.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.560]   Like when you build software, you don't have a feature and then pull it.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.560]   Right.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   You know, I don't like the idea that they dropped it.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   Yeah, Mozilla, we don't we aren't complaining about this with Mozilla.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   Chris, they're not as they don't have the market.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.560]   Hang on.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   I've complained about them as well.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.560]   I mean, the reality is that Google is trying to shape it.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.560]   They will pay the license fee.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   It's not reasonable for Mozilla, which is a charity to pay 10% of their annual income to
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   MP LA to ship the codec.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   So I can hear you.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   It makes more sense for them not to do it.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   Right.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   It doesn't feel like a matter of resources or money for Google.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   It definitely feels like like a political move.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   And I see, you know, Google is obviously trying to shape the future of the web.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   This isn't, I mean, people spend a lot of time trying to make their site, you know, easily
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   findable by the Google bot.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   This isn't the first time that people are going to have to change their content in order
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.560]   to work well with Google technology.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.960]   You know, for users, this is going to be a pain in the ass, but all you have to do is switch
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   to another browser.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.560]   I don't know if people will do that.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.560]   I think it's interesting they waited until they have kind of the market share that they
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   have to make the decision.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   Yeah, that's why they didn't do it.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.560]   That's a really good point.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.760]   I mean, they could have done it on launch instead.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.720]   They waited till they had market share and then said, ah, pull the rug right out from
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   under.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.280]   Well, I mean, I'm not sure WebM was ready.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.120]   You know, they're not going to ship a technology that doesn't work very well.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.120]   Is WebM ready now?
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.920]   WebM is pretty good now.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.720]   So they're going to re-encode every video on YouTube and WebM and they're going to drop
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.160]   flash and they're going to.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.760]   And 200 years from now, it'll all be done.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.520]   At some point, they'll drop it.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   But my suspicion is that the, you know, Peter Hody's licensing point is a good one.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:04.640]   If you're going to make a cheap Chrome OS device, you don't want licensing audio video
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   codecs to be a chunk of that price.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   So this might be more for the Chrome.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.240]   So the goal of the goal of the Android and Chrome is to make the licensing stuff negligible
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.360]   so that you don't have that extra burden on those things.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.880]   So that, that, you know, I can see that as part of the agenda.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.280]   And the longer term thing of moving off this patented technology onto technology makes
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   sense.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.160]   But I'm surprised they're doing it this early.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.800]   And I think, you know, and I still think dropping support is, is unhelpful.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.320]   And yeah, supporting legacy stuff is hard.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.440]   You know, one of the, one of the things that the QuickTime era that I was there was we
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.920]   will support every movie ever made in QuickTime and make sure it still plays back.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.520]   And that, that was quite a commitment that Apple held up from sort of 1990 through to
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.480]   you know, 2004 or so.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:59.040]   And then the recent version of QuickTime, the QuickTime X has shipped without support for
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   all of the older formats.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.760]   And you have to use the older player to, to place some of that back.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.800]   So they finally made a break without on that their side as well.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:13.040]   But I still think that certainly for these archival formats for stuff that has a large
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.760]   deployed base of video out there, unless you're going to, you know, submit to, you know, commit
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.600]   to transcoding, not just the stuff that you host, but the rest of the rest of the web
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.880]   as well service, which is potentially, I can imagine that someone in Google thinking about
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.520]   that and going, oh, we could call the video on the web and re-encoded.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.920]   But that's a very good thing to do.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   I mean, I'll do it for you.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.320]   I'll just read computers at this.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.040]   But the, you know, unless you're going to do that, you're starting to lose stuff.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.800]   And we've got enough problems with losing old material already without, without, you
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.280]   know, deliberately doing it.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.920]   That's, that's, that's my sense of that.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.480]   And meanwhile, Larry Page buys a $54 million super yet.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   I'm not cynical.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.720]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   We're going to talk more.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   Kevin Marks is here.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   I'm going to talk more about the video.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   I want to talk about this.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   I'm so glad you did because I can't think of anybody
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   better equipped to explain this.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   I'm going to assume it's coming from a desire to promote open
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   standards.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   I think there may be some bumps along the way.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   Let's hope that Google puts its considerable weight behind
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   the notion of an open web standard for HTML5.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   I mean, web M's fine with me, but we've got to do something
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   about the flash issue.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   Yeah, I think it comes from a good place.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   I think Google is trying to guide the future of the web,
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   the path the web is taking.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   I'm just a little bummed.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   I am a big believer in Postel's law, like Mike McEvans said.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   But that's not always compatible with open.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   I know, I know.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   But when open is limiting, that's when open affects users
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   and web publishers and the way that this may affect people.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   I mean, hey, you know, this is people just have to switch
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   browsers.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   I mean, they may, if they lose users, then they will.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   I mean, like you said, Adobe may be the short term winner.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   I think in the long term, this is a good thing.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   It's just right now it felt like, oh, it felt like a political
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   strategic business move, not a move that serves users.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   Luke Johnson, well-known British entrepreneur, former head
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.720]   of channel four in Britain disagrees.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   He says Google is arrogant.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   He accused them of acting unethically by avoiding tax.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   We talked about that the Dutch sandwich and what was it?
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   The Irish.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   Irish go between.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   Whatever they're using.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   If I were big enough, I would use it.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   When are we going to get in our Irish branch?
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Look at that.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   I have to wait.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   You could funnel all the money to Ireland.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   Do the accent, Leo.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   I'll bet you can.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   Oh, and I like it too.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.720]   Faith in Bagara.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   Welcome to Twitt, Ireland.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   They also, he says, by dominating web advertising, Google
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   siphons off revenue that once supported quality content
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   and television newspapers, well, that's the old media talking.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   He's recycling every possible old anti-Google argument you
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   can imagine.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   He might as well be German.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   It's Merdachian.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   Yes.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   That's a new word.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   It's Merdachian.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   By the way, rumor is that Rupert Merdach and Steve Jobs
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   will take the stage in a week at the San Francisco Museum of
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   Modern Art to announce the daily.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   As a wag set, it goes straight to the museum.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   Good place to do it.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   Good place to do it.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   We're going to go to a museum and talk about the future of
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   newspapers.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   Not.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   [laughter]
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   According to--
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   Well, we're at Google criticism now.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   Now the Germans, my favorite country of the Germans,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   are going after Google.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   They've cut off negotiations with Google and turn--
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   well, about privacy and such.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   I'm not sure what the negotiations were aimed for.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   But their big argument is that Google Analytics tracks your IP
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720]   address.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   [sighs]
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   How could they?
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.720]   Did Ted Stevens come back to life and take over the
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   Bundestock?
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   I track your freaking IP address.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   Yeah, everybody tracks your freaking IP address.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   [laughter]
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   And now they're going after this ridiculous thing where you
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   have to be able to anonymize your IP address.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   Well, your IP address essentially is anonymous.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   And then some talk about how you can make a partial IP address
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   or some such a factor thing like that.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   It's absurd.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   Meanwhile, the German government were the one who wanted Google
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   to hold on to date a longer so that they could track you.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   Well, there is-- I mean, there is sort of--
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   Google really does IP address degradation, right?
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   They have-- they did a long thing about this a while back.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   When they said they hold it for so long and after a while,
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.720]   they, you know, they randomize the logistics and stuff.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   They want to stay up to the start, Kevin, which makes no sense.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   So all they're going to do is, you know, they'll go by your
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   cookie number and got your IP address, but it makes no sense.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   It's not a partial--
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   If this would track you better, yeah.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   Right.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   It's absurd and sane and just plain stupid.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   I love you, Germans, but--
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   Well, how about this?
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   The South Korea Cyber Terror Response Center in August, as you may know,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   seized hard drives from Google's sole office.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   And they said, "We unlocked 79 computer disk seized from Google
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   last summer and discovered emails, instant messages,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   and other private data set over Wi-Fi networks."
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   It's the old Street View thing.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   I love this-- the headline from, uh, from Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   Well, hell, if all I knew-- if I knew all I had to do was
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   seize the hard drives, it's not a quote, but they said that might
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   be what Attorney General, Connect Attorney General,
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   Richard Blumenthal, who's suing Google might have said,
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   "I should have gotten the hard drives.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   I wouldn't make it easy."
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   So-- but it's fragmentary data, right?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   Of course, the same thing.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   This is just an effort to be anti-Google, and Google doesn't do
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   everything right, and Google's not perfect, and all that's true.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   But this is kind of anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, anti-American.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   I hate to sound like an conspiracy theorist, but--
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   [sighs]
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   Speaking of privacy, you know, I should have bookmarked this.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   This is one of my favorite stories over the holidays.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   You know, Google was sponsoring free Wi-Fi on airplanes,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   and there was a tech reporter sitting behind a Google employee
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   on a plane, and the Google employee was connected to the free
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   Google Wi-Fi and was reading, you know, confidential company
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   email, and the seat-- it was-- he actually wasn't directly
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   behind him.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   He was in the seat diagonal, and the person right in front of him
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   had put her seat back.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   So he had, like, a clear view of this Google employee's screen.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   And he actually-- he said, gosh, I have to hunt down this link,
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   and then we'll put it in the show notes.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   He contacted Google PR and said, do you have a policy about laptop
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   screens being, you know, visible in public places?
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.720]   And I guess they said they didn't, or they didn't get back.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   I'm not sure, but I was like, oh, OK.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   I'm just in the store.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   He said he could see the big words, "confidential," about, like,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   the employee bonus over the-- [laughs]
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   [laughs]
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   [laughs]
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   Oh, man.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   So Winona-- so Winona Ryder shares our fear of Google IC.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   Yeah, she does.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   [laughs]
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   You got to queue that up after the ad, but it's--
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   I'm playing the ad right now.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   I'm going to skip the ad.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.720]   This is from New York Magazine.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   And the one that comes after that is very good, too.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   This is Winona on what, late night with David Letterman?
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   No, I think we'll see.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   We'll see.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.720]   OK.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   Maybe one.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   Unfortunately, the ad is very long.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   [laughs]
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   There we go.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   Here we go.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   This is Winona Ryder on some show.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   Late night on late night.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   You know, it's the whole thing of the Googling, which is very
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   terrifying to me because--
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   The Googling.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   It scares me to the Googling.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   I'm here that I'm going to be trying to find out, you know, what
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   movie is playing at what theater, and then I'm going to
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   suddenly be a member of Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   [laughs]
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   Oh, it's Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   Thank you.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   Jimmy Fallon, one of that, Jimmy's.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   The Jimmy's.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   It's Jimmy's.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   You know, I confuse those two.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   I confuse them.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   We're at a button already from joining Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   That's what that's going to be.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   That's not going to happen to you.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   We know that--
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   Please, pass the wrong button.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   Matt, looking for a movie, are going to come out.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   I kind of remember.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   Hey, you think--
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   Who is what could happen?
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   All right.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   Well, then stay away from me.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   I wanted to be Townsend.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   And we know that, you know, you can't.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   Yes.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.600]   I mean, I'm not going to be a
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   person.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   I'm not going to be a person.

[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   I'm not going to be a person.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   Don Glover.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.600]   Don Glover looks like Don Glover.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   That's a bad name.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   Stick with it.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   Stick with it.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   Stick with it.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   Yes, it does.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Yes, it does.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   Not sure people don't know.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   I was getting like, oh.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   So I get a lot of strange tweets.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   A lot of people are like, oh, hey, I would
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   tweet something like, hey, I'm going to
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   eat a chipotle and they'd be like, yeah, I bet
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.

[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   I'm going to eat a chipotle.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   I own HNI stock, thoughts on it are my opinion, talk to a financial advisor.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   But the stock went up Monday, 290%.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   This company was 10 cents a share and went up to $0.39.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   Boosting his $0.30 million share stake too, if my math is correct, $8.7 million from
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.600]   3 to 8.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   He made $5.7 million from a tweet.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   Fitties got some serious social media engagement.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   I think Fitties got to have a knock on this bottle.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   Fitties got to get a knock on the door from the feds.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   That's what Fitties got to get.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   When I saw this headline, I was sure that it was going to be some advertiser paying him
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.600]   to tweet about something, and it was not that.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   I love getting financial advice from rappers.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.600]   I thought it was very...it was sleek audio we were talking to.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   Those headphones, those Sonomax headphones or something like that, they were the ones
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   that we actually met him at CES.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   He said, "Oh, yeah, he's very involved.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   He's a big investor, and he gives us a lot of ideas.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   He listens.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   He pays attention.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   We talked to him every day."
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   So maybe he was just...
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   Chart's hilarious.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   I just looked it up on Bloomberg.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   It's gone back down.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   It's gone back down some, but it's still...but what's funny is the volume.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   10 million shares.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Now remember Fittie made $100 million on bottled water?
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.600]   This guy's sharp, I guess.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   Fittie, by the way, is a big fan of H.264, and I think that he...
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   What about CES?
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   Let's talk about CES.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   I thought we were going to see more Android tablets.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   We didn't really see Honeycomb.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   We saw a video.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   The same video we showed last week.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   And I was a little disappointed because CNET named that Zoom tablet,
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   the Motorola Zoom tablet, their best-to-show, but all we saw was it playing a video.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   So I couldn't really say that was best-to-show.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.600]   It might be, if it lives up to that.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   Kevin, have you played with Honeycomb?
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   Have you got inside?
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   No.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600]   I haven't played with Honeycomb yet.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   I haven't seen one for it.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   I'll tell you what surprised me and looks good and was my best-to-show was the Blackberry Playbook,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   which until now I had thought was vaporware, but I played with it.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   They purchased QNX and customized it, and that thing sings.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   What does it run?
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   QNX.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   QNX.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   QNX?
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   It's been around a long time.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   Unix-like real-time operating system, RTOS, that is used often for embedded systems.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   It's very stable because it's been around so long.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   And they have made it slick as can be.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   I mean, it is beautiful.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   And what I really like is their multitasking.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   So you can have a full-screen video on YouTube playing.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   Swipe up from the bottom.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   There's no buttons.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Swipe up from the bottom.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   It minimizes to a window in a cover flow kind of display, and all the windows are still live.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   You know how the...
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   Sometimes the dock is live on a Mac.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   All the windows, so the video continues to play.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   You open the next window.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   It's a game.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   You minimize it.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   It continues to go.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   All of this stuff is going in.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   You know, it's a Tegra 2 in there.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.600]   It's a dual gigahertz processor, gigabyte of RAM.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   This is a very powerful system.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   It's a seven-inch...
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   Ten minutes of battery life.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   You know, they didn't say.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   I'm surprised that was your pick of the show.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   I was sure that you were going to come back with some awesome Android device that you love.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.600]   Well, the other one I was very impressed with, also Motorola was the Atrix phone.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   The Atrix.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   Which is again a Tegra 2 platform in a very nice looking phone.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   And it docks.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   It's so powerful.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   It docks in a keyboard and I think was an 11-inch screen.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   And it's a laptop.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   Yeah, that looked really cool.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   That gave me that feeling of like, "Oh, it's like the Jetsons.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   I'm just going to fold up my car and stick it in my back pocket kind of feeling."
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   You know, that was really cool.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   No, I was...
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   I think Motorola is doing some good stuff.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   Now, that's Android-based.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   Not based...
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   So, the Zoom...
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   If the honeycomb is as good as the video looks, I would have to revise my opinion.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   But it's just a video, so we don't know.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   The Atrix is...
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   The next version of Android, Ice Cream or Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   Now, so clarify this for me.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   That's 2.4, right?
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   That's not...
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   I'm confused.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   No, that sounds like honeycomb.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   It's not 3.1, though.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   So, this is what I was worried about because it looked like they might be forking it because
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   Honeycomb is clearly a tablet OS.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   I don't see that necessarily on a phone.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   Do you think they'll fork it?
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   I think it's more that they're making it more general.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   You know, what they've done...
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   I've read a thing about this last week, but if you look at the spec that they say...
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   You have to build the device like this to ship Android X.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   That spec has got looser over time.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   So, what the 1.6 spec said, it must be a phone, it must have a camera, it must do this.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   There was a whole set of musts in there before they would even consider letting you call it 1.6.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   And get therefore getting the App Store and all the Google pieces.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   But as that's moved over time, the must have become maze or shoulds.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   So that you don't have to have telephony after 2.1, and you don't have to have a camera in 2.3 and so on.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   And so, they're sort of relaxing the criteria for what constitutes an Android,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   which means that they're making it support a broader range of devices over time.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   And they've said that Honeycomb will run on older devices too.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   We've got that directly from Android engineers saying,
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   "No, no, we're not going to require two processes, that was a myth."
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   It'll run on the other ones too.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   And Broughts-Patrick did quite a long post on all the work they've done to optimise and improve Android
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   and the monitoring stuff they've got there now.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   So I think the assumption is that they will keep expanding the range of things it runs on.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   So I don't think that the intention is to fork it at all.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   Good, my hope not, because that would be a bad idea.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   So Icecream is, I think, 2.4.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   Well, wait, Honeycomb is 3, right?
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   You said that.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   So Icecream Sandwich should be 3.something, right?
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   It should be, but I don't know if that is.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.600]   The TechCrunch article about Icecream Sandwich, it is a sandwich.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   It's a sandwich, okay.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.600]   Because you can't make a statue out of just Icecream, you need something.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   Well, it doesn't look any different from Frozen Yorker.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   That's the problem.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   Good point.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   Well, more Butterfat, I think, is the key.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   And by the way-
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   That's why my Android, more Butterfat.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   More Butterfat.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   And by the way, Halix in our chatroom tells me that actually Fitti prefers Ogfiora and a Matrochka rapper.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   So we would like to make that clear.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   I think Tim Bray tweeted that after he visited all the Android things and after Honeycomb was insulin.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   Insulin.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   They were like, "I was gonna show them."
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   I'm trying to beat these.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.000]   You know, there were eight million- because Android's open and anybody can use it, there
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.680]   were eight million very cheap Chinese tablets out there that I didn't really bother covering
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.720]   that were all based on Android.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.000]   Really surprisingly large number of them on 2.2.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.080]   Really doesn't look like gingerbread is really- has been ported to many of these devices
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   yet.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   Still waiting for gingerbread.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   They're still waiting for those to- for the code drop.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:55.720]   And, you know, this was the- the- the- the post I read about two faces of Android is that
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.600]   there's this set of ones that aren't bothering with Google's compatibility staff.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.560]   They're just taking the code and porting it and potentially modifying it themselves.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.400]   And that's fanning out into all the consumer electronic devices.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.640]   So we're gonna have all these sort of cheap and weird things that are gonna just happen
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   to be running Android.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.280]   It'll be in cameras and phones.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   Everywhere.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.480]   And, you know, photo frames and MP3 players and whatever.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.560]   Because it's a fairly resilient OS that you can do quite a lot with.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.520]   And if you do a bit of work, you can make some apps support it.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.920]   And then there are others that will- you go the step further into the compatibility staff
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.440]   with the- with the stuff that Google requires.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.520]   And then the step after that is you're actually going to do this dev with Google and get
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.240]   agreements on shipping the store and Gmail and NaV and all the stuff that Google provides
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   as well.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.080]   So there's a sort of- it is spreading out into a lot of space.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.320]   But the- I think Google's assumption is they can keep it coherent by that biz dev piece
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.600]   that's on the- on the top layer of what constitutes a- you know, a fully realized Android with
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Google.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.520]   That'll affect brand, I think, to some extent.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.720]   The one device I saw a release on, you know, it's all- see, it's releases- is no goggles
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.080]   with Android and Google Maps as a result.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.160]   Yeah, actually we're gonna show those unreaches in Kelly on Tuesday.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.160]   You are.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   I'm cool.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   I may not- I'm- I may not mention Android.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   It's got a heads-up display.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:16.000]   The display is six feet in front of you and you see it's got GPS, it's got wind speed,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.560]   altimeter, and all this stuff's on a heads-up display.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.160]   And yes, a Google map as you go down the slopes.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   Right on.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   Cool.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.760]   Yeah, well that's- you know, it's interesting.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:31.840]   I mean, how much of it is that it's free and how much of it that is- I think free is really
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.000]   the key, isn't it?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.720]   Like that definitely helps.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.200]   Free is standard to an extent that if it does develop at some point you can- you can
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   go along to the right.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   And that's just free of encumbrance of contractual encumbrances.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   Not just money, but- Yes.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   Well, even- even- Even Chumpy is-
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.280]   Well, as free as in beer, yeah.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.920]   Even Chumpy is moved to Android.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.840]   I don't know if Chumpy was- Chumpy was a- is a Linux OS in the Chumpy device, but they've
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.840]   made an Android version of the Chumpy.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.640]   Oh, it makes perfect sense.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.120]   You know, it's like, oh, there's a platform here.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   Right.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.960]   We can either write all our own drivers and do everything and then go and evangelize
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:14.360]   developers or we can say, here's a fairly well-designed platform that lets you build
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.800]   apps that will run on this thing.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.520]   And we just have to write a few device drivers and plug into that.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.640]   And that's the sort of effort of software development is so much lower to do that.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   That makes a lot of sense for everyone.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.520]   I think you're soon going to see what you see at Kickstarter, which is a company I love
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.440]   that enables people to get enough money to get started and make something.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   I just bought my third thing from Kickstarter.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   What was it?
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   What was it?
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   What was the curiosity?
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.440]   You want to tell us?
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:47.160]   I bought the little holder from my iPhone so that I can put it into a tripod.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   Oh, neat.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.800]   So this is a company that says we'll manufacture it if we get enough people who say we'll buy
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.800]   it.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   Right.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   Right.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   And you get certain benefits.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.640]   For that device, which is in my bag, if I'll pull it out in the commercial break, if
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:08.320]   you wanted it right away and donated more, they would have turned it off off a 3D printer
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.960]   and you would have gotten it first.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   Oh, cool.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.800]   Yeah, that by the way, that was another.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:20.080]   I was really pleased to see a MakerBot and Brie Pettis at CES, which is just the strangest
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.520]   experience to see a wooden device, a thing maker at CES.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   So great.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.520]   Isn't that great?
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.560]   Brie made me a little box out of a MakerBot.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.640]   I was just absolutely amazed that it's on my desk right over here.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.120]   Like, I just love it.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   So cool.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   I got split strap.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:42.600]   That was the latest one, which is the problem I have with laptop bags and such is that the
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.760]   strap is never good and this one's designed differently and they look into it.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.120]   And so they've got straps for cameras and bags and even a sling.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   And what the heck?
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.160]   This really reinvents how a company can bring a product to market.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   I just love it.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   It does.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   It does.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.200]   We have of adding in things like Android, adding in technology to this.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.360]   And imagine how someone can find out whether there's demand for the product, underwrite
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:12.240]   the cost with no capital needs, use others platforms for the technology, use others platforms
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.040]   for the manufacturing distribution, and reduce the risk to not.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.680]   And I think there's a lot of opportunity here to really get, if I were Google, I'd set
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:32.160]   up some kind of investment fund or contest or something for hardware to use Android in
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.920]   new and cool and creative ways at a place like Kickstarter.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.920]   Interesting.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.120]   You need, well, and this is what Microsoft, the lesson of Microsoft in the 90s was if you
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.000]   have a solid stable platform that people could develop for, it really spurs innovation.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.200]   And maybe that was one of the lessons of CES.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.800]   Microsoft was there, but they said, "We're going to make windows on arm."
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.640]   Intel was there, but they went, "Huh?"
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.440]   I mean, this was, I mean, of course, CES has never been a wind tell show, but boy, you
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.440]   just feel the guard changing.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.200]   You just really feel the guard changing.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.680]   It is not Microsoft and Intel anymore.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.080]   And all the innovation is happening on portable.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.480]   And a lot of it is powered by Android, if not iOS.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   What do you got, Jeff?
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   Is that your?
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   This is the glyph.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   I saw that.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   Right?
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   Very simple little thing.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   And so the camera goes, you know, the watch.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   That was not going to work.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Well, it will kind of work.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   I have my stupid...
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.480]   You have a case on it.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   And 10, that case thing.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   Right?
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.480]   But then it becomes a...
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.480]   Right?
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   And I think this was 20 bucks.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   Wow.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.200]   Quick Kickstarter is like the place for iPod accessories.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.280]   I actually bought the lunatic watch holder for the iPod Nano, which I do not own.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.480]   I'm actually going to buy an iPod Nano just to witness where this was.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   I missed the time, yeah.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.480]   Well, now, but wait a minute.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   Griffin and everybody else is now making iPod Nano watch holders.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.760]   Griffin actually made a slap watch.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   You know about those?
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.200]   There's a smart metal in there.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   So you slap it around your wrist.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.120]   It fits one size fits anybody because you slap it around your wrist and it fits.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.760]   Oh, no, I haven't seen this.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.440]   And does it activate the watch screen when you do that?
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.400]   Well, the screen is the default screen on the Nano.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.840]   So when you press the button, the watch screen pops up.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.080]   I've been wearing my Nano as a watch for some time.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   I just...
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.840]   See, and I'm waiting for Kickstarter.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.200]   So the Kickstarter guy, the manufacturer of my own.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.880]   He raised a million dollars.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   Wow.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   That is impressive.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   It's...
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   It's...
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   It's...
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   It's the first Kickstarter project.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.880]   I think that broke a million.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.280]   The reason I got into covering technology is because it's so...
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.600]   It's changing and ever changing everything so fast is so fun.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   But you still...
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   It's still...
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   There's a certain gradual feeling to it except once in a while and something like
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.880]   Kickstarter and you go, this is going to change everything forever.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   You know, I mean, the world just changed.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   You know, I was on Twitter thinking this through and this is going to weigh a field.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.880]   But that's what I do.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.120]   That's why I specialize in it.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:54.280]   You know, if you look at a company like GM that really had a century, that was it.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.880]   And you wonder whether...
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.120]   And people are debating, you know, will Facebook be forever?
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.120]   Well, probably not.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.720]   Neither Google, you know, what do they have?
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.640]   Maybe most of the generation, maybe 20 years.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.960]   Tech companies have a much shorter cycle, don't they?
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   Exactly.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.720]   You know, how long did Microsoft have at the top?
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   IBM.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   And then, right, or they had to utterly morph themselves into something else.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.640]   IBM became a service company.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.080]   Google's trying to become a mobile company.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.640]   Amazon's becoming a service company.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.960]   Facebook's trying to become the phone company if you believe some people.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.600]   Which is JP's great, great...
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.680]   I think Raghuswami, yeah.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.880]   And so you wonder whether there's this idea of kind of a pop-up company that you go to
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.920]   a different life cycle, like a VC fund, that you raise the money, you make the product,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   and then you kind of exit.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.080]   That's all you need.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   Huh.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.880]   Well, I think there are quite a few people who have actually done that.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   I think so too.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   That's a new way.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.120]   You're not living forever.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.440]   You could be the guy buying the $45 million yacht.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.920]   By the way, Larry Page's $45 million yacht when you look at the pictures.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   It's quite prosaic.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   It's not...
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.640]   I mean, I thought for $45 million you'd get something, you know, like Arab oil chic kind
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   of.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.800]   But no, it just looks like an order.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.720]   Is it sort of known for living fairly normally?
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.120]   It looks like a normal, just like, you know, it's got, you know...
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120]   Normal yacht.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   Normal yacht.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.400]   It's like when you go to Hearst Castle.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.640]   If you've ever gone to Hearst Castle, which of course is the most insane thing ever built,
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.680]   you know, it's a castle in the middle of Southern California.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.400]   And which William Randolph Hearst built with his millions?
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.360]   And you go and you look at the table and this long table that people like Charlie Chaplin
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.240]   and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. aid at, and there's ketchup at every spot.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.560]   There's a bottle of Heinz ketchup.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   It's like that.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.040]   The rich are just like you and me.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.680]   The great Gatsby was wrong.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.160]   We're going to come back with your picks just a little bit.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.680]   Also, I have a little musical interlude, including vuvuzellas.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.280]   No, don't run away.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   It's good.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   But first, I...
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   Really, I promise.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:04.040]   But first the word from squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional website Squarespace
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.240]   is what we use for our inside Twit Blog.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   So many of my friends now are using Squarespace.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.960]   In fact, it was really amazing when Alex Lindsey told me that he loves Squarespace so much
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.760]   and he uses it all the time, that he went to a restaurant the other day.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.560]   They didn't have a website.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.680]   And before he left the restaurant, he had gone to Squarespace, signed up for a free
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.600]   account and created a site for the restaurant and said, "Here it is, guys.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   If you want it, you really ought to have a website."
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.040]   All you have to do, go to squarespace.com/twit.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.120]   Click the green button.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   You don't need anything.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.040]   Just the name of your site, a password, an email address for password recovery and a
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.920]   capture to keep robots out and you'll be designing a site.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.160]   Thing is you don't need to know any HTML or CSS because Squarespace has 50 plus, actually
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.880]   60 plus, great designer styles that you can make your own with drag and drop.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.760]   They use Ajax as such a slick way.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.440]   The software is so cool.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.040]   But this is software plus hosting.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.880]   It's everything you need for your next site.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.200]   You can move your existing site over easily enough because it supports all the major
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.520]   APIs, including movable type word, press type, and blogger.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.680]   By the way, that imports not just the content and pictures, but all the comments, everything,
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.120]   all the links work.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.400]   So literally in 10 minutes, you could set up a new site on squarespace.com with all of
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.280]   the content of your old site.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:29.240]   Then go to the iPhone and iPad for the great Squarespace application that lets you post,
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.160]   manage, delete spam, and see incredible statistics.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.040]   The stats package is so good on squarespace.com.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:43.560]   I want you to try it out absolutely free squarespace.com/twig.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.520]   If you decide to buy and it starts at $12 a month, that's hosting plus the software,
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.280]   automatic updates and all of that, you'll get 10% off when you use the offer code twig,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.720]   not just for the first month or the first year, but for the life of your site.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:05.840]   So it's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.000]   Okay, so they've named the Google Orchestra.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.960]   They do this every year, right?
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.080]   Yeah, YouTube or strike it.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   I'm sorry, YouTube.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.040]   YouTube or orchestra.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   What is the deal?
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.160]   People submit their auditions and now they've selected 101 people from 30 countries to go
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   to the Sydney Opera House to perform in March as the YouTube Symphony Orchestra.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   Talk about a big build-up.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160]   Gee.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   I'm a fan of this bomb in Shellist.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:47.400]   I've been selected to perform with the YouTube Symphony Orchestra here at the Sydney Opera
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   House in the U.S.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400]   Of course they use the Australian guys, cheaper.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.400]   Oh, about Sydney?
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.400]   The YouTube Orchestra?
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   I already posted my video online.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   Didn't you see it?
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   You don't want to fast forward to the booth, is it like that?
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.400]   That's how it all started.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   Is he later on in here?
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.600]   He's about a quarter of the way through.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   There he is.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.320]   Oh, no, no, next he comes back.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   He comes back.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   There we go.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   Guess what?
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.320]   He's going to play Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   Ready?
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.320]   My name is--
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:19.360]   You know, I would absolutely put him in.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.320]   That's kind of neat.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   I'm glad they do that.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:31.080]   It's really a neat idea for, you know, kind of acknowledging musicians.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.480]   YouTube's also started a TV show with our friend Shira Lazar that highlights the big
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.920]   producers, directors on YouTube.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   And they made a very good point.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:45.680]   You know, Angry Orange, you don't hear about them on TV, but they have audiences every
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.840]   bit as big as the network.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.440]   And you know, if unless you're in a YouTube fanatic, you may not know about them.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   So I think that's kind of neat.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.960]   So Shira's got a show where she highlights those people.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.800]   I think good for her.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   Do we want to play?
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800]   Yeah, please.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.560]   The WikiLeaks story, Jacob back on Applebaum, otherwise known on Twitter as IO error.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.160]   He was staying out of the country for a while because he was on the secret summons that
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.760]   Twitter then revealed.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.560]   And we think of that because by the way, I have subpoenaed Twitter because we received
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.200]   a death threat and I went to the police and had him subpoenaed.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.760]   And I have to tell you, I don't know if it's such a good idea that Twitter would tell the
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   guy who issued a death threat.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   Oh, by the way, we revealed your identity to Leo.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.120]   It just might speed up his.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.920]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   That's a good point.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   That's a good point.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   So it's not always a good thing.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   Now Twitter did notify.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.760]   They had to go and get the order unsealed.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.800]   The feds went after Twitter to find out about certain accounts, not supposedly the content
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.080]   of them, but who they're talking to though, which is creepy from following.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.400]   Yeah, it's following whom that's creepy.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.640]   I don't like that.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640]   And so what?
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.680]   So what if I follow Jason, joining us on?
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   I do.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.280]   Well, you know what I did immediately?
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.600]   I clicked follow on all of these accounts, including the WikiLeaks, the Assange, everything
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   because you know what?
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   We need to all do that.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.440]   We need to all say, okay.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.440]   Is it illegal to follow him?
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.440]   All right.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   I'm going to follow him.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.360]   So Applebaum came back in two days ago in Seattle and he was questioned, not arrested,
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.760]   but questioned there for half an hour.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.560]   Here's the interesting thing for our audience, I think.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.080]   He was not neither carrying a phone nor computer.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080]   They wanted his phone.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   They wanted his computer.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   Didn't have one.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   But have it.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.160]   All he had was a thumb drive with the Declaration of Independence encoded in it.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160]   Right on, dude.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:45.640]   They couldn't be coded.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.960]   And so you have to tell him, well, it says, okay, I'll give you the first sentence.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.440]   When in the course of human events, see if you can get from here.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   He's in them.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:00.200]   So these were really interesting kind of cloud questions of whether or not if you're going
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.160]   abroad or if you're somebody like him at high risk, you never carry a device with you.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:10.600]   You go borrow someone's, as somebody said later in Twitter, you laptop surfs and you use
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:16.560]   somebody else's machine or you bring in a chrome machine that has nothing stored on it
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.280]   and no way to do a backdoor into it.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.280]   Maybe there was a case for Chrome OS.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.840]   Yeah, it was very interesting.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   I thought.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:30.320]   And so he's tweeted the story on Twitter, fearing somewhat that this might affect his
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   next trip to Canada in a week.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:38.480]   But I think it's very important for our folks to be aware of this and think about the implications,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   including the one you just mentioned.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:45.080]   Well, I can vouch for the fact that the Canadian authorities, thanks to ACTA, by the way, will
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.720]   in fact confiscate laptops at will.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.920]   They say it's, of course, to search for child porn.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.640]   Oh, look at the puppy.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.240]   You just came to join in here.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.240]   Yeah, I'm sure she.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.640]   I would not have guessed that as your dog.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   I would not.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   Another one.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.520]   Wait, wait, wait, show the tail.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.720]   Does it have a puffy tail?
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.560]   It's a poodle, I should say, full standard poodle.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.560]   It looks like.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.960]   Yep, puffy tail.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.120]   And now there's a white one.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.600]   That's more like three, actually.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.120]   The one's hiding somewhere.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.400]   Oh, this one's a puppy.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.680]   So you do the full grooming thing, it looks like.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.680]   Well, Rosie does.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   I don't.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.080]   But yes, but they don't do their sort of fancy one that, you know, looks silly.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.400]   They're just, they're still like dogs.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.160]   It's an everyday poodle cut.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.160]   Well, this is this one set up.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.160]   So she's still really fluffy.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.160]   It's like a sheet.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.600]   I love how poodles look when they're un-trimmed.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.800]   I think they're just so cute and fluffy.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.640]   I want to sneeze, just looking at that.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   I love the poodles.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   They're poodles.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   They're poodles.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   They don't.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   They don't.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   That's right.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.640]   That's what they say.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   There's no danger.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   There's a poodle.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   I have a hypoallergenic.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   Poodles are.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   What are their names, Kevin?
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   This is nothing going.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.120]   I'm expecting the little white one is Sophie.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.200]   And the big white one who's hiding somewhere else is Casey.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.680]   Casey, Sophie, and what?
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.480]   Casey, Sophie and Abigail.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   This is an unexpected boat lair and, you know, it's been awesome to you.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   Apigany.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.640]   He's just, he's just shouting out the back door.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.520]   We're the good Greek names anymore.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   All right.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.560]   Well, I'm going to follow Iowearr and I guess we should just say everybody follow him.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.520]   He's only got 7,000 followers.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   Let's show our support.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   Follow him.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.280]   There's something that doesn't think about, you know, last time Jake went through customs,
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.600]   they took all his devices anyways.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.880]   It makes perfect sense for him not to carry anything.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   That's right.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.720]   They're looking for, they say we're looking for child pornography or we're looking for,
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.640]   they actually look for piracy, by the way, which is all, I think a lot of what it is,
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.360]   is they're doing the bidding of the record industry of all things.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   But they're not looking for weapons.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   They're not looking for contraband.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   They're looking for what we need.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360]   No, it's not for safety.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.240]   And by the way, the fritt thing that freaked me out was when he, when he hit Seattle, they
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.560]   knew that he had tweeted right before.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.080]   Oh, they're watching.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.520]   Well, I guess Twitter is not safe anymore.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.320]   I thought no, but I thought the feds didn't know about the Twitter.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   Right.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.680]   I guess they did.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   Actually, let's not take a break.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.040]   Let's go right into our picks of the week, starting with Gina and her tip of the week,
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.320]   which I just discovered when I went to our Google Docs.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.160]   Yeah, if you go into Google Docs, you'll get a little pop up that says that you can upload
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.920]   up to one gigabyte of video through Google Docs storage and you can upload all kinds of
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.600]   different files to Google Docs.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.960]   That's been for a while.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.660]   But this new feature is that you can upload video and then there's a built in player.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.920]   So you can play back that video right inside Google Docs.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.760]   I, you know, I originally tweeted about this and said that I think this is an odd feature
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.920]   considering that they, you know, own YouTube.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.280]   Does it support H.264?
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.400]   It does, as a matter of fact.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.680]   WebM and peg four, three GGP, two 64 and I pick four, AVI, WMB, FLV.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.160]   Yes, the Google Docs did not get the memo.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.920]   Google Docs didn't get the memo.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.080]   But you can play back these videos inside Google Docs and you can share them with the
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.880]   same mechanisms that you can share with Google Docs.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.800]   So I tweeted like this is a weird feature and I swear the next day my sister said to
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.240]   me, Hey, that video you showed me when I was at your place.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.320]   Like, can I send it to me somehow?
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.520]   And it's something that I don't want to publish.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.520]   I just want to send it to my sister and I said, yes, it there is.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   Is there a size?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   There must be a size one gigabyte.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   Oh, that's a lot.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   Up to one gigabyte video.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520]   It's amazing.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.080]   And this is an absolute domain as well.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.080]   This works.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.400]   This is just on every dose apps as well.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.560]   If I go to my looking at my apps right now, yeah, does it make a lot of sense for me?
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   It does.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.560]   It does.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560]   It does.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.800]   It does support a score and Kevin made the point on Twitter too.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.280]   Like this makes a lot of sense for a business or a small organization that wants to share
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   video.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   Oh, gosh.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   I mean, a gigabytes a ton.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.280]   That's an hour or more.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.280]   I mean, you know, you shouldn't be sending people hour long videos anyway.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.520]   Well, you should still understand too, because they don't store stuff that's going
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.920]   to be watched once forever.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.920]   I know.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920]   Right.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.920]   This does.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920]   Or email.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920]   Presumably this does.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.400]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:00.480]   They first do a tip since Gina rejected, but I'm so enamored of this.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.760]   Android version of Google Translate now, you can translate speech to speech.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   Let me try this.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.480]   Watch it will not work on the darn.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.160]   So I'm going to input text.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.680]   This is so cool.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.280]   I like to eat apples.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   What languages?
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.080]   And now I'll play it.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   Is that true?
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.080]   Is it right?
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.080]   Is it good?
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.000]   Yeah, does this make it is it colloquial?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Wow.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.880]   What's amazing to me is you can now have a conversation with someone, right?
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.440]   You can talk into it and say this and it's the star travel fish.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   It's the battle fish.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.440]   It's really cool.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   I just, okay.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.840]   I said just a minute ago about the, this is going to change.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.320]   This is going to change everything.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.120]   No, I don't even want to do my tip.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.240]   You're right about that because, you know, I'm at the point now where I use Google Translate,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.480]   of course, to translate my really bad German lazily.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.120]   But now I see something in Swedish or Portuguese and I'm not scared of it.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.040]   It doesn't become this impenetrable wall anymore.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040]   I can, I can just look at it and get a chance.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   That's great.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   All right.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]   You want a number of the week?
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:13.520]   15% of customers in the UK who complain versus via a social network expect an answer within
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520]   60 minutes.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.800]   And do they get one is a question?
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.960]   Well, that's the other question.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   Of course it's Britain.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   So of course they don't.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.720]   Six percent want the answer in 10 minutes, but I figure that's only oriented and scobled.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.680]   50% a day is good enough.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.040]   That's very British, right?
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]   Kevin.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.760]   We used to queuing.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.040]   And very orderly cures unlike the French and bad service.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.120]   A day's a day still seems fast to me.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.160]   But anyway, that's good.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.360]   Well, you really kind of, you know, put the kibosh on my tool because your tool translate
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.920]   speech.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.320]   I was just going to show the fact that the new Google goggles will solve soda.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.320]   Goof puzzles.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   This is so cool.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   This is so cool.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.160]   That is pretty cool though.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.040]   You take a picture of a Sudoku and it solves it.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040]   Brilliant marketing twist.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   I don't have to.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   Really good way to get people to download goggles.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   Hey, big guy in this paper.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.800]   Well, the video, the video does a demo.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   Oh, I could do the video.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.760]   I mean, that's pretty cool.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.680]   You know, and when I want to wow people, I show them, it's on the iPhone.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.360]   I show them that that that program.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.160]   What's it called that that will look at a sign word lens and translate it?
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   Yes.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.560]   Live in amazing freaking times.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.660]   Indeed.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:40.000]   I mean, I was talking to somebody at CES who's an old friend, Richard Hart.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.640]   He used to be on CNET and he had a show called The Next Step for a long time on television.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.920]   And now he teaches TV to the Academy of Art in San Francisco.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   I said, "I must be great."
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.120]   Well, you can confirm this to me actually, Jeff.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.520]   I said, "It must be great to be teaching TV to these smart kids who really understand
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.520]   technology."
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.520]   He said, "You know what?
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.440]   The younger generation does not understand technology the same way we do.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.500]   Because they grew up with it, they have no curiosity about it.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.740]   They have no wonder.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.300]   And they don't know from file systems or command lines or anything."
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.140]   I, that's curmudgeonly talk.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.420]   No, I think that the beauty is that they don't need to know that stuff and they can pick
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   up.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.420]   Yes.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.580]   We're going to almost require every student.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.300]   We already require every student in my journalism school to have a Mac laptop.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:34.800]   We're going to strongly recommend that they buy an iPhone or an Android device because
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.180]   this is the always in case journalism device.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   At the video on these things.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.180]   It's true.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   It is the future of journalism, isn't it?
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.180]   Right.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.500]   And I can capture anything I can do, all kinds of things.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.500]   They've got to know this.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:48.380]   So, know that the beauty is the tools are so simple, you don't have to geek out.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:54.580]   Alex Lindsey, who is, you know, does Pixel Core and is one of our contributors, was going
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.380]   to report on CES that said he took his iPhone and shot iPhone videos about 40 different
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.380]   products.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.500]   The quality superb, it's right there in the field.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.060]   He uploads it from the field.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.540]   I mean, it's, it is transformational.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]   Incredible.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]   It changes everything.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.540]   This changes everything.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.540]   Do we, so do go?
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.540]   Okay.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.540]   All right.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.540]   Changes everything.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.740]   You know, history of this to do a good thing.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.420]   There was an iPhone app that does this, right?
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   Oh, no.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.820]   This was Peter Norvig, who's Google's head of research.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820]   Oh, you guy.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.900]   He originally wrote how to solve every Sudoku puzzle.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.860]   And he says he did this because Sudoku's a denial of service attack on the human intellect.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.900]   And his wife's infected with his virus.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.020]   And he wanted to convince that that it had been solved.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.020]   He shouldn't waste her time.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:38.060]   By the way, that's a great art of soap every year.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.060]   That's a great art of soap.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.060]   So he wrote the article.
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.020]   You don't drink me birds too.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.140]   Even Google can't solve angry birds.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.020]   I want four stars or three stars on every single level.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.020]   So bad.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.020]   That's what I'm working on.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:57.540]   It's not so bad to go through the whole thing, although the oh, yes, one is tough.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.780]   But once you get through the whole thing, one star, then the three stars, that's what
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.420]   you really got to go for.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:06.380]   So I've put a link in the chat for the source code for how to solve every Sudoku.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.620]   It's an article as well as source code, though, right?
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.100]   I mean, it's kind of nice.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.860]   It's basically explaining what he's doing.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.860]   Everybody should read this.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:14.860]   It's a computer science.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:18.700]   If you're into computers, oh, we've just de-dossed it.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.700]   It's temporary.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.700]   He just took his.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.340]   So is it hosted at Google?
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.340]   It's not the only.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.340]   Yeah, we de-dossed it.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.740]   Sorry about that, Peter.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:31.220]   Oh, never mind.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.220]   Never mind.
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.300]   I should have warned you.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:38.060]   There are not many servers that can survive an onslaught from the Twit Army.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.620]   We are going to show that video in just a second.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.420]   But first, let me say goodbye to our fantastic panel.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.260]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.140]   I think your insight is hugely valuable in topics like this.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.140]   We love having you on.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.220]   Kevin is at tumblevision.tv.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:58.820]   If you want to watch a fantastic show about tumbling, the idea of being a host in social
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.860]   media, I guess that's a short way of describing it, tumblevision.tv.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.860]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:05.860]   Thank you.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:11.380]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.340]   And you do not have to have an iPhone or a laptop to listen to him, but it helps.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.860]   You can also read his blog at buzzmachine.com.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.860]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:20.220]   Goodbye, Leo.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.220]   What?
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:30.220]   It didn't work, but that's okay.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.420]   Never mind.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.100]   This doesn't change a thing.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:39.660]   And Gina Turbani is at smarterware.org where she is a fantastic blogger, founder of LifeHacker.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:43.580]   She continues to write there and is working on this incredible think tank.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.220]   Earth, I'm sorry, think up.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.220]   Think up.
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.820]   Which is a Twitter analyzer par excellence.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.820]   Great to be here.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.820]   Great show.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   Great to have you all.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.820]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:57.280]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google, Wednesday afternoons, 1 p.m.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]   Pacific, 4 p.m.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:04.740]   Eastern at live.twit.tv or download it from your favorite podcast place or just go to
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.540]   twit.tv/twig.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:11.780]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, how to solve.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.780]   Is it su doku?
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.940]   Yeah, if it can tell me how to pronounce it, I'd be right.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.620]   How to pronounce su doku.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.020]   Well, if you logged in his route, it's just goo.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.940]   It's you, doku.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.060]   Now, that's a geek joke.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060]   That is.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.260]   I'm Casey, a software engineer at Google.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.740]   And today, I'm going to try to be this a doku master at her own game.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:45.620]   Or actually, this phone is going to beat her using Google goggles.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.620]   Go!
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.620]   She's good.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620]   She's real good.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.620]   He's real casual.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:21:17.740]   This is it.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:29.420]   Look at this.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   First of all, it turns into a puzzle you can use, which is cool.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:35.420]   Phew!
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.420]   Done.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.260]   This is not right to you?
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   Not dead.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.940]   No, that's cool.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.940]   Thanks guys.
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.340]   Take care.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:48.920]   (gentle music)
