[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.280]   Episode 57, recorded August 25, 2010.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.680]   Where are my Funyuns?

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.440]   to show the covers of the Google verse and the cloud.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.680]   Joining us is always from her cloud chamber in beautiful San
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.880]   Diego, California.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.240]   Miss Gina Trapani.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.520]   Hello, earthlings.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.040]   Via Trapani, Cecilia.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.000]   Good to have you, Gina.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.280]   Jeff Jarvis has the week off.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.080]   We've got a great substitute in studio in Google.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.280]   In fact, he's inside the Googleplex.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.600]   Mr. G looking around for the black helicopters.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   Mr. Christopher.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.640]   Actually, my name's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.760]   Open source program manager.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.720]   He does have the goatee, so I think we're OK for Google.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   It's nice to have you, Chris.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.880]   Chris was the host for a long time of Floss Weekly.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.040]   And I've known Chris for years pre-Google.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.080]   He did open source and Linux stuff
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.360]   for us on the screen savers many years ago.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.520]   Yeah, it's a long time ago.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.000]   How long have you been at Google now?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It was a long time.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.040]   Yeah, I've been at Google for six years now.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.800]   When do you stop being a nuclear?
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.400]   You technically stop being a nuclear
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.720]   when your nuclear balloon deflates.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   It's one of those Mylar balloons that takes a while.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.760]   That's a good way to do it.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.280]   It's a timeline.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.600]   We got to start doing that, Lisa.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.520]   Can we give Mylar balloons to what we call Tubi's?
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   Tubi's.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.880]   Twittlers, twittlers, twittlers.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.760]   Do it, twits.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.880]   And then as your balloon sags, then you suddenly
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.720]   you gain in status as your balloon goes down.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840]   So it's great to have you both.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.680]   Lots to talk about.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.480]   Google had an announcement today.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.000]   And we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   Adding voice to Gmail.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.520]   That could be potentially huge.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.240]   It's very exciting.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.680]   Is there anything exciting going on in your neck of the woods?
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Open source and a public sector manager, Mr. Boy.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.400]   Well, you know, I took on this new group in DC doing sort
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   of government-y focus things.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.560]   And it's all very exciting, like our Pulling Locations API.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.040]   Yes.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.600]   And so, you know, for your finding, voting locations,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.880]   if you put in your address, you find out
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   where you can vote and stuff.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.200]   And then we also handle what's called Google Moderator, which
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   was used by the president for Open for Questions.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.280]   I keep saying I got to do more of that.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   I think that moderator has a huge potential for us.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.160]   Yeah, it could be really neat.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.360]   You know, I mean, because I can barely keep up with the chat.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.120]   I mean, it's like screaming by, you know.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.280]   So, you know, I already apologize for not being able to do that.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.360]   Well, it's all a tools issue.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.280]   We're going to talk about tools in just a second.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   You know, we're doing-- and I'd love you to come.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.600]   Tim O'Reilly has been big on government 2.0, you know,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.440]   transparency using tools to make government more effective.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.720]   He's written books on it.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.160]   And we are actually doing a special Friday on this
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.040]   at 5 p.m. Pacific 8 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.560]   If you'd like to tune in--
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.160]   This Friday?
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.280]   This Friday.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.240]   And if you'd like to come by, we have a lot of guests.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.360]   It's going to be very interesting.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.000]   But I'd love to have you come on and talk about what you guys
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.440]   are doing.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   Gene is also working with government.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.640]   Yes.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.080]   Yeah, well, actually, Chris has to do with Google Summer of Code,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.440]   which is Google's program that gets university students
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.480]   involved in open source projects, which expert labs, which
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   is where I work--
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.720]   Well, that's for your expert now.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.600]   Yeah, it's for-- you know, we're a mentoring organization.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   So we had two students over the summer working on the project,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120]   which is ThinkUp, used to be Think Tank.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.920]   It is now called ThinkUp, which is an open source project.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.720]   Good name.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.880]   Like the new name.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.400]   That's great.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   Thank you.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.800]   Fiber to Firefox kind of moments.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400]   Was that a user suggested a name?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.920]   ThinkUp.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.800]   It was a name that was suggested actually by--
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720]   that was ideas were gathered by the app.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   It was suggested on Twitter.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.800]   And the app picked it up.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.680]   And we was like, yep, think up.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.720]   That works.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   That's cool.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   Well, we were glad to have you both today.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.560]   I guess we'll get to the Google Voice on Gmail in just a second.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.600]   But before we do that, I suppose I should mention the Buzz thing.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.200]   My Buzz pill post.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.960]   Yeah, and that got a lot of traction here inside the company, too.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.680]   Oh, god, it makes me feel really bad.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   So let me give you that-- let me tell you what happened.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.960]   And then we could talk about my epiphany.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.080]   And Gina wants to talk me down.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   And I saved it.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.400]   I was so late.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   She's the angel on your shoulder and I'm the devil.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   I should get right in the middle because you really
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.880]   look quite a kind of like the angel in the middle.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.600]   I need a halo and Kristine's horn.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.320]   You're both on my left shoulder, but I think we'll figure it out.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.800]   The genesis of this was August 6th,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.520]   I was on the road.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.600]   We were taking Abby to college.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.040]   But I love Buzz.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.160]   You know I'm a Buzz fan.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.880]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.880]   In fact, from day one, even in the face of the privacy issues
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   that came up and the lack of uptake,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.480]   I've wanted Buzz to succeed because I
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   miss threaded conversations on Twitter.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.720]   I think Buzz could be so much better.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.320]   So what happened was August 6th, I was on the road.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.720]   And when I'm on the road, I always
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   use the Buzz widget on my Android phone
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.320]   to post pictures and little just little things.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.720]   And I'm posting along and I get to August 22nd, which
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.200]   was a couple of days ago.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.040]   And I'm seeing all this stuff when I go to my name.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.560]   But I'm not seeing it in the public timeline.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.640]   I'm thinking that's kind of odd.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.320]   And the biggest thing that should have been a real red flag
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.120]   was I wasn't getting much engagement or any engagement.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.560]   A little bit.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.480]   That's why it was hard to detect.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.880]   There were one or two comments.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.760]   But there were no likes and there were very few comments.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.240]   And usually my stuff gets more than that.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.120]   So I started investigating and I realized,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   wait a minute, Buzz can tweet, which has been very reliable,
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.400]   is not porting stuff over to Twitter.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.640]   So none of that got into Twitter,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.520]   including show announcements from all of last week.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.680]   Because I usually start a show by announcing it on Buzz,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.840]   which then ports to Twitter through Buzz can tweet.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.080]   So I was suddenly realized, well, there's something wrong here.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.200]   And as I looked into it, I realized,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.280]   not only is there something wrong,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.800]   but I can't ask for help because nobody's seeing my buzzes.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.960]   So I managed to get the attention of a Clinton,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.480]   do it Clinton, and later, out of Wale and out of London.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   And three days later, they said, yeah, you found a bug.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.920]   They said it's a very rare bug that would only affect
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.880]   somebody with a lot of followers.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   But the bug was that when somebody deleted their Google account,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.840]   anyone who's following me deleted their Google account,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   suddenly I would stop being visible.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   It's like they deleted me.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.640]   And it's a weird bug.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.280]   I don't even, it must have been difficult to track down.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.040]   We did a lot of tests, postings, and stuff, and I apologize.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.320]   But they did finally figure it out.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   And a couple of days ago, all of my buzzes went on Twitter,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.400]   causing little annoyance, I must say,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.920]   for my followers on Twitter.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.720]   And it seems to be all OK.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.240]   So no one deletes their Google account,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   and no one has as many followers as you Leo.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.720]   These are the two things that I take from this.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.440]   Yeah, I know.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.000]   They said it was a long-standing bug.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.920]   It's the kind of thing that gets creeps into code
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   and you wouldn't see because it's a weird confluence
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.800]   of situations that happen.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.200]   Anyway, that's not important.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.240]   That got fixed upon.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.400]   So the part about your post that I
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.120]   thought was really interesting was sort of the part that
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.880]   dwelled on the ephemeral nature of a lot of these things
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.920]   and how you felt like you were, in the end,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.160]   narcissistically speaking into the wind.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.440]   Yes, I think I called myself a chatterbox onon spewing
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   my little words into the wind.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.960]   By the way, I wrote that at one in the morning
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.560]   in a kind of a ditzy.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   But it was kind of an epiphany for me because I said,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.840]   not only did no one say anything, but I didn't even know this.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.000]   So it was almost three weeks of content
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.240]   that I was spewing that nobody saw and nobody noticed.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.360]   Now, admittedly, that's a little narcissistic
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.920]   to assume that, oh, well, people are going to say,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.000]   oh, where's your wonderful stuff?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.920]   So that's not kind of what I was saying.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.080]   I just felt like, you know, I really
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.480]   get the feeling that Twitter and to a lesser degree,
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.040]   but somewhat buzz and even Facebook
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.280]   are just everybody talking at once and nobody listening.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.960]   So what I said is, well, maybe I've misused these tools.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.360]   Maybe what I should be doing is posting stuff
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.200]   that I want that I want to be more than ephemera,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.880]   which can even be trivia like pictures from my trip
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.280]   that I take with my phone, my camera phone,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.560]   on my blog first, then have them publish upstream
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.400]   to the comments.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.480]   Because what I think you need, I think you need two things.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.960]   You need the perm-- and we've talked about this,
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.360]   Gino, with Jeff many times before.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.520]   You need the permanence of something you own
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.080]   that you-- so you control the content.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.640]   It's yours.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.440]   It's in a place where you know where it is.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.160]   But you also don't want to force people to come to you
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.240]   to consume it or, more importantly, to engage with it.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.960]   So you also want to participate in the comments.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.040]   So you want something that goes in both places.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   And actually Buzz turns out to be a perfect platform for that.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.360]   But in order to do that, you have
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.880]   to do the one thing that everybody condemned me for.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.800]   They said, but Leo, that's because you were just
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.080]   using a Buzz as a megaphone.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.480]   You were just broadcasting.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.880]   And in fact, the lesson I learned
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.640]   is, yeah, you should just broadcast.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.240]   That's the right way to use it.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   No.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.920]   But I mean, I would engage with other people's posts,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   or maybe even with my own posts.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.240]   What do you think?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.840]   I mean, I feel like social media is about conversations.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.520]   It's about conversations with your friends.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.120]   You could say the conversations were--
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.880]   they're a femoral.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   They go away.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   But I think that it has to be there's a happy medium.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.760]   I think there's broadcasting stuff that you've done.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.160]   Hey, here's this thing that I've done.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.360]   And it's in my database here.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.840]   And you have to come here to look at it.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.120]   And also, hey, how was your day?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.360]   What do you think about this?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.200]   I use Twitter, primarily Twitter, but other places
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.400]   to post seeds of ideas and see what kind of reaction
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.040]   or response I get back and then grow that into a larger piece
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.400]   of content that might go onto my blog.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.240]   But I do very much feel the same way.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.000]   And we've talked about this about putting content
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.120]   into a place that you own, a data store that you own.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.640]   That's why I like hosting my own blog.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.720]   And that's why I built ThinkUp.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.960]   Because I like the idea that I can't find all of my tweets
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.280]   via the API on Twitter freaks me out.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.320]   It's been this place where I've been pumping
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.400]   content for a long time.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.120]   And I want to have that database on my side.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.000]   So I built ThinkUp to kind of archive my tweets
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   and Flickr photos and buzzes and all kind of inputs
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.440]   into these different networks.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.840]   Don't you think Twitter's really rotten for conversation,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.000]   though?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   I mean, it really wasn't designed for conversation.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.560]   It was designed to be a megaphone.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.440]   Let's face it.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   No, I'm sure.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.560]   You're right.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.880]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.280]   That's true.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.120]   And buzz is definitely--
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.520]   And that's why I like buzz.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.200]   Right.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   Right.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.520]   Well, you know, I mean, so buzzes actually
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   quite go to the conversations.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.280]   But people, I think, love Twitter for the megaphone aspect.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.920]   But they get to say what they think.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.360]   Darn it.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.600]   And the whole world is listening or not.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.640]   Or not.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.120]   But they're saying it.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.080]   And honestly, I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.560]   That's why I actually really liked Twitter when it came out
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.880]   and why I use it.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.480]   Well, there's a second reason is it's very easy.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.000]   Right.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   It's very easy.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.840]   It's easy to get.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.280]   It's easy to use.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.600]   Buzz is a little more-- and anything that has--
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.000]   Jaiku, which I prefer over Twitter as well, which I think
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.360]   was kind of the acorn that the oak tree of buzz came out of.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.840]   Really, I liked it because it was threaded conversations.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.920]   There was much more engagement.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.520]   And the engagement was tied to the original post.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.000]   But people don't like these systems.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.280]   Buzz, let's face it, Chris, buzz has not received much uptake.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.240]   It's a lot smaller than Twitter.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.040]   I honestly don't know the numbers.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.160]   I'd imagine it's smaller than Twitter, though.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.360]   Well, I could tell you it's small.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.120]   It's obvious.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.440]   If I post a link on buzz and a post a link on Twitter,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.800]   90% of the engagement comes from Twitter.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   Of course, I have 22,000 followers on Twitter
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.200]   and only 18,000 on.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.680]   Well, but I think that's maybe the order of magnitude
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.080]   for everybody except Lady Gaga.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   Does Lady Gaga have a buzz account?
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.560]   I don't know.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.760]   I think Miley Cyrus does.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.840]   That's right, and uses it.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.880]   Oh, I thought she wore off social media
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.280]   and said it was like a waste of life.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.040]   That's interesting.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.280]   She snuck back on buzz.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.800]   She did.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.480]   She snuck back.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.600]   You know, the problems with buzz--
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.720]   Suck back into the public eye.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.600]   That's what she was doing.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.520]   The issue with buzz for me-- and I had the same kind
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.800]   of experience with a Google Reader--
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.320]   is like, I just like, oh, god.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.040]   It's like another inbox that I have to go through.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.200]   And Twitter just feels this very free and short and brief.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.560]   And it gives me that sense of ambient intimacy with folks
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.760]   who I don't talk to every day.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.200]   I follow Chris on Twitter.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.600]   And I feel like I have some sense of what's going on with them,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.360]   even though we don't talk.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.160]   But without requiring me to mark items as red or like
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.800]   or comments or click on links, it's just 140 characters.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.280]   And that's it.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.800]   And if there's a link--
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.960]   tweets that have links in them kind of bug me after a while.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.360]   So I'm like, I don't want to have to launch us
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.200]   and do another browser.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.960]   I just want to know a little tidbit about your life
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   right here from now.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.360]   It's one more tap impression.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   I think it's just an inbox issue for me.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.320]   Just having all those on red items.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   I don't need any more on red items.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   I just kind of--
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.920]   I don't feel any responsibility to hit next page
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.640]   on that front page of people I follow.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.720]   I admit it.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.240]   I do.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   I do.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.760]   I do.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.720]   Look at that seatabona.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.800]   I like to read right all the way down.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.440]   That's impossible.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.120]   How many people are you following?
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.600]   On Twitter, about 1,500 on buzz, about 120.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240]   You can't follow 1,500 people.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.640]   You'll see the first couple of pages
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.040]   and they'll say, older tweets are not available.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.440]   And you can go a few pages back, though.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.920]   I mean, actually with 1,500 people,
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   you can go more pages back because you have more content
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.840]   to follow.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.120]   I guess it does seem like-- this is, I guess,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.960]   the bottom line for me.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.400]   We all are putting a lot of energy
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.760]   into these social media networks.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.840]   And I wonder how much listening there is versus how much talking.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.920]   And it struck me.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.560]   And by the way, if you read between the lines,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.800]   I'm blaming myself as much as--
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.400]   this is not an accusatory of either the tools
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.360]   or the people who use them.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.320]   It's myself.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.600]   There's a lot more talking than listening.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.960]   Well, I hate to say, Leo.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.400]   People tune in to you because they
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.880]   want to hear what you have to say.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.360]   Lesso for Regina and even lesso for me.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.040]   I mean, your use of these tools is
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.600]   going to have more of an outward effect than--
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.560]   Well, how do-- OK, so tell me what it looks like from popular.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.680]   What does it look like from your end as you use this?
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.040]   I don't think it looks any different.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   And that's very deceptive.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.960]   So I follow about 300 people.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.520]   And so I can kind of keep up with them
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.040]   when I have a few minutes to serve Twitter.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.520]   And I don't get as many direct messages as you do.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.240]   I don't get as many ads as you do.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.880]   So that's where the analogy falls apart.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.240]   But I use it because I want to drive people to one website
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.960]   or another or something or another.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.880]   Or I just want to like yammer.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.200]   And I'm yammering into the wind.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.760]   And I'm hoping people like me or whatever.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.620]   And it is a little bit-- well, we said this--
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.200]   It's a little bit of high school, isn't it?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.920]   It's really a little high school.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.720]   Except for I skipped a lot of high school.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.760]   But we all just-- it's all our little cliques.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.120]   And we just want people to like this.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.880]   It's a competition for the cleverells quips.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.280]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.480]   Well, that seems awfully narcissistic.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.040]   It is.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.160]   It's a really good way to get your lead down, though.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.640]   It's true.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.680]   Your lead is everything.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.920]   140 characters.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.320]   That's it.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.440]   Yeah, it's a really good way to get your lead down.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.640]   And to tweak it when people say, hey, that's--
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.360]   what about this?
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.120]   Or that's not right?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.040]   Or you didn't get this right?
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.400]   I think that the irony is while people always
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.640]   are paying lip service to engagement and participation,
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.880]   it is a megaphone, ultimately.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.360]   Yes.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.320]   And that's OK.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.960]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.920]   OK.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.360]   So to me, this is really--
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   It's just really bad about that, Leo.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   It really devolves down to what this mostly always does
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.840]   devolve down to is tool talk.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.760]   It's about the tools.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.520]   And using the tools appropriately,
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   understanding what the parameters of the tools are,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.960]   maybe not having false expectations,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.920]   that Twitter, for instance, is a conversational medium.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.520]   So on in the chat room, said, Twitter's a cocktail party.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.560]   And it's actually a pretty good analogy.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.760]   But it's a cocktail party where everybody's talking
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.920]   and nobody's listening.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.560]   And everyone's like three drinks into it.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.720]   You hear your name out of the corner of your ear,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.160]   and you go, oh, they're talking about me over there.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.320]   I'm going to go talk to those people.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   It's a cocktail party.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.680]   It is a good analogy.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.640]   Well, I never liked cocktail parties either.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.520]   There's that drunken the corner, just saying crazy stuff.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   That's Randall Schwartz.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   Just ignore him.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.640]   I think, Leo, do you engage with folks on Twitter?
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.760]   Do you respond to people on Twitter?
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.720]   Do you @replyfolks?
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   I do.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.240]   And you do.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   And you do it on buzz as well.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.080]   But you do engage.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.680]   I mean, you can have conversations go back and forth.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.520]   It's not as easy.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.000]   Here's a great quote from Cara Fisher.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.760]   Hermes in our chat room says, Cara Swisher says,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.360]   Twitter is like a library with all the books on the floor.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.400]   I guess that's my frustration.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.800]   So I'm going to actually, in my tools segment
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.320]   at the end of the show, I am going
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.440]   to talk about at least a preliminary set of tools
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.760]   that I want to use that will let me use the blog
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.360]   as the primary publishing point.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   And Kevin Marks said this in a comment to me
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.800]   after-- while all this was happening.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.080]   By the way, I just want to point out,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.880]   that blog post got well over 2,000 comments on my blog,
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.840]   via Twitter, buzz, Facebook, all the other social media
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.040]   being piped in using something called JSKit Echo,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.720]   which is going to be one of the things I'm going to talk about.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.960]   If you have the right tools and Pub/Sub, Hubbub, and Salmon,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.480]   and all of these APIs that are being developed,
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.360]   in fact, it might be possible to have the best of both worlds,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.040]   a permanent record and an engaged commons.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.160]   Anyway, I'll talk about what I use.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.880]   So the only thing I would say is, if the tool you're
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   going to talk about is Wave, I've got some bad news.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.800]   Don't make Gina cry again.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.440]   It's not nice.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.360]   You are so mean, Kristobona.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.000]   I know it's so sad.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.640]   Moving on, item two.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.840]   Big announcement this morning.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.480]   Item two.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.280]   Turning the page.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.640]   What was that guy saying?
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.080]   Page two?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.840]   He's passed away, by the way.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.360]   Page two?
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.480]   Hello, Americans.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.760]   Item two.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.600]   And it turns into a commercial, isn't it?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.560]   It's always a page two, it's always a commercial.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.480]   Google rolling out only in the US--
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.720]   I'm sorry, I should always say this,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.160]   because we have a huge international audience.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.000]   At least 30% of the show is outside the US.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.080]   Which means a third of you won't be able to use this.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.520]   It is US only, because it's Google--
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.840]   I guess it's Google Voice Space.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.640]   Free VoIP calls to and from Gmail.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.880]   How does that work, Gina?
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.320]   Have you been able to use it yet?
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   I haven't been able to use it yet.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.560]   It's not in my account yet.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.000]   It's rolling out in the next few days.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.920]   But from what I understand, it uses Google's chat--
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.720]   or Gmail's chat feature.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.120]   So you can do voice calls.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.840]   So you have to install the plug-in for Google Voice
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.240]   chat and video chat.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.560]   And you have your headset on.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.600]   You're sitting at your computer.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.400]   You can dial a phone from your computer.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.880]   And it's basically Skype out.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.600]   But for free inside the US--
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.240]   And you can call phones?
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.800]   You can call landline phones.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.200]   Yeah, cell phones, regular phone.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.840]   Free?
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.880]   Free US Canada till the end of the year,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.160]   and cheap internationally.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.720]   So I'm not sure it's going to happen till--
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.200]   they said till at least the end of the year.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.160]   So I'm not sure what happens after that.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.240]   But for now, free, yes.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   Wow.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.400]   And it's connected to your Google Voice account.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.720]   So if you have a Google Voice number,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.760]   that's the number that will show up in the caller ID
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.600]   to other calls.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.800]   And you can actually receive calls through Gmail
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.280]   to your Google Voice number.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.200]   So right now, with Google Voice, you
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.720]   can set it to ring your different phones.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.440]   You can now set it when this is enabled.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.760]   You have it in your account.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.840]   You can now set it to ring Gmail chat.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.080]   So if you're at your computer, you can receive a call,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.720]   as well as make one.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.200]   So this is the little video that Google prepared.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.960]   1876, telephone, 2008.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.600]   Gmail, there was a caveman segment a little earlier.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   That would be missed.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.480]   Chris, is there a whole department at Google doing this?
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   You know, I think there must be.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.760]   They're doing more and more great--
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.520]   I'm not complaining.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.920]   Great videos around this--
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   Well, in some ways, the comic book was like the forerunner.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   That's right.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.280]   And the Chrome comic.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.200]   Well, we could do anything that's crazy comic.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.680]   Yeah, love that Chrome comic.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.160]   By the way, that's a collector's item now, right?
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   I saved mine.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.240]   Oh, you have the Japanese one.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   No.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.920]   So our Japanese office did a second one, a follow-on.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.880]   And they translated the first one into Japanese.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.240]   Oh, that's so neat.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.760]   It's really cool.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.160]   So jealous.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.640]   So now it's interesting because, Gina, you mentioned a couple
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.120]   of weeks ago that you no longer had to do that third party
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   system where you enter a number.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.560]   And then Google Voice calls you.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.600]   It makes sense now in light of this.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.880]   So this is a direct call, right?
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.720]   You just press a button and it makes the call.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.120]   Yeah, this is a direct call.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.640]   But it's the way the Google Voice app works on your phone.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.440]   You just dial a number and it calls, which is the--
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.480]   you enter your number and then it calls you back.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.720]   Enter your number and the web interface.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.680]   Then it calls you back.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.200]   That whole thing was-- you'd have
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.920]   to do that on the iPhone, for example,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.720]   because the Google Voice app isn't there.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.880]   So yeah, this is just calling a number
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.320]   straight from your computer.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.880]   And it's really interesting.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.160]   I have a few thoughts on this.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.960]   I mean, the first obvious one is like, wow, this is going to--
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.600]   this is a big competition for Skype and Skype out.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.040]   The second one is like, I didn't have the plug-in installed
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.400]   for Gmail, Voice, and VideoChat.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.880]   I just-- I didn't use it honestly.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.680]   I went to Skype.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.400]   If I needed to do VideoChat, I went to Skype.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.320]   But this made me say, OK, I'm going to install this,
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   because this is pretty cool.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.720]   That's who this is bad for Skype.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.800]   Yeah, this is bad for Skype.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.720]   But I wonder, can you imagine doing Twig on Gmail--
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.360]   You want to try next week?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.520]   Should we try next week?
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.360]   It could be interesting.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.560]   Yeah, we should try it.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.160]   I haven't done too much video chatting with Gmail.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.880]   But it's going to give people a reason to install that plug-in
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.360]   and really dive into chat for people
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.680]   who did dive in a chat.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.360]   OK, Chris, so why does Google do this?
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   Which part, the plug-in?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.840]   Yeah, I mean, what-- look, here's my understanding.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.000]   Here's our understanding, I think, of Google.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.720]   Google's always said it.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   The more you use the internet, the happier we are,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.360]   the more money we make.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.560]   And I understand that.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.600]   More web pages means more ads.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.240]   Are they going to put ads in this?
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.760]   Where is the upside to Google on doing phones?
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.360]   I think it's one of those things that--
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.920]   I think it's part of making a whole experience out
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.680]   of Gmail and Gmail's Contact Manager and Google Voice
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.840]   and bringing the whole thing together,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.280]   like the rug in Lebowski.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.560]   It's like-- it really brought the room together, man.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   You brought the room together.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.280]   And I think it's one of those services
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.440]   that kind of pays for itself with the--
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.720]   because we give you $10 credit in Google Voice,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.080]   whatever, when you get started.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.920]   But you end up using it on international calls, I guess.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.040]   And honestly, I don't know.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.520]   Gina, you were about to make another point.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.840]   And I cut into you up, sir.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.880]   I mean, the thing that worries me is I love Gmail, right?
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   As far as I'm concerned, beyond search,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.480]   Gmail is Google's best product.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.240]   And it worries me a little bit that Google
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.280]   keeps rolling things into Gmail, like tasks, and chat,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.800]   and video, and voice, and buzz, and your contacts.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.440]   I mean, in a way, it's like there's a really good argument.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   And the strategy is clear.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.400]   It's like you have all these different features
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.760]   and products and acquisitions.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.680]   And you want to show them together to make that complete
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.720]   experience.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.680]   At the same time, sometimes I get a little worried.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.720]   Like, wow, Gmail has a lot of different settings,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.800]   capabilities, and it's just becoming this--
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.040]   it seems like if Google wants to launch a new product,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.880]   they do it in Gmail because you have 160 million users instantly.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.320]   I mean, this makes a lot of--
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.760]   You're hanging a lot of bags off the side of this Gmail engine.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.640]   Yeah, I mean, Gmail isn't Gmail anymore.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.120]   It's like G communicate.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   Amazing.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   Yeah, many--
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.160]   OK.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.240]   No, so it's funny.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.840]   Actually, I'm with Gina.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   I get kind of worried whenever we try to do that whole sort of--
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.560]   you know, throw this thing in a Gmail,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.680]   and then see if it works out.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.400]   And it's like, well, you know what that's--
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.480]   because you could say, if we'd done that with Wave,
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.000]   would that have helped Wave out?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.320]   Well, you know, probably.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.160]   Would it have slowed down Gmail?
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.040]   Well, I think every time you add something to Gmail,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.720]   it's like, I don't want to put Wave in Gmail.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.640]   That would have been a mistake in hindsight.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.080]   Now, this is a conversation that we had a couple of weeks ago.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.880]   You weren't here, Chris.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.760]   So this is a good time for you to kind of respond to this.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.640]   One of the things that seemed to us that going forward,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.680]   you don't need more programmers.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.920]   You need more social scientists.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.520]   It's no longer a programming issue.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.400]   It's more a user issue, a user interface issue.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.720]   Sure?
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.760]   No?
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   No.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.920]   So I don't know what a social scientist is.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.760]   Well, somebody who can look at how--
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.520]   It's on a human--
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.600]   It's on a human's list down.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.880]   And we have lots of people out there.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.320]   No, I know.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.600]   No, no, no, human factors.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.880]   Somebody who's an expert on human factors
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   are supposed to machine factors.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   You're probably right.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.120]   Is there any intention being paid to that at all at Google?
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:07.720]   Oh, no, no.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.600]   I do think that there is.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.040]   I personally--
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.200]   I have to admit that there are times
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.960]   when I just feel like shutting everything off in Gmail
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.080]   that might slow it down.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.840]   Well, you could use the HTML Gmail, right?
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   The Gmail basic Gmail.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.640]   You can use the pure HTML.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.000]   You can use the mobile interface.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.280]   You can force your way into that.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.600]   And then that's really crazy fast.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.640]   If not optimal and all of that.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.440]   Do you do that just by changing the user agent?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.920]   Is that all you have to do?
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.040]   Well, you can do it that way.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.240]   But there's a question mark.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.680]   I'm sure Gina knows this.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.720]   Oh, there's a command like a URL that you use.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.360]   So you are all that changes the UI.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.880]   OK.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.360]   Much like you can change it to HTML or a shut off chat
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.120]   or whatever.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.280]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.680]   I've had chat shut off for years,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.920]   just because I feel like, you know what?
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.800]   When I'm processing my inbox and I'm dealing with email,
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.480]   I just don't want to deal with chats as well.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.880]   I'm just-- you know, I use kind of a separate IM client for that.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.280]   Maybe I'm like purist.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.520]   I like Gmail fast.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.200]   I use a couple of grease monkey scripts that hide a couple of stuff
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.880]   that I don't need.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.120]   You know, the send invites to your friends.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.680]   Chat, spam.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   And when the--
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.040]   You know, at the same time, I turned on the themes.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   You know what the cute--
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   I love the themes.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   Yeah, themes.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.560]   You know, I mean, intellectually, I know it probably
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.080]   still tends to modicum.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.280]   But--
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   I get the mountain theme.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   You know why I turned off chat?
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.760]   Because every time I showed my screen on the show,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   somebody would say, hey, you're hot.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.960]   Or something like that.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.040]   You know, it pops up.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.440]   On there, you have no privacy.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.280]   So I turned off the chat.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.160]   Actually, it looks like it's on right now.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.720]   Yeah, I mean, the other-- a couple weeks ago,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.280]   they launched the Gmail redesign.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.600]   And it's got tasks.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.560]   The task link, you know, right at the top there,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.240]   like above the compose mail link.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.720]   And tasks at this point, you know,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.760]   while it makes me happy that, you know, I felt like, oh,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.440]   this is a little bit more of a commitment to the task product.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.800]   First of all, when you click it, it's just kind of a small little
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.040]   window overlay that shows up in the bottom right hand corner.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   And it's not the most mature Google product.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.480]   It's actually--
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   It's kind of weird.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.320]   And I like it.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:02.960]   It's kind of weak.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.720]   It seems strange that tasks showed up so high, you know,
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.120]   on the top left corner from user interface perspective.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.400]   I was like, this is strange.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.520]   And then I just felt like, oh, god, I
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.560]   hope that Gmail is not going to become just the dashboard
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.920]   for everything Google.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.440]   Because Google just wants to put their product in there
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.880]   and see because they know it'll get a ton of users instantly.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.720]   But what did you guys think of the new compose button up there?
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.000]   I like that because I never could figure out
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.800]   how the hell to start a message.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.400]   I'm sure it's built into Gina's--
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.040]   You have a few just user type of key.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.540]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.680]   But see, it's not in my DNA because I don't use it all the time.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.640]   So the fact that you've got a nice big button right there,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.280]   that's easy for me.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.780]   OK.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.480]   By the way, Nick has just sent me a note
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.800]   that he has a phone call.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.160]   So I'm thinking I could maybe call him.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   So how would I do that from Gmail?
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.320]   How do I call somebody?
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.920]   I just--
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.080]   So you've got to have chat on.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.160]   If it's available to you, it'll be right underneath the chat
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.520]   thing.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.160]   Oh, I see.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.760]   So the apparently is not because I'm looking at my chat window
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.880]   and I don't see anything there.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.560]   Yeah, I don't have it either.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.160]   Leo, little compose tip.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.240]   If you hit Shift, if you hold on to Shift key
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.400]   and click Compose it, it pops the little window.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.440]   It'll compose--
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:16.960]   Pop up a window.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   It pops up.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   Yeah, pops up.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.680]   Shift works for almost everything too.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.040]   Wow, everything you think it would.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.000]   That's nice.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Oh, really?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.080]   We just decided to move to Google Apps Premier Twitch.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.720]   So we're going to use Gmail for our Twitch.tv corporate mail.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.240]   And how's that working for you?
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.360]   Well, I don't know yet.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.600]   I can't figure the damn thing out.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.720]   It's a little beyond me.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.160]   But no, we had it all forwarding to my iMap server.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.520]   So now I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   But it's nice because we always use Google Docs here.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.600]   We always use for sharing stuff.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.680]   We use it like crazy.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.880]   And almost everybody here uses Gmail.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.400]   But Gmail for me was always like a second address.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.360]   I've always had this older address that I use.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   The Google Apps users are a little bit second class citizens.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.960]   Google Apps users don't always get the new--
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   There's no phones.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.720]   Yeah, but the buzz is there.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.000]   But this new phone calling doesn't roll out to Google Apps users yet.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.240]   So you have to just be prepared to kind of have
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.120]   to wait a little bit to get the new Gmail.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.840]   Remember, with the apps for your domain
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.760]   comes certain service level guarantees
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   that we have to be ready for the business customers.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.880]   So because a lot of people pay for that.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.000]   So we're paying $50 a seat a year, which is not bad.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.040]   Which is, it's money.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:40.880]   But it's money.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.800]   And in return.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   And if we screw up our SLAs, we actually like,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.960]   we'll give you free days and free weeks or whatever.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.680]   It's-- we're pretty serious about it.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.720]   I mean, it's not that we're not serious about Gmail.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.280]   But in some ways, Gmail, we have a little bit more flexibility
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.120]   there if we screw up.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   I wish I could go on that.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.160]   So that's the main cause for the delays for apps users.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.560]   And also, some things businesses don't want.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.520]   So they probably don't want employees buzzing all the time.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.040]   Although I would imagine some businesses would use--
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   is there enterprise buzz?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.240]   And then in the--
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.560]   for the inside the company, it's just fantastic.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.040]   So I could have-- we could have a Twit private buzz.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.600]   Or do you have to run a server to do that?
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.280]   How does that work?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.080]   I guess--
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.200]   I would just turn it on for the enterprise customers
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.560]   when we're sure we can meet all the service level
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.360]   guarantees.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.920]   And then you can turn it on as an admin in your admin console.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.800]   But yeah, because we've been testing internally
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.320]   for some time before we deployed it out in the public.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.520]   And we're just enamored with it internally.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.680]   Although it can be a bit of a time-laced draft to admit.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.440]   But I think--
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.960]   I'm not a fan of IM.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.760]   Like, Gina, I turn it off.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.160]   Because it's an intrusive thing.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.680]   But a buzz would be kind of--
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.960]   it's like a static IM.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.840]   Or like a--
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.280]   I think it would be perfect.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.240]   It's almost like a thing where you have a message.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.160]   And you're sending electronically to many people--
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.320]   Oh, like email, you mean.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.520]   But it's more--
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.480]   No, it's more interesting.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.640]   It's like a bulletin board system.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.200]   It's like an old-style bulletin board system.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.680]   That's right.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.720]   It's cool.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.440]   Well, I'm happy.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.120]   And I'll let you know how it goes with the Google Docs.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   Because--
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.080]   I mean, the Google Apps.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.480]   Well--
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.800]   Yeah, I think it's going to go well.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.360]   I think one thing that really helped
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.560]   is the ability to sign in to multiple accounts on Google.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   Yes.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.560]   Hugely helpful.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.320]   Yeah, because now I'm signing a book.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.680]   Yeah, that's not done for all the apps yet.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.080]   But it's getting there.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.880]   So big improve.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.280]   So we're all in agreement that it makes perfect sense
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.480]   for Google to make phone calls from Gmail.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.840]   OK, I'm happy about that.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.400]   A meal tweeted something like, great,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.160]   they're going to couple the misery of a full inbox
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.120]   with the whole--
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.360]   Oh, twice-man inbox.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.680]   Back to having a deal with a phone ringing.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   Like, phone calls and email overload.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.080]   Whoo-hoo.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.640]   Let's go team.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.560]   I have to admit that in some ways,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.680]   my little tantrum was not just about social media,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.600]   but just about overloading in general.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.320]   It's like, everybody's talking at me.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.240]   I can't hear a word.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.800]   They're saying.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.600]   And yeah, it was just too much stuff.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.000]   It's time for an unsubscribe party, Leo.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.840]   I did that.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.800]   And you know what I've done?
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   You know what I did for a while?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.440]   I was unsubscribing from a person I was following
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.880]   for every ex-followers I was kidding on Twitter.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.240]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.480]   No, it was a terrible idea.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   Didn't work.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.880]   No, it didn't make any sense.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.040]   And I'm like, really?
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.880]   Is this why I'm going to unsubscribe to somebody?
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.800]   I really like that.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.440]   I really want to use even following through to 30 people.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   I can't keep up.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.240]   Right.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.640]   I like the 150 rule.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.600]   Paul Adams of presentation about social networks
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   said that basically you really can't know more than 150 people.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   I think 150 people is probably a good rule of thumb
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   and good the outline.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.000]   And did you see-- you saw the comic about me, Joy of Tech,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.480]   the comic about-- did you see that?
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.080]   Yeah, I did.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.800]   It's funny.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.640]   I couldn't believe it's Joy of Tech was still running.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   They've been around forever.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.800]   Oh, 90 seconds, nag year old friends.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.400]   I've had it.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.360]   This social media is just narcissistic crap.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.080]   Everything I posted for years has been an immense waste of time.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.760]   I'm quitting.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.520]   And I bet no one will even notice.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   Poof.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.960]   Who are you?
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.680]   I'm Clarence, an angel.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.040]   Wow.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.840]   Are you going to show me how dark a dream the net would be
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.280]   without my comments and tweets?
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.720]   That social media is not a shallow cesspool devoid of meaning
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.040]   and that I do make a difference?
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.120]   And when I change my mind and start microblogging again,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.120]   you'll get your wings?
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.600]   No, I'm here to find out why you're not following me on Twitter.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.560]   I think that said it all right there.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.960]   You know, Colbert had a pretty great social media rant this week.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.640]   I linked it in the friend feed.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.000]   It was actually more about privacy than overload.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.400]   But it was pretty funny.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.480]   He quoted Schmidt, actually, that quote about how people--
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.400]   That's fantastic.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.880]   That's a game.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.440]   Yeah, boy, you must be so proud.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.440]   When Eric walks down the hall, the people go, right on Eric.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.200]   I try to keep it philosophical with Eric.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.520]   I mean, also because he's the super boss.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.880]   But I try to think, you know what, if I was this high profile
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.200]   of Tim, I mean, I think of some of the things I say.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.040]   People would be like, "Backback" at Chris's.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.800]   Great.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:12.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.600]   Oh, that's really true.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.240]   You wouldn't-- yeah, exactly.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.840]   Everybody's watching your every word.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.440]   It's almost hard to-- there's no way.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.920]   Yeah, like that first one, it was like, I don't know,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.560]   like six months ago, he was talking about the Patriot Act.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.760]   And he said something along the lines of,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.880]   if you're the kind of person who worries about the Patriot
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.120]   Act, you should watch what you say and you should watch what
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.920]   you do.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.840]   And everyone's like, "Watch what you say and watch what you do."
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.320]   And it's like, well, no, if you're--
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.440]   Never mind.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.040]   Forget I said anything.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.080]   You know, and yeah.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.520]   And then I guess the thing recently was the--
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.560]   I believe whimsically said that people
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.760]   should be able to change their name or whatever
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.440]   as they get older to sort of leave their old life behind--
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.600]   I think that's true.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.120]   You know?
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.920]   I think kids are seniors in high school are doing that.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.400]   Really?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:56.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.240]   My daughter told me this.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.280]   She said, "Yeah, what we do is we
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.400]   change our Facebook account to be something--"
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.240]   So, you know, people believe their Facebook accounts.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.080]   So, you know, I don't know if you remember this,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.720]   like a couple of years ago, is they would graduate from MySpace
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.520]   into Facebook.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.080]   Right.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.400]   You know, for college or whatever.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.120]   And now people are like-- and then they go from Facebook
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.040]   to nothing, I guess.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:14.560]   Right.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.920]   Well, I'm back on Facebook.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.040]   And I'm going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.960]   I'm shamed.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.400]   I'm shamed.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.320]   I'm glad Jeff's not here.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.080]   Why are you shamed?
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.160]   I can't believe you're back on Facebook, Leo.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.800]   After all that, I want to hear more about that.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.280]   I have a good rationalization.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.240]   And "Gird Your Loynes, Mr. Gebona."
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.000]   OK.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.400]   Because I want to talk-- the real reason we got you on--
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.240]   it's a little bit old news now, but I would like to hear your
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.280]   take on it-- is Google Verizon.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.040]   And when we had that conversation, you actually texted me or
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.320]   tweeted or something and said, hey, I'd like to come on.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.160]   We were in the middle of the show, so we couldn't get you on.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.040]   So that's why you're ostensibly--
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.000]   Well, honestly, it's probably good that I didn't come on.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Because by the time I tweeted that, I'd actually finally
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.760]   gotten the story and I finally got the information.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.200]   But I was still kind of--
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Hang on.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.040]   Well, good.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.000]   Well, give me a chance to lose your job.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yes, I'm--
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.800]   right after this word from carbonite.com.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.480]   You might want to know about this, Chris.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.720]   You could back up all your data before you lose your job,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.080]   actually.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.920]   Probably a good idea.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   That would be very handy.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.680]   Carbonite is a great solution.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.800]   I'm a big carbonite fan.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.760]   In fact, when we said Abby to put carbonite on the laptop,
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.560]   because inevitably, either the laptop gets stolen, the hard
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.360]   drive dies.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.520]   Probably the most likely, she accidentally deletes a paper.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.200]   It happened to my wife, which just right before her master's
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.400]   thesis was due, she accidentally--
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.800]   first time she'd ever used a computer.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.680]   This was some years ago.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.760]   Drag the file somehow.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.520]   Got dragged to the trash can and lost forever.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.680]   She had to rewrite the whole thing.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.320]   That's not going to happen to Abby, because I'm using
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.600]   carbonite.com.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.440]   Mac or PC, you could try it right now for 15 days.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.080]   If you go to carbonite.com and use the offer code twig,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.920]   you don't need a credit card, no obligation.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.560]   The software goes on your computer, Mac or PC.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.440]   And whenever you're online, whenever your system's not
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.680]   doing anything else, it'll be backing up encrypted using
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.240]   128 SSL AES-256 if you want to add further encryption
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.080]   for absolute privacy.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.960]   Now here's the beauty part.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.640]   Actually, there's several.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.960]   One, it's automatic.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.920]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.320]   Two, it's backing up to the internet.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.600]   So even if the worst happens, your backups are always safe.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.480]   Three, unlimited backup for less than $55 a year.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.040]   That means every personal file on your internal drive, on
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.760]   your laptop or on your desktop is safe.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   You don't pay tiered prices.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.160]   It's just one flat fee.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.400]   So you don't have to worry about how much you're backing up.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.920]   And finally, you don't have to have your computer to get
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   your data back.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.640]   To me, the important thing about a backup is you shouldn't
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   have to install special software or do some special
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.880]   Voodoo to get that backup.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.560]   With carbonite, there's a free iPhone app, free Blackberry
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.720]   app, or you just log on to your carbonite account from any
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.760]   computer.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.600]   And there's your data.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.320]   There's your paper.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.760]   So if Abby loses her laptop, she's in the middle of a thesis.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.240]   She goes to the library, logs onto the account.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.760]   There's her file, complete intact, backed up.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.120]   This is how backup ought to be.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.080]   It's a no brainer.

[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.040]   So Chris, this was a few weeks ago, the Google-- and
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.320]   everybody knows I don't need to rehash this, but Google
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.280]   and Verizon jointly made a proposal in effect to
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.520]   Congress saying, we ought to think there ought to be net
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.960]   neutrality for landline for existing internet.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.760]   But when it comes to mobile, maybe they ought to be able
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.480]   to do whatever they want because it's a nascent technology.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.960]   There's lots of technical issues.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.360]   We articulated a hands off sort of thing.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.000]   Hands off means do what you want.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.800]   And a couple of days later, there was a Google blog post
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.200]   that said, look, we understand it's not ideal.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.640]   We felt it's the best we could get.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.800]   And I believe that that's true what they wrote.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.760]   And I don't know if in the blog post I'm pretty sure they
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.360]   did what I talked about the rules around the 700 megahertz
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.160]   span for LTE. When we were bidding for that, we were
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.640]   pretty adamant about, listen, we don't mind losing.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.160]   But if we lose, we have to lose to people who have to
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.800]   confirm that they're going to support network
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.080]   neutrality rules.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.120]   And so I think we sort of passed on it.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.000]   We said, you know what?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.880]   We can get a deal for this proposal done for the
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.240]   wireline stuff, which is very important.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   I mean, it's not like Verizon doesn't have a horse in that
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:37.600]   race.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.760]   I mean, they all know absolutely.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   I think they own 51% of the Fios stuff that's under the
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.560]   Verizon name and Florida and a lot of the country.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.000]   So I mean, they have a horse that they have skin in that
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:49.640]   game, right?
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.320]   So it's sort of not--
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.000]   it's not just a soft for some wireless company.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.840]   So you say, oh, yeah, for our wireline stuff that we have
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.080]   none of, we're cool with it.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.120]   So I think that we really wanted that.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.680]   And I think that we said, listen, Verizon right now probably
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.480]   has the best network in the United States for data.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.760]   If you're not like international traveler, it's pretty
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.640]   much the ideal one for you.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.880]   And if you coupled out with the rules around 700 megahertz,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.960]   it's not really the end of the world if we just have an
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.840]   hands-off policy and say, let the market decide.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.800]   And in return, by saying that, we were able to get this
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.440]   pretty nice promise around wireline.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.040]   I think that that was a compromise a lot of people
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.440]   didn't like them.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.240]   Now, you're not speaking for Google, I take it.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.560]   Well, I mean, I'm not right.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.320]   I mean, you wouldn't have me on if I wasn't working at
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:35.560]   Google.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:35.960]   I mean, you might--
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.720]   Of course we would, Chris.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.560]   But you are working for Google.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.040]   And you're a fairly high-level manager at Google.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.840]   So I don't want to put you in a position.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.800]   I'm sure to the couple.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.920]   Google, for me, I mean, Google pays my bills.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.560]   They pay my rent.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.280]   They pay my salary.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:00.080]   I mean, I also know you as a strong advocate of open source.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.040]   That's your job.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.160]   I know you as a strong advocate of net neutrality.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.840]   You said, you kind of hinted, you were real thrilled at
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.080]   first when you read about it.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.720]   I wasn't very thrilled at first.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:17.080]   And I wish the wireless stuff had been a bit stronger on
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.120]   the net neutrality side.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.720]   But I really like the wire line stuff.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.600]   And there's another thing about this that a lot of people
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.680]   didn't notice is we've sort of changed slightly where we
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.280]   said, listen, we feel the network neutrality is not about
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   opening the pipe to all protocols at the same level
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.840]   of priority.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.680]   We said that, for instance, suppose you have a video
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.480]   product like your Hulu or your YouTube or something.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.320]   We felt that it would be unfair for one to be prioritized
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.760]   or over another within the protocol space.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.800]   But at the same time, some protocols, like voice, for
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.920]   instance, need priority over less important protocols.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.960]   So email, for instance, SMTP, it's
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.600]   storing forward.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.120]   It doesn't need sub millisecond quality of service.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.000]   It can be a little delayed.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.080]   So we've tried to articulate that our net neutrality takes
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.440]   that into account, our position that our net neutrality
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.640]   takes that into account.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.440]   And I think that that was something that got lost in the
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:12.960]   mix, too.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.000]   But I'm going off on a tangent a bit, though.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.480]   What about people who say there's an effect a triple
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.880]   tiered internet now created?
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.520]   The one landlining net that's free and open, and then the
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.160]   second kind of pay-per-view internet where certain
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.360]   technologies over mobile, like Verizon's VCAST, you pay,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.680]   you have to pay for.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:37.040]   And then finally, this kind of third internet where the
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   guy--
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.760]   anything goes.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.520]   If you decide I don't like Skype, you just say, well, you
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.960]   can't use Skype.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.440]   Well, it's funny because--
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.520]   so I've had machines in colos for some time.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.320]   And it becomes very, very clear that there's already a
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.360]   lot of different kinds of priority on the internet.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   Right?
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.080]   You know, unless you're an extremely large provider, and
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.720]   everyone basically has to peer with you so the traffic can
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   flow.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:12.240]   There's really no such thing as neutrality of protocol if
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.680]   I find a fine point on it.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.560]   So because people are always going to prioritize, for
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.440]   instance, voice traffic over BitTorrent.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.560]   They're always going to prioritize YouTube and web
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.880]   traffic over--
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.240]   I don't know, pick your favorite other protocols.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.360]   Even DNS is probably a lower priority than a lot of the
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.880]   voice stuff out there.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.160]   So it's like, depending on which port you're using and
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.560]   what protocol you're using can change.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.800]   And then you have things like VCAST, which are a little
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.560]   unusual, right?
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.800]   Because they're saying, listen, you're basically by being
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.440]   on this network, you're going to be able to get this VCAST
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.040]   stuff.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.800]   And I don't even know how VCAST is sent off.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.040]   Is it a multicast?
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   Is it a broadcast?
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.880]   Or it may not even be used in the internet?
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.480]   Because once you start interacting, the spectrum, right?
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.680]   Which is much more restricted from a bandwidth
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.160]   perspective.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.400]   It's not like Wireline, where you can just buy more and lay
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.720]   it down, as if that's easy to dig a ditch across the country.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.600]   But it's one of those things where some of the
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.400]   luxuries you get used to with plugging in a wire in the back
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.040]   of your machine go away.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.200]   Because all kinds of things affect it, whether it's the
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.480]   shape of the land, the frequency you're using.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.120]   If you have really thick drywall or maybe you have a
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.920]   laugh in plaster.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.120]   I mean, and so you have all these really weird questions.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   You can't blame--
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.480]   You're probably not saving trial.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.240]   --for lack of net neutrality.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.360]   No, no, no.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.800]   You know, we're mixing a lot of things together when we talk
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.440]   about network neutrality and especially network
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   neutrality and wire.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.600]   But you know what people are talking about.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.080]   What they're saying is we don't want--
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   They want us to plan a flag on wire.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.720]   Well, you did.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.360]   But that's the thing.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.120]   Google did.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:40.600]   He just did.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:46.960]   For years in every form, including this spectrum auction,
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.040]   fought the good fight.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.520]   And I think a lot of people, Jeff Jarvis, myself, Gina,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.320]   included, felt a little let down that Google, it looked like,
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.480]   was waving the flag, the white flag of surrender.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.760]   Well, I think surrender's a strong word.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   But no, I didn't--
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.840]   Sort of emperor, he or a hino, but it didn't help.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.800]   Well, we're not Czechoslovakia.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.640]   Well, we're not France or whatever.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.120]   I don't know.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.480]   Whatever your horrible--
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.520]   OK, but yeah, it's a terrible analogy.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.480]   But you're saying that the fight's not over.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.160]   And this is a point that is made, I think,
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.800]   sent several places by Google, which is--
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.200]   I would like to--
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.640]   This is a temporary solution.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.240]   Yes.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.360]   I would like to think that it's not--
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.400]   it doesn't have to be a fight with Verizon.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.320]   So that's what I would like to think.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.560]   I would like to think that what'll happen is maybe they'll
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   see what goes on in Wireline and say, you know what?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.960]   If we adopt similar rules on Wireless,
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.760]   I think we'll be well-served.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.640]   And I think that sometimes Google will go down the road
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.880]   with someone to help them--
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.320]   that sounds paternal-- that we'll
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.840]   try to see if things work out like that.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.360]   So if we're taking the hit for it--
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.800]   You know?
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.400]   Because people are going to say, well, Verizon's never
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.680]   going to be good.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.040]   And so there's no point in doing this.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.080]   But I think it's OK.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.440]   Verizon's-- the other side of this, I should point out,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.680]   Verizon's been a very, very good partner to Google.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.240]   I mean, they ship a lot of--
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.520]   That was the speculation is that maybe Google was paying more
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.680]   attention to its pocketbook than its principles.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.760]   Well, I think it's another way of thinking about this,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.080]   is that we're also giving our friends a chance.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.280]   So we have a big pocketbook.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.680]   I think about the term our friends
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.560]   is what people are a little upset about.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.760]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.600]   It's like they say that.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.280]   But if you look at the customer service reviews of Verizon,
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.480]   they're like the highest in the telco among the telcos.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.880]   I'm a Verizon customer either.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.960]   They're the most popular--
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.960]   --you know, telco may not be--
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.000]   The most popular kind of heart attack to have.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.840]   But you know, I mean, it says something.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.840]   You know?
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.680]   God.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.040]   It sounds like you're saying it's-- look, politics
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.320]   is the art of compromise.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.440]   And it's always very frustrating for the idealist.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.520]   And I won't include myself.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.640]   I know Gina and Jeff feel that way too.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.440]   We're idealists to acknowledge and admit--
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.640]   And I think that's important.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.120]   You know, I think that you shouldn't
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.480]   have to make excuses for your idealism.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.760]   So you know, you shouldn't expect more from us.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.400]   You shouldn't expect less.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.240]   And that's why I was personally probably pretty upset
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.920]   a couple weeks ago.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.960]   But you know, compromise is going to make
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   idealism feel pretty bad.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.720]   Or idealism makes compromise feel pretty bad.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.120]   And we've always been a company that's
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.000]   tried to hang on to our idealism.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.480]   So yeah, I get that.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.720]   I get the disappointment.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.480]   And I don't think it's wrong to be disappointed sometimes.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.720]   And what I hope is that we're proven to be right.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.400]   And if we're wrong, we just admit it and move on and fix it.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.640]   Well, you know, in some ways, I feel
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.360]   that this is what happened with China.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.000]   See, I'm going to touch all the things.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And if I'm not working here tomorrow, you know what?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.240]   But it's like, you know, sometimes our compromises
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.400]   work out.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.040]   And sometimes they don't.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.800]   So China was an example where it seemed like, from the outside,
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.000]   there was an internal rift at Google.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.840]   There was a group that wanted to be in China
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.880]   and maybe compromised ideals a little bit
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.320]   because it was important to be in China.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   And then there was a group that said,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.160]   now we should never compromise.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.800]   And the names that got associated with the former,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.880]   of course, Eric Schmidt and the latter with Larry Page.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.640]   But let's not say names.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.000]   But it's complicated.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.320]   Is there-- would you say within Google itself,
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.960]   as you walk down the halls, that this discussion is also
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.240]   ongoing, that there is--
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.680]   so I would actually personalize it.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.400]   Because China was an example of, again,
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.840]   I know people in China.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.560]   And they would tell me, listen, when
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.880]   it came time to search the web, and not the Chinese web,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.480]   but the web at large, Google was the place they would go.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.840]   And it's how they would find things out.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.120]   It's how they would learn, especially computer scientists
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.200]   I talked to, which is mostly who I talked to.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.680]   And it's like, they really appreciated that they do that.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.720]   And that made the compromise, which at the time
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.800]   was the weird pseudo-censorship regime.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.840]   It made it be kind of OK.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.080]   It's like, listen, Google's not a government.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.880]   Google isn't-- we're not president of the internet.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.560]   As much as people will seem to think, yeah.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   No, I am, actually.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.680]   That's you.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.280]   And duly elected on Twitter.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:15.920]   Dually elected.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:16.680]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.200]   King.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   King of the internet.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   No, no, just president.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.560]   Actually, I think my term is run.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.040]   I don't know.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.640]   And then he's all majesty.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.520]   Yeah, Emperor would be.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.440]   So I always have two minds.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.680]   It's like, on one side, it's like, we should give them
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.160]   the same results we give everybody else.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.360]   And then you get on this thing where it's like, I work for Google,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.440]   so I'm going to make mental compromises that maybe I
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.360]   wouldn't make if I weren't here.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.720]   Or am I being an electually true to myself?
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.800]   And it's very, very hard to know sometimes.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.400]   So I always have many minds on the China thing.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.040]   I'm pretty happy with where we are right now,
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.640]   with the Hong Kong solution, as it were.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.200]   I think it's a good one for us.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.000]   I think it's a little more true to our nature.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.240]   So good.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   And that might be an example of how this stuff can work.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.160]   It's even quick Google when we did the China thing.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.560]   And it wasn't a financial decision, really, by that time.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.720]   So it's like, I obviously am OK with this.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.440]   And in some ways, I have to personalize it.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.640]   Because I can't speak for every single human being at Google.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.880]   Much less, like I said, you're getting Eric.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.480]   Because that would be ill-advised.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.640]   Well, I really appreciate your frankness, Chris.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.360]   And it's really-- it's engineers like Chris,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.320]   who have this conscience.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.400]   And you can tell these conversations happen at Google
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.720]   and that the self-examination goes on.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.000]   I don't think that the evil conversation is just a story.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.960]   I think it really goes on.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.480]   And I'm not--
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.280]   So I really appreciate you being so frank.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.200]   And it's good to know that you had second thoughts.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.040]   And of course, they're your employers.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.240]   And that is an important fact.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.000]   But I do appreciate your--
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.040]   I mean, at the same time, I've got to tell you,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.320]   I've got this loyalty thing.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.960]   Or it's like, you know what, Google's been really good to me.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.240]   So sometimes when I get upset about some decision
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.960]   or some policy, I say to myself, you know what?
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.360]   One, I don't have to like everything.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.200]   But two, these people have been very good to me.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.280]   Why should I assume that I'm right about this?
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.600]   And I should not give them a second chance.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.360]   So I've got that weird loyalty thing going on.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.760]   And so I don't know that I'm always
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.280]   the best person to speak about this to an idealist audience.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.440]   Who are going to say, listen, you're just button sold by Google.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.240]   It's like, no, I'm actually loyal to Google.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.160]   Which is an unfashionable thing to be nowadays
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.520]   to be loyal to a company.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.440]   But I feel that Google's been very, very loyal to me
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.360]   and very good to me.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.520]   So I'm very emotional about it.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.800]   So it's, you know, I mean, I really
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.600]   love working at Google.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.120]   And I don't want to work at places that
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.480]   don't have idealism inherent in the system as it were.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.920]   And that's why I stay here.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.320]   You know?
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.520]   And it's why I want to come on to Twig and talk about it.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.080]   You know, listen, it's like, you know,
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.040]   when I saw the Verizon thing, at first I was like, wow,
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.200]   are we abandoning this thing that--
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.120]   you know, frankly, we were the only ones fighting for it.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.120]   Right.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.800]   For like five years, you know?
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.840]   Are we abandoning it?
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.880]   And I was pissed off.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.840]   And I thought, well, wait a second.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.880]   Let's just stop for a second.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.160]   One, there's no point in being pissed off.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.960]   But secondly, it's like, are we really
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.160]   going to throw away five years of work?
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.160]   And if our changing our minds, how are we changing it?
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.840]   Why are we changing it?
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   And if it doesn't work out, are we
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.760]   going to be the same company?
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.360]   I think we are.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.680]   And say, well, you know, I didn't work out.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.280]   Let's push this other direction later.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.520]   And that's why I sort of see it as being a compromise.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.160]   And one that I think that is what I hope will turn out
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.680]   to be good for the internet, for you guys, for Google, for me.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.600]   So there you go.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.680]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.360]   I echo Gina's remarks.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.440]   It's good to--
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.120]   and you said the word engineer, Gina.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.360]   And that's what I love engineers, because you know what?
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.960]   Engineers are very binary.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.760]   I did a little bit of coding recently.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.280]   But I've been doing a lot of coding.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.000]   You got the engineering in your brain, though.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.360]   Yeah, I think you've earned that title, Chris.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.760]   I think you're there.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.240]   Now, having said that--
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.760]   There you go.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:05.040]   Having said that, I do notice this article about Tom Talk.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:05.760]   Tom Talk.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.640]   Just Tom Talk.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.600]   Who is of Verizon spokesman.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.040]   Really, the Verizon spokesperson name is Tom Talk.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.560]   Tom Talk.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.760]   T-A-U-K.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.600]   You might be talking.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.000]   But I think you should call him some talk.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Search.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.360]   How are you?
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.800]   The wireless rules, says Mr. Talk, caused a bit of controversy.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.640]   Of course, we indicated that transparency
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.800]   should apply to wireless.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.080]   But we acknowledged wireless is different for a variety of reasons.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.040]   He quotes physics.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.720]   And that's true.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.320]   There are some differences.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.760]   He said, really, the future in wireless is with managed services.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.080]   He basically said there is no such-- the wireless internet
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.160]   is not the internet.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.920]   It's just a combination of managed services.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.080]   So that's why, I think, in the long run,
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.600]   I hope you will keep watching Verizon closely.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.000]   Keep your--
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.920]   Well, I mean, it's funny because if you have a bad idea--
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.600]   If I were to put, what does managed service mean?
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.480]   Because voice isn't TCP/IP on these phones.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:01.960]   Right?
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.600]   Is it?
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.120]   I mean--
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   No.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.240]   If it is, you want to be on a side line.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.120]   Because you don't want to be slowed down
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.320]   by your downloading of some mail on the side.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.960]   You're doing a conversation, obviously.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.560]   So it's like, what does that mean?
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.880]   So it's a question of, do we all mean the same things
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.520]   when we talk about this stuff?
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.840]   And we're all using different vocabulary.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.320]   And I have to tell you, telcos have their whole other vocabulary
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.560]   for everything.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.800]   Words you think being one thing really means something else
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   and they have for 40 years.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.760]   Good article.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.160]   I recommend in the Law and Disorder column on Ours
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.680]   Technica today a good article about--
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.000]   I like Ours Technica a lot.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.680]   That's great.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.720]   It's getting better and better.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.560]   It's become almost the Journal of Record for the tech
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   industry, if you ask me.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.400]   Well, they seem to know their--
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.600]   They've got good people.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.160]   Yeah, really good people.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.280]   So a couple of-- actually, as long as we got Chris on,
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.080]   maybe we should ask about Android.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.800]   One of the things--
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.480]   I love Android.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.720]   Oh, well, who doesn't?
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.360]   Everybody here loves Android.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:54.760]   I'm loving it.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.600]   Yay, open source.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.360]   Yay, open source.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.160]   But that's OK.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.600]   That's why I want to bring this up.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.100]   OK.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.400]   Android is open source, open handset alliance.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.680]   And in a way, that's caused Google to lose some control.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   And you have this really nasty situation where companies--
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:13.040]   we won't name names, Motorola, HTC, Samsung--
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.240]   are just kind of beaten up on Android,
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.920]   putting weird crap on it and so forth,
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.800]   and making it not a really great experience.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.720]   And this must be a little frustrating.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.080]   For Google, I know that's why you did the Nexus 1.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.640]   Yeah, well, I don't know.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.200]   I mean apps run on them.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   All the ones you mentioned have phones that are coming out
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.240]   that are 2, 1, and 2, 2.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:33.640]   And so the Amazon--
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.560]   I'm using Droid X, waiting for 2, 2, waiting, waiting.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:37.660]   Which is great.
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.540]   And I understand Motorola is suing people
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.440]   who put out an early ROM or--
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.440]   Oh, really?
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.940]   Well, they were mad because the 2, 2 ROM leaked.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:46.440]   Huh.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.720]   That's not good.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.820]   Yeah, obviously I have no idea what's going on there.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.320]   No, no.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.060]   So don't say anything.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.620]   I got to say Motorola's been really good about pushing
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.920]   out the updates, though.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.540]   I can't wait.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.420]   And Droid-- of course, Android 2 are both 2.2 now.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:02.060]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.700]   Yeah, I mean, what do you use, Chris?
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.380]   Are you still-- you're on the G1?
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.020]   Yeah, I've got a Nexus 1 over here in my bag.
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.300]   Every time I pick up my Nexus 1, I say, hey, little buddy.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.180]   You're still one of the--
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.340]   it's going to be a classic.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.100]   Like, consider--
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:18.600]   It is.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.740]   You'll look back on it and say this
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.100]   was one of the great phones of all time.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.860]   I think it's the developer's phone, right?
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.180]   It's the engineer phone.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.900]   You know, the pure Google experience phone.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.060]   But not just for developers.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.140]   It's pure for everybody.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.540]   While I'm using Droid X because I like the big screen,
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.420]   that's gorgeous.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.300]   I got to say, every time I pick up the Nexus 1,
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.860]   I'm thinking, I really should go back to this.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.220]   Because this is elegant.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.420]   Well, you know, I do a fair amount of international travel,
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.660]   so a Verizon phone kind of doesn't work out for me.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.500]   My sister has the Droid, as does my brother-in-law
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.140]   and my father.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.180]   And you know a lot of people.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.220]   So yeah, it's-- they're good phones.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.220]   Where were we going with this?
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:55.780]   I'm trying to--
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.620]   What are we just talking about?
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.740]   Is it a little source of frustration for the open source,
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.300]   folks?
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.980]   And I guess this is the duality of open source
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.100]   is that you do allow-- it does make it possible for people
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.860]   to change it.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.820]   What is the GPL, though?
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.900]   I mean, can you just use Android?
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.020]   Is it Apache?
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:13.820]   What is it?
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.100]   Put a picture of Android for you.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:18.700]   At the bottom is the kernel, and that's under the GPL,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.900]   which requires resharing of the code that you release.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.420]   And then on top of that is this huge Androidness, which
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.900]   is mostly Apache and BSD and a little bit LGPL.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.940]   So DALVIC and all this stuff above it are Apache.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.660]   It says you can have this, do what you want with it,
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.380]   and chip it.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.860]   And we can't tell you no.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.260]   And you don't have to release your code back out
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.460]   of the wild either.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:42.820]   You don't.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.340]   You just have to acknowledge that you got some of it from us.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.180]   That's the difference in GPL and Apache.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.900]   Well, it is.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.660]   But the funny thing about the GPL is that in the context
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.340]   of phones, if you use the GPL, the GPL Linux kernel,
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.820]   it's actually very, very easy to share that software.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:06.900]   And it hardly impacts you at all from a change standpoint.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.020]   You could still change the heck out of it.
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.500]   And then you just have to release your software along with it.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.020]   So because what you're really expressing frustration with,
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.340]   maybe, if it's frustrations, even the word,
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.620]   is that some androids don't look like all the androids,
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.980]   or some androids they add on the sense layer and sense
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.900]   you eye layer, or they have something else in there.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:30.740]   Or companies like Verizon end up locking down
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.940]   what was essentially an open hand.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.780]   And I don't remember which carrier was,
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.180]   but it was basically, you pay an extra $25 for tether.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:41.700]   Right.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.100]   That's Verizon.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.620]   So that's Verizon.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.940]   And so they put a little bit in there,
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.580]   and they turn it on and off.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.100]   And as a customer, you say, well, is that something I'm OK with?
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.460]   And people left me and said, decision.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.940]   Other people, they go out and they buy PDA net.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:59.980]   Other people, some phones are more locked down than others.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.500]   Some phones are not updated like others.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.100]   Either that's the other frustrating.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.540]   That's probably the most frustrating thing for me.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.540]   Not really if somebody has a different UI,
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.380]   or even if they charge extra for tethering,
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.860]   which from a bandwidth allocation perspective might be fair,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.540]   depending on your perspective.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.820]   Yeah, actually I don't have a problem with them charging for tethering.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.780]   I've made it possible to be way more when somebody ships 1.6.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.340]   OK.
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.580]   That's what really bugs me.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.180]   Because we're finally clearing all the 1.6s out of the pipeline.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.500]   And we've got some--
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:30.980]   And 2.1 is-- it's easy to ship 2.1 as it is to ship 1.6.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.500]   Right.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:31.900]   You know?
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:32.900]   So--
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.700]   And just battle it.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.980]   I just wish they'd get 2.2 out.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:37.020]   And now Gingerbread on the road.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.340]   And the road map has now gone to H. Yes, honeycomb.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.020]   Honeycomb.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:41.900]   Honeycomb.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.100]   Honeycomb.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.500]   That's confirmed.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   Yay.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.340]   Oh, this.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:46.820]   Sorry, guys.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:49.020]   I think Chris just confirmed it.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.660]   Or some other thing that starts with H.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.060]   Something.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.900]   So all herbs and H.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.300]   A crawler.
[00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.700]   It looked like Gingerbread was really aimed at a tablet, a larger form for it.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.900]   So I have to tell you, you know what I wanted to call Frojo?
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.500]   Because we were batting around names.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.700]   I wanted to call it Fran Japan.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.100]   But nobody had heard of it before.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.700]   That would have been great.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.380]   Like, it's great.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.420]   And they're like, nobody can spell it.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.700]   And I'm like, yeah, but it's really tasty.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.900]   And I'm like, what's a good--
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.900]   Well, it's like an almond paste croissant.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.500]   And they're like, just get out of the office.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.180]   You should have taken everybody to Paris.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.500]   And you could have-- and then they would have--
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.100]   They would have--
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.900]   Yes, on my special teleporting desk.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.500]   I love these stories.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.900]   The stories behind the names.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.100]   I didn't know Chris was in the room when this all happened.
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:30.700]   I love that.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.500]   No, no, I wasn't.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.100]   There's not like a secret room that I get to go to.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.300]   It's just when I see those guys like, you should call it Fran Japan.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.900]   And they're like, Chris, we're Fran Japan.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.900]   We're Fran Japan.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.900]   No Fran Japan.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.500]   Go away.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.700]   So, but no, Gingerbread, Honeycomb.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.100]   What will be-- do we know anything about Honeycomb?
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.100]   I have no idea.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.900]   And if I did, I probably would have said too much
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.500]   if it's the name.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.700]   No, no, I said it.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.700]   Maybe you didn't-- maybe you know he did he say it?
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.700]   Yeah, I get it.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.900]   The story that I linked to is that there was a rumor
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.700]   that was called Honeycomb.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.300]   That was pretty much all we know about it, right?
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.700]   I think the word is that it'll be a minor update.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.700]   What the names have to do with pastry or dessert or something.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.700]   So, Honeycomb, so obvious that, of course, that would be your guess.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.700]   No, it's not obvious.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:09.700]   It's not obvious at all.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.700]   It's not obvious.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.700]   It's not like, hey, let's go out for some fro you
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   on a honeycomb.
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   You know, it's-- how about-- how about--
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.700]   Hummin-tushin.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700]   Hummin-tushin.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.700]   That would have been good.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.700]   That Turkish?
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.700]   Is that Turkish?
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   I crossed bonds.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   See, that would have been fun.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.700]   And I haven't had lunch yet where you're coming.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:33.700]   The other problem is we have to buy the sort of the whole mini golf, you know, things
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700]   that we have in front of building 44.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.700]   That's right.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.700]   You know, we've got the--
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.700]   You've got the-- the cupcake.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700]   Right.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.700]   And they're big.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   They're big, right?
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700]   They're-- they're-- they're fro you.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.700]   They didn't know, well, they're really big.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700]   And it's from a company that makes them for mini golf places.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.700]   Really?
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.700]   So, those are really-- mini golf.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   Wow.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700]   So, sort of--
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.700]   Do they have Honeycomb for mini golf?
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:52.700]   They have no idea what you--
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.700]   I could tell you one thing.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.700]   They're very creative people.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.700]   They sure don't have Frangipan.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.700]   I think that's where I would have broken down eventually.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.700]   They'd been like, "Frangipan."
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.700]   What's that?
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.700]   What's that?
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   What's that?
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.700]   What's that?
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.700]   What do you-- what do you want me to cross on here?
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.700]   We could make you a windmill, you know.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.700]   And we put some--
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.700]   Okay.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.700]   We want a windmill and call it a Frangipan.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:16.700]   Let's start a rumor, Gina, that Google is starting a mini golf course in front of building
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.700]   43, 42, whatever it is.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.700]   We can start.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   Let's couple other stories, then we're going to get to our tool in tip of the week.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   Tip of the week.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.700]   Tip of the week.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.700]   And if you want to do a number, Chris, we always do a number.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.700]   Jeff does a number.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.940]   If you wanted to go search for a number, please do.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.200]   I don't know what your tool is, Gina.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   A lot of these links are tools.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.700]   I'm giving my phone number.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700]   I don't--
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700]   No, no, no.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.700]   A number would be like, Google activates 200,000 handsets a day on Android.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.700]   Oh, oh, hand it away.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700]   That kind of thing, yep.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.700]   Well, I like this one.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.700]   You know, we're getting ready for the social network.
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:53.700]   The Mark Zuckerberg Facebook movie, which, by all accounts, is a very good--
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700]   I love the trailer.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.700]   Yeah, the trailer is great.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.700]   David Fincher, great--
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   I love the whole kids against the establishment thing going on there.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700]   Aaron Sorker, and a great writer.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.700]   Justin Timberlake.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   Justin Timberlake.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.700]   Is Sean Parker?
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.700]   I'm a J.T.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.700]   fan.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.700]   Can't go wrong.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700]   A great-- I don't know.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.700]   And a singer?
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.700]   I don't know.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   And I like the kid from Zombieland.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.700]   He's great.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.700]   He's a kid from Zombieland, right?
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.700]   As Zuck.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.700]   He'll be good.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:18.700]   We should just call him Zuck.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.700]   I don't even know the guy.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.700]   Why don't we call him Zuck, Mr. Zuckerberg?
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.700]   Zuck.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700]   And our friend Zuck, because he's 26.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.700]   That's why we call him Zuck.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.700]   So after 26 months, it was a while ago.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:32.700]   So apparently, the next movie, going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.700]   No, no, it's not going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.700]   It's going to be "Sig Freed and Why."
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   It'll be based on Ken Aleta's book, "Google."
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.700]   And I'm sure that Jeff is pretty mortified that it's not based on what would Google do.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.700]   It'll be the story of Sergey and Larry and the rise of Google.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.700]   I think that'll be pretty good.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.700]   Sure.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   I guess.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700]   I'm so boring.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.700]   It sounds like a documentary, really.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   The nice thing about Facebook is there's sex and drugs and rock and roll.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700]   I don't really see a whole lot of that with Larry and Sergey.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.700]   Yeah, we don't do any of that stuff here.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.700]   That's a bunch of engineers.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.700]   I feel like all these movies are about these total doors.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   Like in their dorm room, trying to figure out.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.700]   They should be typing the whole time.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.700]   Yeah, just typing the whole time.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.700]   If it were true to like, it would be.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.700]   Can you get me a Dr. Pepper?
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.700]   I need a die-coke.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   Why isn't that micro-kitchen closer?
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   I got a bag here!
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.700]   Pizza!
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.700]   Funyons!
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700]   I want funyons!
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.700]   Funyons!
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   Who?
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   But Cheeto do all over my life.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   Think about it.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.700]   If Citizen Kane was just a guy sitting in office yelling at his reporters.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.700]   That's true.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.700]   I don't know if you have this as a tool or not.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.700]   We talked about it on Net at night last night.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.700]   The fact that you now have 30 seconds.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.700]   Yes, that was my tip this week.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   But that's what it's all about.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   I won't say anything about it.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.700]   It's a secret.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.700]   I didn't give it away.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.700]   I didn't give it away.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.700]   I just said you now have 30 seconds.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700]   For what?
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.700]   So you're not going to mention the fact that now you have the ocean and
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.700]   Google Earth on Android.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.700]   That's kind of cool.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   It is kind of cool.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.700]   That's pretty neat update.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.700]   I haven't had chance to play with it yet.
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.700]   Have you?
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.700]   I have.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   Yes.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.700]   And now I presume they're going to add all the desktop features which means
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   the moon, the stars and all that.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.700]   Oh, I do hope so.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.700]   Well, we already have the Google sky as an app you can call.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.700]   Well, that's right.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.700]   Sky is already there.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   Sky is out.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   But yeah, it's my call to go.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.700]   So let's get a confirmation out of Krista Bona on this one.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   Oh, I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.700]   Real-time search results that update as you type.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.700]   Tech crunch sites.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.700]   Oh, yeah, I saw this.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   You know, we always test stuff out online.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   Does it mean it's going to happen?
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.700]   It's going to happen.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.700]   I mean, you know, so.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.700]   There's a time where you place everything like pictures of ponies.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.700]   No.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   Can I have it?
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.700]   Really?
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700]   No.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.700]   I've always liked Google's suggest.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.700]   I mean, that's really cool.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.700]   And it did.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.700]   It's also a fun game to play just to see, you know, when you type my name,
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.700]   what do you get?
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.700]   But, uh, Theo is really good looking.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700]   No, you don't get that.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   No.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.700]   If everyone searches for it, maybe we can make it out.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.700]   Theo, is it based on what people are searching for?
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.700]   I honestly don't know.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.700]   I think it must be a mix of things.
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.700]   It wouldn't just use trends data.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   I mean, am I, you know, but.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.700]   So now they're going to update the search page as you type.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:26.700]   Leo DiCaprio, Leo Laporte, iPad launch, Facebook, Twitter, Kincio, Tech Guy,
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.700]   Quits Facebook.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.700]   I feel like every episode of "Twig Devolves" in one of us googling ourselves.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   You should do Leo Laporte's space is space and see what happens.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700]   Deary.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.700]   Yes, you dare.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.700]   Oh, you are a man of is a douche and an idiot.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:41.700]   There you go.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.700]   Oh, really?
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.700]   That's not cool.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.700]   That's not nice.
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.700]   That's those are the two results.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.700]   You're neither of those things.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.700]   Now, why would somebody search for Leo Laporte is a douche?
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.700]   I don't think you'd need to search for it if you were confident about it.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.700]   Well, obviously they're not.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.700]   They're looking for confirmation in their beliefs.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.700]   Well, people always do that.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:02.020]   So it could just be a test.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.500]   It doesn't mean that they're going to have real time.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.700]   We test unusual things all the time.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:07.700]   It's kind of wave-like.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.700]   I feel like if they rolled this out, everyone would be like, "This is too chaotic.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.700]   Things are changing too fast on my screen and I cannot grok it."
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.700]   I know not to understand.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.700]   I don't understand why the words keep changing.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   Shit, still, damn you.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   I'm just going to take a look at the people in the back.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   Do you remember when we ran the tech man thing?
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700]   And there was all those tech support, like, trans-carcism.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.700]   Why is tech man in my Google?
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   Is that what they were saying?
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.700]   It's broken.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.700]   Why is they making sounds?
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.700]   And it's like, I feel kind of bad, you know?
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   It's like whenever you get trapped behind somebody who's really old driving and it can
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   be frustrating, but at the same time I'm like, "I would want somebody to be really patient
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   if I was the old guy."
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.700]   Because we're all going to be eventually.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   Right.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   And eventually I'll be that old guy.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.700]   Right.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.700]   And so I try to have a lot of sympathy for people.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.700]   So when I saw those Pac-Man tramps, I kind of felt that.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.700]   I mean, people are calling up saying, "Why is my computer making that sound?"
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.700]   It never did this before.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.700]   What is going on?
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   For like, was it the fact that you have to press a button that says "insert coin" kind
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:11.700]   of a hand?
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.700]   No, if you didn't do it, it would turn on by itself.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   So when we first pushed it out, it automatically started after a little while.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.700]   Oh.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.700]   Right.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   And so it started going, "What?"
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.700]   "What?"
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   And people were freaking out and they're like calling up their tech support because they didn't
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   know what their computer is doing.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700]   They thought they had like a virus or something.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.700]   And then it became, you know, and then of course all the mean people on the internet,
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.700]   they're like, "Oh, dumb users.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.700]   And it's like, no, they're just, you know, they're normal."
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:42.700]   It's something unusual and they want to either stop it or they don't know why it's going
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   on a little worried because the computers don't always perform so well, you know?
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.700]   We geeks forget.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.700]   We forget that there are normal people.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.700]   We're sensitive.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.700]   We should.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.700]   It's true.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.700]   No.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.860]   That's one of the reasons I do that and the huge paycheck, I continue to do the radio
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.860]   show.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.860]   The huge fish.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.860]   No.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:04.220]   The reason I do the radio show is because it really gets to eat me in touch with normal
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.460]   people who call in and say things like that.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.460]   I forget.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:11.700]   It's easy to forget if you don't constantly talk to normal users that our viewers--
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.700]   That someone would react with anything other than delight at the side of Pac-Man on their
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.700]   Google page.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   Right.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.700]   Exactly.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700]   What I'm gonna ask about this.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.980]   I think it was cool we did it and I really liked that.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:26.860]   Yeah, I think it's okay to be a little sympathetic, you know, when people get confused by computers
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.740]   because, you know, we all didn't-- we weren't born with keyboards and aren't-- well, I was,
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.900]   but most people were not born with keyboards in their apps.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   Good on you, Cristobona.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   You're absolutely right.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.900]   True.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900]   It's a good point.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.900]   K-ship Ken Sheperson, our director of engineering.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.900]   I wouldn't not ship Pac-Man though.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.900]   We make it very, very clear.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   Oh, no, you gotta do it.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.900]   Gotta ship it.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:42.900]   Gotta ship it.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   Gotta ship it.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.620]   Just, you know, bear up under the brunt of calls.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.620]   Yes.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:51.860]   Google does not have a tech support number though, does it?
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.180]   I think we do for enterprise, appster, domain customers.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.340]   Because you really wouldn't want to be answering calls.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.380]   My search doesn't work.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:04.220]   Yeah, where are these calls coming in anyway, Chris?
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   No, these were like local ISPs.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.380]   Oh, I see.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.380]   Okay.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.380]   Okay.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.380]   Gotcha.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.380]   Yeah, that's who gets the calls.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.380]   Google will not take.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.140]   All right, time to get our tech tool tip and number of the week.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:22.140]   If Chris wants to come up with a number he can, but let's start with our tech tip of
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.300]   the week with Gina Treput.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   I have a great number.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.300]   Oh, good.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   It's very narcissistic.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   I like it.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.580]   My tip this week is a Gmail tip.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:33.420]   One of the Gmail Labs features, which I absolutely love and been using for a long time, it's
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.180]   called Undo Send.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:39.740]   So when you, with it enabled, when you send an email, it will, a little, a little message
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.500]   appears across the top of your inbox.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.740]   It says, do you want to undo, undo this?
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.940]   You can call an email back.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.260]   It used to be that I think it gave you like five seconds in order to make that quick decision.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.500]   Undo Send just got a configurable amount of times.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.540]   You can set it up to 30 seconds.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:58.620]   You have up to 30 seconds to pull back that email where you forgot the attachment or realize
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:02.140]   that you were just too drunk and that was just too embarrassed thinking.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.380]   So to turn it on, you have to have Undo Send enabled in the Gmail Labs section, which is
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.380]   what Leo is looking at right now.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:13.180]   Apparently I have enabled every, they include a green robot and all sorts of weird ass
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.180]   crap.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.940]   All the, all the, a lot of labs features are really good, but then you have to go in a
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.660]   Gmail settings and there'll be a new setting which, which, where you can set, I think it's
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.180]   a dropdown of like five, 10, 20, 30 seconds.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.380]   So once I've enabled it, I have to now go to these settings.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.940]   And then go, and then go into settings, which is a little weird.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.900]   I would have expected the setting to be where you enable it, but so it's two different places,
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:39.540]   but turn it on and the first time you undo sending a message, you will be very grateful.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:40.540]   Yes.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.780]   Five, 10, 20 or 30 seconds.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.100]   You have 30 seconds to pull back that email.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.060]   And the reason it's not longer is because of course your mail doesn't go out for that
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.060]   period of time.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:52.140]   So if you made it 20 minutes, people would start calling Kristobona saying, where'd my
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   mail go?
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.700]   It's not going anywhere.
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.700]   It's stuck.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.660]   And that's how come make is it only 30 seconds?
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.660]   Only 30 seconds.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.980]   Because otherwise they'd be calling their ISPs.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.260]   My mail is constipated.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.980]   It's taking 20 minutes.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.700]   I don't understand it.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.620]   Kristobona, what is your narcissistic number of the week?
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.140]   Well, I have two.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:24.420]   So the number of additional Twitter followers that came from the live broadcast.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.140]   The fact that you even know what the Delta is is.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:30.340]   Well, I checked it, you know, before we got on.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.140]   It looks like I've gained about 40 followers.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.140]   Oh, we could do that.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.140]   I reload.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.100]   What is your Twitter handle?
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.100]   It's C to bonus.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.660]   You know, Twitter slash C to bonus.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:43.260]   Well, we'll get a little more than that here.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.260]   There he is.
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:45.260]   And I'm following you.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.260]   Oh, really?
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260]   That's it.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:51.020]   And he looks like Rasputin the Mad Monk, but don't let that disturb you.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   No, no.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.380]   If I let the Rasputin, I'd be like, it's skinnier.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.340]   Krista, is this your Google?
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.340]   Is this your Google headshot?
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.620]   It's a good shot.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.180]   It is absolutely a PR paid headshot.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.780]   And my second one, as I was going to say, and I thought that it'd be really fun to hear
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.340]   from you two from your main Gmail accounts, the answer to this.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:12.140]   So if you click on All Mail, and the upper right hand corner is the number of threads
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.140]   in your Gmail.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.140]   Ooh.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.140]   It's a very interesting number in my--
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.340]   So where do I go?
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.340]   So I'm in my mail.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.340]   I'm in my mail.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.340]   With an All Mail?
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   Okay.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.340]   Not in the box.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.340]   All mail.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.340]   Is that some--
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   All mail.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.340]   It's in your list of--
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.340]   Oh, way down on your-- okay.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.340]   All mail.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.780]   And now what am I looking for?
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.820]   And then look to the upper right hand corner.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.780]   It'll say one to 50 of X.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.980]   And what is X?
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   9,892.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.980]   What's yours, Gina?
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.780]   Well, this is on your new one, right?
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   Those are your apps for your main--
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.780]   No, no, this is my Gmail.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   Because I don't use it as my primary mail.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   Well, there you go.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.780]   I'm 26,307.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.780]   Wow.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.780]   Wow.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:53.780]   Wow.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.620]   Well, this is for my work email, not for my personal email.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.380]   And it's 259,926.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   Oh.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:05.780]   So that's my primary work email for 4.5.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   4 plus years.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.580]   Do you think it's more in your home or less?
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.580]   Oh, I could find out.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.380]   Yeah, another 10,000 by other accounts.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.380]   So like 42,000 for me.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.180]   I was-- I thought, wow, almost 10,000.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180]   If not, I'm really committed to--
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.180]   I'm really committed to bring up our spam folders.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.180]   Oh, I can show you a pair of spam.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.180]   I'm there for a 30-day moving average.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.180]   All right.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180]   Let's see.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.180]   Spam, I have 859.
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.180]   I only have 859.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.180]   I have 20,900.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:32.180]   I have 24 my Gmail.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180]   7,000, Gina?
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.580]   Yeah, I've got 7,800 in here.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.780]   Yeah, what do you have, Chris?
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.780]   Let's see.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:40.780]   I have to go to it.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:47.260]   So in my regular Gmail, I have 213,653 threads in my all mail.
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.980]   And then for spam, I have-- not many, actually.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.980]   This is not very many.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.980]   It's just 2076.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.580]   But it's going through a primary filter first.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.380]   It's a weird number.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.180]   So it's not so bad.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.180]   I feel I should have more spam.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.180]   I feel like--
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.180]   Yeah, me too.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   I feel like I'm selected by the spammers out there.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   Don't say that.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   Just the likes of you.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.340]   Well, I have-- you know, inadvertently, if you've watched the video, I've been giving
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.340]   out my Gmail address.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:15.500]   I mean, it's not like it's something you couldn't guess.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.100]   So I have the highest spam, but Chris had the highest number of threads.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.100]   Right.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.100]   Well, you know, when I'm in a class like Gmail, it's your--
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.100]   We could find it out.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   I don't know what's worse there.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.140]   I think I'd rather have the spam because I don't want to have all those conversations
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:31.140]   that I actually have to deal with.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.140]   What is that number?
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.140]   What is that threads number?
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.140]   That means how many different conversations--
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.340]   Not merely emails, but conversations.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.540]   Conversations, yeah.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:43.380]   So it's all the emails with the same subject are collated into one thread.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.380]   Right.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.780]   So you have many more emails than 200,000.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.180]   Yeah, probably a million.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.180]   Wow.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.980]   But I haven't read all.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   There's just no way.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.780]   See, I bought a lot of extra storage on Gmail.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.700]   I think I have 207 gig storage.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.700]   That's great.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.900]   Because for Picasso, I-- you know, the--
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   --is sharing.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.060]   And-- but I'll never fill that up.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.220]   I only have-- well, I have 4.6 gigs of email.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.460]   How many gigs of email do you have, Chris, if you have that many threads?
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.220]   On my work one, it's 15 and a half.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.220]   And then--
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.220]   That's my home one.
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.220]   It's not that many.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.220]   It's--
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.980]   Google probably gives you the 25 gigs that you get from Google Apps.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:20.980]   Premier.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.460]   I mean, you get 25 gigs for Premier.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460]   I have the same thing.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.460]   You have 25.6 gigs.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.460]   You know?
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.460]   So, yeah.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.620]   It's really kind of a multiple tip of the week is how I think I'm going to plan my new
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.540]   flow with Pub/Sub/Hubbub and all of that of a content.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.220]   So it's going to start as I did today.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:46.260]   I-- I blogged that we were doing the show at leoville.com.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.780]   So that's where-- that's where my blog lives.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:56.540]   And on leoville.com, if all goes well-- and there is a plugin for WordPress, which I have
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:02.180]   yet to install Pub/Sub/Hubbub plugin, which will then pump it to Buzz and then-- I use
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:07.420]   a program called Buzz Can't Tweet, which is-- people have sometimes complained is unreliable,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.780]   but I have found it to be quite reliable in taking my buzzes and putting them on Twitter.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:16.980]   I mean, the speed with which Buzz can tweet works depends a lot on, I think, Twitter and
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.660]   you know, how Twitter is responding.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.020]   But it seems to do quite a good job.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:25.940]   You sign in with your Twitter account using OAuth and it has quite a bit of control over
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.380]   what goes to Twitter and how it goes to Twitter.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.460]   You can even say, you know, just certain hashtags go to Twitter.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.740]   So that's kind of the publishing chain.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.740]   And then my real question was, because Buzz has this great widget.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.700]   And I really-- one of the reasons I buzz so much is because I have the widget on my
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:46.580]   Android phone so I could, you know, hit the widget, take a picture or post a picture or
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.980]   even just post a simple comment.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.740]   And that's one of the things that I think I'm going to kind of mostly miss.
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.460]   On my Android phone-- let me see your Gina, you're there.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:01.140]   So let me switch my camera five down to this so you can see my Android phone.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.340]   On my Android phone, I still have that Buzz, Post a Buzz widget, which I highly recommend.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:11.380]   But now I've found a WordPress, open source WordPress blog posting application that's
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.540]   free from the folks at Automatic.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.580]   And you can post directly from there.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.260]   You can even add media, photos and videos.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:25.660]   So I think while it took a few more clicks, I may be able to start everything-- this is
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:29.860]   my goal, to start everything on the blog.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:35.340]   And this WordPress app is available both on the Android phones and the iPhone and even
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.340]   the iPad.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:38.860]   There's a very nice version on the iPad.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:42.420]   If you're using WordPress.com, of course, it gives you lots more information.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.580]   If you're a Squarespace user, there's an iPhone app too.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.620]   So I would say most blogs probably have something like this.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.660]   I am also using, and I really recommend, although it's no longer free, commenting engine, there's
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.660]   two good ones, disqus.com I used for a long time.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.500]   Discuss is how that's pronounced.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.820]   Now I have to switch this back over.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:10.260]   Discuss is a system that takes comments out in the social sphere and brings them back into
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.260]   your blog.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.460]   But the one that I'm using right now is from JSKit.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.140]   It's called JSKit Echo.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:21.620]   It was, unfortunately, it was a buck a month, and now it is unfortunately $10 a month.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.900]   So they've recently raised the price.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:29.220]   But it's very easy to install, and I think it is really, really a powerful solution.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.100]   The nice thing about Echo is the comments are in real time.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.020]   They come in from social media.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.180]   They get aggregated.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.340]   You can reply.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.340]   It's very powerful.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:44.380]   And if you go to the comments section on Lee Oville.com, a really good example was this
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:52.540]   buzzkill post, which got a lot of engagement in the real world and got captured right back
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:53.540]   into the blog.
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.260]   Now, it's hosted, unfortunately, it's hosted by JSKit.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.620]   So I'll have to some way to import it back in.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.940]   Let me see if I can find the post.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.820]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:09.420]   Into my blog, if I want to save them, but at least for the time being there, they're
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.420]   safe.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.620]   And I use services like backupify.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:12.620]   But look at this.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.620]   What is the current count?
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.220]   I don't know how many comments there are on here.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.500]   And most of them from Twitter.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.940]   Yeah, 2,100 comments.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:25.220]   Well, that's the point, is that this is a way to get the Twitter engagement back into
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.940]   the blog, respond there.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:33.180]   Now, the responses don't automatically go back to Twitter, which is kind of not ideal.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:38.220]   But at least there's a way to get this engagement back into the blog.
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.940]   Because what I'm trying to do is kind of get the best of both worlds, which is post
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.620]   on the blog where it's permanent and saved, but have engagement in other places.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:51.420]   So cross post into Twitter and buzz and Facebook and then capture the conversation back from
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.580]   those social media sites.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.700]   So those are the tools that I'm using right now.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.300]   And there goes Krista Bonai, board him to tears.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:03.940]   Now, how does the, how does this plugin know that the response on Twitter is to that particular
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   tweet?
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.540]   It only works if it sees the link.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.780]   Oh, if it sees the link.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:11.020]   So the expanded link has to be to your, to the permalink on the page.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020]   That makes sense.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020]   That makes sense.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.020]   I believe so.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020]   But it's, but most people do that.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.020]   They do a reply to the original post.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.020]   Let's get Krista's calling back here.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:24.300]   There we go.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.700]   So, but I, now this is just a very preliminary set of ways to do this.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.420]   And I would, I would love to do is get some conversation going, maybe I'll, I know what
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.420]   I'll do.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.620]   I'll blog post about how I'm doing this and get some conversation coming back because
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.460]   I'd love to see other ways to do it.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.140]   Because the key for me is it has to be easy to get that original content out.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.500]   That's one of the reasons I use buzz in Twitter.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.380]   It's one of the reasons you do Gina.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   It's easy.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.940]   You go, but it, it, and it's done.
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.940]   Right.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:51.940]   So how do we get that kind of ease of publishing combined with permanence and engagement?
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.780]   That's my, my ultimate goal.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.900]   Gina Trapani does her thing.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.900]   She's still blogging.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.980]   If you were in Pennsylvania now, you'd have to pay that $300 blog or fee.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:02.980]   It's so weird.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:03.980]   Isn't that weird?
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:04.980]   Isn't that weird?
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.700]   They want to charge people to blog as like a business.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.420]   Underwear.org, that's the place because she's an enlightened San Diego.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   She doesn't have to do this.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.420]   Yes, yes I am.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.220]   She does not have to worry about that.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:19.360]   And of course her, I don't know, should I plug the book?
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.860]   If you know it's okay.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.900]   No, no, that's okay.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900]   We can plug the book.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   It's a history book.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:31.740]   It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's an homage to the way.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.620]   Oh, that's right.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.620]   That's terrible.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:40.980]   I enjoy it at completewaveguide.com because you know, it's, it'll be, it'll be in the
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:41.980]   computer history museums.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:42.980]   That's right.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.380]   There was this thing called wave.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:49.460]   It was the only manual ever written.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.060]   And let's plug this new fast company thing you're doing.
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.060]   Can we plug that?
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.060]   Oh sure, that'd be great.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.260]   I'm doing a new video series on fastcompany.com.
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.300]   It will start airing in September and Leo is making a guest appearance, which I'm very
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.660]   excited about.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.460]   And I'll, I'll add the link once they start airing.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.100]   It's a cool kind of fun Q and A.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.940]   It's like having Kirk show up on TNG.
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.940]   I don't know where I am.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.940]   Good.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.940]   That's going to be fun.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:15.940]   Fastcompany.com.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.940]   Look for that.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.940]   Mr.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.460]   Kristobona is always welcome here in the Twit cottage.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:25.420]   We just, we just adore Chris and he's, he's currently doing this Google thing, but you
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.860]   know, who knows what will happen tomorrow.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.940]   Open source program manager at Google for open source.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:34.260]   And don't forget that if you want to come to our government 2.0 broadcast on Friday
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.940]   at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:37.940]   Can you email me about that?
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:38.940]   I'll send you all that information.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.340]   Tim, Tim O'Reilly will be here and a whole bunch of people will be talking about transparency
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.340]   and open government.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.220]   You're invited to Gina because I don't know that I have the street card for that yet.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:48.940]   I think that we're just really getting started in a lot of ways.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.020]   Well, see the Google's got to be a big ass back.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.140]   You know, I'll mention it.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.340]   And follow him on Twitter, CDIBONA.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:01.540]   I'm a Geno Vese, a couple of Sicilians.
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.540]   What are you going to do?
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.540]   Let's go have pasta.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.540]   We'll see you next time on this weekend.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.540]   Thanks everyone.
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   Bye guys.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.540]   Thank you.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.540]   Bye.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.540]   Bye.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.540]   Thank you.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.540]   Thanks again.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.540]   Thank you Gina.
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.540]   See you later.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.540]   Take care.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.540]   Did you say goodbye Chinese people?
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.540]   I think you did.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.540]   Oh, he thinks in chatroom people.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:30.540]   [ Music ]
