[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   Isn't that a good one?
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   Yeah, because it's usually Queen of Cloud.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   No.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   I have tea, but Waffles.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   Queen of Clotted Cream.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.700]   That's not bad either, is it?
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700]   Yeah, and like, keep going.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.700]   The Queen of Strawberry, Jam, and Donuts, and Waffles.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   Joining us now to my left, the Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation at...
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   The Cray.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   Newmark!
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   Careful, is it okay?
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   Is it clear?
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City of New York.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700]   He did not appear this time.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700]   Hello.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   And I am LFA of Taco Bell.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   Yes.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   Are you still?
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   Are you still?
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   I had the new Taco Bell Chicken sandwich or is it a taco.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   Spicy with jalapeno slices.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   Very good.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   Very disgusting.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   No.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   Stacey, what are we going to do about this guy?
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   No.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.700]   It's just the little cousin of the Popeye sandwich.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.700]   It's not up to the Popeye standards, but it's a nice little treat.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   It's not very big.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   It's good.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.700]   You go to Taco Bell for terribly cheap Mexican food.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   Be, cheese, beans.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   You don't come for cheese.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   Normally, my order is two bean burritos.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.700]   I had, of course, I had to try this because I am.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   Was it good?
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   Yes.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.700]   He says it was good.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   What's it called?
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   The chicken sandwich?
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700]   The chicken taco.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   There's a debate, is it?
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   That's a good thing.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   That's a good thing.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.700]   The chicken sandwich taco.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   Oh, you're right.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.700]   It is a taco.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   It's actually kind of a bready.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   Yeah, that doesn't look like a taco.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   It looks like a pita or a fatouche or something.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   And if you're in the spicy one.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   What's this stuff dripping at the end though?
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   That's special sauce.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   Everybody's got to have a special sauce.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   Is that gross?
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.700]   It's fast food without a special sauce.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.700]   Did Miss Ashley leave?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.700]   I think we might be.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.700]   I've chased her out.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700]   Yeah, let's start the timer over.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   And that is Mr. Ant-Proit.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.700]   He is the arbiter here of all things Taco Bell.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.700]   And right back to cheese and cheese.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   And fat.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   And fat.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   And fat.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   And air of clothes.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.700]   Yes.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   What's this about ironing?
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   Last week he made fun.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   I was giving him some grief about that jacket he was wearing.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   It was a little rumple.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   Yeah, a little rumple.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   Great.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   He wanted to steam me.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700]   Great.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   Top stories are so many.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   I don't know where to start.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   Proton Mail says, well, maybe we do log your IP address actually.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.380]   Proton Mail is one of a number of companies to nota another one that offers encrypted
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.380]   and encrypted email.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.380]   You know, it's cool.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.380]   It's good.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:22.380]   I think it's important to understand the limitations of encrypted email because you can't, you
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.260]   know, the other person has to, you have to kind of have a agreement.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.300]   If you're both using Proton Mail, no problem.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.500]   But what if you're sending a Gmail?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.060]   Well then either it's unencrypted or you have to send them a link to something that
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.420]   an encrypted blob that they have to figure out on unencrypted.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.900]   And that what is not encrypted of course is metadata who you're emailing.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.940]   And so that means Proton Mail has information about what you're up to.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.340]   And on their website they said, we don't log your IP address.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.060]   However, they had to respond to a legal request from the Swiss police to hand over a user's
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.820]   IP address and details of the devices he used to access his mailbox resulting in the arrest
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.780]   of this, of a French climate activist.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.940]   We don't know what the crime he committed was yet.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.860]   A alleged crime.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.340]   Proton Mail says, well, we have to respond to a lawful request.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.980]   Well yeah, but you shouldn't have boasted that you don't log IP addresses because obviously
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.980]   you do.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.980]   And it affects that.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.980]   Was that one of the marketing?
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980]   Yeah, it was marketing.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.980]   And that line has now been removed from the website.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.420]   We mocked when Steve Gibson was talking about Proton Mail.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.900]   He mocked them a little bit because they on their website made a big deal about how the
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.460]   fact that their servers were buried deep within a Swiss mountain as if that somehow magically
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.860]   protected your data.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.740]   I think there's a lot of marketing that goes on in this stuff.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.140]   Well, the email is beyond marketing.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.420]   Beyond marketing was it mentioned in their terms of service.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.180]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.620]   Unfortunately, we don't.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.420]   Because I'm sure it's been updated by now.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.260]   It's all been changed.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.300]   Anyway, I don't think this is I don't really want to hammer Proton Mail.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.380]   They should not have said that.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.220]   They still say the email is still encrypted.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   Yeah, you know, so is PGP.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.220]   That's fine.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.100]   I don't know if they supported perfect forwarding encryption or not.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.380]   That would be an important thing.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.460]   But apparently the user information logging was happened.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.020]   And that's kind of the point when you're using email, metadata is visible.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.460]   No matter whether the message is encrypted or not.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.500]   So and metadata is often apparently was all the police.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   These police wanted.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:55.060]   They didn't they just want to know who this guy was emailing, I guess.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:01.340]   I guess we got nothing to say.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.340]   I know.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:08.780]   I'm just I was thinking about this and I'm like, well, you know, yeah.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.820]   The only it's like you shouldn't lie to people.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.820]   OK, next story.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.060]   Yeah, yeah, kind of that's it.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.060]   Especially if you this is unfortunately you get ready because this is you know, as people
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.500]   become more and more privacy focused expect to be conned more and more over privacy issues.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.260]   You know, when you announce to the world as we have that we care about something, then
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.780]   there are going to be plenty of people who come after you saying, Hey, look, we've got
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.820]   what you want.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.580]   And like the freedom phone.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.580]   It isn't.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.780]   Yeah, I mean, this is the smartphone for conservatives.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:54.380]   It's turns out to be a low end China phone made in China by Chinese people.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.980]   The same thing, you know, you're opening yourself up to people who are a little bit
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.540]   less a little bit more cynical about life and then to podcast ridicule.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.540]   Yes.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.940]   And then to podcast ridicule, which of course is the lowest form of ridicule is our specialty.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.500]   If you're being really, I mean, these people don't know anything.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.860]   They're just going to make fun of you.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.860]   Exactly.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.500]   You're not even eloquently.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   Thank you.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   Hot waffles, hot takes.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   We got them both.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   Yep.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   I know.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.180]   I'll try to find a better story.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.180]   How about this one?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.060]   Well, with that said, though, what's the next step for folks wanting to manage their
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.060]   own email?
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.980]   Actually, this is a good concern.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.340]   That's a good point.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.300]   That's in fact why I brought this up.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.500]   It's really important to understand email is by its nature, not a secure messaging platform.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.660]   It never will be.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.620]   There are things you can do.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.220]   I would suggest instead of trusting somebody like proton mail or to tonight, I have accounts
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.980]   on both, but trusting them because they have the keys, it would be better for you to generate
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.220]   your own keys, use PGP mail and send them out that way.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.620]   But still who you're sending it to subject lines, a lot of the stuff is still visible.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.780]   Signal was never intended to be a private or secure method of communication.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:19.340]   If you really want to communicate privately, my strong suggestion is use signal.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.340]   Don't use WhatsApp.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.420]   Apparently, Facebook can see what you're doing on WhatsApp.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.740]   Well, with that said, I think I should probably read through the signal terms of service,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.580]   terms of service because who knows what their marketing is as being secure, but is it really?
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:42.860]   Signal is created by Moxie Marling Spike who is a strong privacy advocate with a long
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.060]   track record.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.100]   The source code is open source, which is very important to me.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.900]   I would never trust anything that was an open source.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.540]   Signal has been vetted by many, many people.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.100]   The source code has been vetted.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.860]   And I don't think there's any question that Signal is secure.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.820]   Now WhatsApp uses Signal.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.420]   This is the Signal encryption.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.860]   I think it's Telegram that I was confusing.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.620]   Telegram is not necessarily secure.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.580]   So that's why I said that.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:19.060]   It's why I didn't say use signal or use signal and the sentence.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.060]   Period.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.620]   Period.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.980]   And I think there is still truth that once you saw if I use Signal with you, Leo, my
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.460]   fate is still in your hands.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.340]   Because you can do anything you want with it.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   Sure.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.340]   You know it now.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.060]   What's called leaves your head.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.740]   You're never fully secure.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.700]   Email is I think any company that promises you secure email is over promising.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.980]   So don't just use if you and if so actually that's the question.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.500]   Let's say I wanted to tip off Stacey to you know a big scam that was going on in the
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.740]   IOT field.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.300]   And a lot of reporters maintain accounts so that you can message them.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   Do you Stacey do you have a do you publish a way that people can do?
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.860]   People could tip you off.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.340]   I don't publish my signal account.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.980]   I do mostly because I don't get a lot of secret tips that way.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.500]   My tips mostly because if you want to tip off a reporter, typically you have a relationship
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.580]   with that person.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.540]   So how do you engage the conversation?
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.780]   You go to a parking garage like Deep Throat did with Woodward and Bernstein.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.780]   I mean this is always a problem.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.220]   Actually I meet someone face to face.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.460]   And the other thing is I'm not reporting on national security things.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:39.700]   So my most difficult scoops are things that are maybe like the company would be mad that
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.260]   someone talked about it but it's not like it's not criminal.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.260]   It's not criminal.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.260]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.180]   So like if you work for Google and you wanted to tip me off, I would not bring my phone with
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   me.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.540]   A lot of newspapers.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.900]   Yeah, that would be smart.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:59.500]   A lot of newspapers, Washington Post uses something called secure drop which is, and
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.020]   they specifically published this saying, this is a discreet way for readers to share messages
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.340]   and materials with our journalists.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.340]   And there.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.580]   You get a lot of crap on those things though.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.540]   I mean, it's hard to, like I want tips from people I trust.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.620]   I know that sounds wrong.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.700]   But I mean, because you're going to have to vet anything and vetting something is hard.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.860]   But the Pentagon Papers for instance came in over the transom, right?
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.740]   And actually again, those were physically delivered to the Washington Post which is probably
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.980]   the safest way to do this.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.980]   But everybody wants to go.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   They didn't want to physically deliver them.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.180]   They actually wanted to keep them themselves.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   Right.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   Right.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.340]   It's interesting what the Post says.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.540]   If you want to securely message them with a tip, go to a place with a public internet
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.940]   connection, one that you don't normally frequent.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.940]   Listen to this.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.940]   This is what?
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.940]   This is opposite.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.940]   Listen.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.180]   Download and install the Tor browser bundle from Tor project.org.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:06.820]   Open the Tor browser and then copy in this address.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.620]   https colon slash slash Washington Post dot secure drop dot Tor dot onion.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.180]   From this URL, you'll be able to send messages and files to a secure drop box that we will
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.020]   check periodically.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.100]   You will be provided with a code name that you will use to log in to check for replies
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.380]   from the Post.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.900]   Keep the code name you're provided safe and secure.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.780]   We will not know your code name and you should not share with anyone.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.820]   If you forget your code name, we will have no other way to contact you.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.060]   It's like your Bitcoin wallet.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.060]   And this comes from the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.100]   Jeff, do you ever, do you cover this in your class room?
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:53.300]   We do actually in terms of primarily security for both the journalist and for the source.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.020]   So it's now required for everybody.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.420]   And you can see why the Post wouldn't want to know who you are because they don't want
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.540]   to be ordered to be revealed.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540]   Be subpoenaed.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.060]   The Post says no system is 100% secure even with these measures.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.180]   There might be a risk of someone discovering who you are or what you are sending.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:17.860]   And so they have in fact more steps to secure yourself, which is they say don't use an
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.780]   operating system that helps preserve your privacy and anonymity like Tails, which is
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.540]   a Linux distribution that's designed around security.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.540]   Delete trails of communication.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.460]   Honestly, go ahead.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.140]   Print it out and mail it.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.140]   I'm not kidding.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.700]   I mean, oh, oh, I hate to say it's Stacy, but I know print outs.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:44.740]   That's can be there's a there is a hidden dot pattern on all print outs that lead directly
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.420]   to your printer.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.580]   But so borrow Stacy's printer.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   Printer.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.180]   No, that's so printed out at the library.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.780]   Yeah, go to the library, print it out and then take your documents, drop them in the
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   bill.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.860]   But a journalist, we're aware of like, thanks to like the John McAfee, you know, metadata
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.220]   and the pictures, most journalists are now aware of things like the dot patterns on
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   printers.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.980]   So we won't publish the actual right documents, but those documents, you need to burn them
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.300]   because of the FBI comes in knocking.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.940]   They know how to read those dots.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.700]   Yeah, but we don't have to give that up.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.300]   You can just I mean, that's part of the freedom of the press or that's part of like
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   as a job.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.660]   Yeah, I think it's less of a problem in the US, but I think there are plenty of other
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.020]   places, including some fairly civilized places.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.620]   Yeah, okay, and other places you should burn them.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.740]   That would be better not to.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:46.140]   I'm starting to think Australia, England, Canada, probably not good places to try to
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.740]   evade police surveillance.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.140]   All right, enough of that.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.700]   But anyway, that's why Signal is a good choice, I think.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.220]   But hey, if you really want to get fancy, read that document from the Washington Post.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:05.820]   Do most newspapers use a similar service or do they do their own thing?
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.820]   It varies.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.780]   It was after Snowden, it was quite the rush to do it.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.820]   I think a lot of them built their own, but there are some services that are provided
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.220]   available in newspapers.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:24.660]   Yeah, so the New York Times says use Signal, and there's their Signal phone number.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.100]   They may want to retract this part.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.140]   What's app?
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.140]   What's app uses the Signal protocol?
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.100]   And by the way, there's a debate over this story.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.620]   This is actually an interesting story from ProPublic.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.900]   Yeah, it was like ProPublica.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.900]   ProPublica?
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.900]   Ah, cah.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.740]   I was wondering what that explosive explosive was from you.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.740]   Cah.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.700]   I was thinking it too, Jeff.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.860]   Okay.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.780]   The Ola Pore.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:05.300]   Now Facebook undermines the privacy of two billion WhatsApp users.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.020]   This came out yesterday.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.260]   What's app assures users that no one could see their messages, but the company has an
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.900]   extensive monitoring operation.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:19.060]   A thousand employees who can read those messages and regularly shares personal information
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060]   with prosecutors.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:33.460]   Facebook saying that ProPublica misunderstood the technology, so they're denying it.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:39.340]   But at this point, New York Times might want to take that off their tips page.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:47.620]   They do say you could send an email with PGP, and here's their PGP key.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.700]   They do point out metadata will be available to your email provider.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.060]   Oh, postal mail.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.500]   Mail delivered through the postal service is another secure means of communication.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.060]   Well, this is not a postcard.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.300]   You know, it's a federal offense to read the back of a postcard.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.820]   We recommend that you use a public mailbox, not a post office.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.820]   Tips.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.820]   Interesting.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.020]   And they also use a secure drop, which uses Tor.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.820]   So this is interesting.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:23.700]   The Times has a very extensive variety of ways you can give them a tip.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:30.180]   I still struggle with trusting security of regular mail or any of the courier services
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.020]   just because of how packages look when you get them.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.020]   I know.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.020]   I get destroyed.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.460]   They're opened and you know.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.460]   Really?
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:45.020]   I get the occasional destroyed package, but most of my packages come pretty intact.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   So now there's it's it's it's been a little while for me, but definitely last year during
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.140]   2020 when the lot of stuff was being shipped shipped here.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:03.740]   It was a lot of tape ripped off and holes cut into the sides and it is pretty common.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.740]   Wow.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.500]   Fortunately, nothing was damaged, but people were definitely interested.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.820]   Whether it was Amazon or or if they're good at it, they would use a teapot and steam it
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   open.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820]   You never know.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   Oh, so that's the truth.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.820]   You're talking about boxes.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.820]   No, this is for this is for boxes.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:29.660]   I mean, when I see this box soggy or I just team it up these like porch pirates or were
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.180]   these just postal workers who wanted to see you.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.500]   I think this is part of the news.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.140]   Yeah, I think this was part of the courier staff.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.700]   I think they just get grumbled up to sometimes just in the bouncing around pack of the truck.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.660]   You think you're trying to get into it?
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.900]   But you wouldn't have gotten it if they were, if they really wanted it, they would have
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   just taken it.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.540]   Yeah, that's what I say.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.460]   I'm assuming they were just interested in curious, but now it was about it.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.940]   They didn't steal it.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.180]   They're looking for graphics cards.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.900]   And if you don't have one, they're like, eh, I didn't, I didn't lose anything, nor did
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.340]   Queen Purr because she just shipped some things out and people would message her and say,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.900]   despots is destroyed and hits in pictures.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:17.540]   When I bought my nixie clock, I didn't realize it came from the Ukraine.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:23.460]   Remember that Jeff that long, boring process of installing tubes?
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.420]   It was driving you nuts.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.220]   And then you did the whole show with it behind your head flashing.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.580]   Yeah, that didn't work either.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:38.300]   I have it in my other office now, but I posted a picture of the box because it came from
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.620]   the Ukraine.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.620]   And see how it was great.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.060]   It was just cool wooden crate.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.140]   It said, for a G-lay on the side and everything.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.580]   But you see how it's taped?
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.780]   Because the customs opened it.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.780]   They opened it.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.580]   And so said, what the hell is this?
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.780]   Well, it's not a bomb.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.780]   Go ahead, Tony.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.780]   Let him have it.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.780]   Wow.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.900]   What are the two hands holding?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:08.580]   That means it was made in the great beyond, I think.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   It's like test containers.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.300]   Yeah, I think that's fragile.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   But it's a...
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   Or no.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   That's fragile.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   Oh, it takes two people to lift it.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   Fragile is wet.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.100]   Fragile is the broken wine glass.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.140]   The umbrella is make sure you take an umbrella with you when you go outside.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.140]   And that...
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   Don't get it wet.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   Don't get it wet.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.420]   And that means it takes two hands to lift it.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   That means it's magical and magnetic.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.820]   And after you get the vaccine and you're very dedicated, you can float that in the air.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.820]   It's really cool.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.820]   I almost...
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.420]   I really wanted to just keep this box because it was just so cool to get something to create
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   like that.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.340]   And who was the same person who told you not to?
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.340]   You said don't get it.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.860]   We know who she was.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.340]   Yeah, I can.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.340]   Not to keep the box.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.940]   Oh, no, I didn't keep the box.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.940]   German police.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.460]   Guess who else uses Pegasus?
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.420]   We talked last week about Bahrain.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.820]   Apparently, the German police also use Pegasus.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.500]   This is the spyware that lets them hack into your iPhone without your knowledge, without
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.780]   your in, you know, in any clicking on your part.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.780]   They bought Pegasus...
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.180]   This is the NSO Group one software?
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.100]   They bought Pegasus from the NSO Group in 2019.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.540]   The federal government informed the Interior Committee of the Bundestag of the purchase in
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.940]   a closed-door session.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.700]   Apparently, there was a little bit cracked.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.180]   The Parliament sources said the confirmed earlier reports published in the German newspaper
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.660]   they say were confirmed.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:36.180]   The software was procured under the utmost secrecy, according to...
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.180]   Is it Desight?
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.180]   Desight?
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.180]   Easeite!
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.180]   Daseite!
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.180]   At sea...
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.180]   To...
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:52.720]   Let's fight the hesitations of lawyers as the surveillance-tool can do much more than
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.180]   German privacy permits.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.760]   However, the version, purchased by the German Federal Criminal Police Office, had certain
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:08.260]   functions blocked to prevent abuse.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.960]   They're only allowed to use spyware on cell phones and computers of surveillance targets
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.760]   in special cases and can only initiate certain types of operations.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   Well, I feel much better now.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.080]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.200]   We will come back and talk about the new, touchless whole food stores opening up in a
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.680]   neighborhood near you.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   It's fragile.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.680]   This is it.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.600]   It's a special, a special award.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.240]   And I put it in the window.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.640]   For those of you who are only listening, there is the famous leg lamp from a Christmas story.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.720]   Our show today brought to you by Command Line Heroes.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.680]   They're back Season 8.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.120]   I can't believe it.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.840]   And I'm really excited about it.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.000]   Their host is great.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.040]   Saran Yitbarik.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.080]   She really knows her stuff and she's got Command Line Heroes.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.720]   All of the seasons tell the epic tales of developers, programmers, hackers, geeks, and
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.920]   open source revels who are revolutionizing the technology landscape.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.160]   This season, the whole season is about one question and they tackle it from every angle.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.360]   What is a robot?
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.720]   The episode one, which just came out is robot as servant.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   Really interesting.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.080]   But there's also going to be robot as a software, as maker, as humanoid.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.080]   Why do we build robots that look like us that answer that question?
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.680]   And even though we always ask whether we can trust robots, what about robots?
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.280]   Can they trust us?
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.960]   Robot as vehicle, robot as body, robot as threat.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   Of course, robots have always been the meat for science fiction stories, but now they're
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.600]   becoming a reality.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.360]   In the near future, I think robots are going to be there to serve our every need.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.880]   Will they develop a mind of their own?
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.280]   Will they turn against us?
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.920]   Will they be the savior of humanity?
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.080]   Or will they be our downfall?
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   Season 8 of Command Line Heroes covers the robots that are in our midst and the determined
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.480]   dreamers who bring them to life eight episodes in this season eight.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   Let me play.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.080]   Let me play just a little clip.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.280]   Seran and robot as servant.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   Listen.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:36.360]   While making the season, we discovered a robot reality that's pretty removed from the robots
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   we imagined.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:45.200]   And yet, all those misguided ideas about what a robot should be actually shaped with robots
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   are.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.120]   And no robot fiction shaped things more than the story we told ourselves about robotic
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   servants.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.360]   Seran Yebarrak is great and her show is great.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   Season 8 is out now.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.960]   Search for Command Line Heroes.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.120]   You'll find it on Apple Podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts will also include a
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.760]   link in our show notes so you can just go right to it.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.680]   Thanks so much to Command Line Heroes for their support.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   You should listen.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.920]   Command Line Heroes from Red Hat.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.320]   Thank you, Red Hat.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.800]   Let's see.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.600]   It's kind of a potpourri today.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.560]   Apple Foods is going to be getting the Amazon Just Walk Out technology.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.880]   First two stores will be in California and Washington, D.C. in the Glover Park neighborhood
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.680]   of Washington, D.C. in Sherman Oaks, California.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.400]   This is the store where you go, your grab and you go.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.320]   Did you try it Stacey and Seattle?
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.360]   Yeah, but this is actually bigger.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.960]   So it's the same technology.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.360]   It's a whole food.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.520]   It's applied over.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.720]   Imagine how many cameras you need and how do you count how many bananas you got?
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.920]   Imagine the computational workload that's happening behind the scenes because, I mean,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.600]   how many people in a grocery store at any given time, like 200?
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:12.160]   So when you get to the whole foods, you'll scan the app or insert a credit card linked
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.240]   to your Amazon account or, and this is very controversial, place your palm over a palm
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.480]   scanning system called Amazon One.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.360]   Oh yeah, I remember when that came out.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   Right.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.720]   So but you could also just scan the app.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.200]   You need to identify yourself somehow.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.960]   I think probably safer to use, you know, the phones.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.160]   I use the app and it's it's totally fine.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.040]   Although it is annoying to have like 18 different Amazon apps on my phone.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   True.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.440]   If you opt out of the cashierless technology, there aren't any cashiers.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.520]   You'll have to use self check out or go over to a customer service booth.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.960]   Yeah, it's really an interesting idea to put this in a normal sized whole foods.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.920]   Well, it's also like, I wonder about the communication with like, so you can't just turn this on
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.640]   because people who are used to that being their grocery store who aren't like tech people,
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.560]   are they going to just walk in and be like, what the heck?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   So what's the question?
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.840]   Yeah, can I shop here?
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   Well, if you're more than one person shopping at a time, well, what knows that you the person
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.680]   picked that up off the shelf and put the cart.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.320]   Well, one of my wife and I are both shopping.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.120]   Not that that happens because she thinks I'm a disaster at a grocery store, but just theoretically,
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.280]   or your kid grabs a bottle of candy.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.040]   What makes somebody a disaster in a grocery store?
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   I'm a disaster.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.640]   I'm not allowed to go to the grocery store.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   What?
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   Yeah, I'm not either.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   What do you guys do?
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   I feel like there's a similar rule in place here in the prue.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   You two all three of you.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   So what do you say?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   I got to have Froot Loops.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   I got to have Froot Loops.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Mommy, mommy, give me Froot Loops.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.160]   No, it's I don't know where everything is.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.240]   Why isn't the catch up next to the tomatoes?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   It's not logic.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   It's not.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   I can't remember why it is.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   That's not for long.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.440]   Okay, Jeff, your reason is silly.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   Oh, that's cringy.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   Okay.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   My reason is I cannot be expensive.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.440]   Mine is expensive cheeses.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   Yes.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Your fruits and day.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   I'm just like, oh, rice pudding?
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   I don't mind if I just--
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:15.240]   Oh, lucky because my wife encourages me to buy expenses cheeses and rice pudding.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   That's the thing.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.320]   I will go and I will buy the more expensive stuff here and there, but I don't send the
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   rest of the family because they're wasteful.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.840]   They'll buy a lot of stuff.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   Oh, you're the one who won't let them go.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   Right.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.240]   I'm the one that manages the grocery run.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.400]   And poor niece, she's getting a raft of that now because she wants to know.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   I'm like, oh, I'm going to shop.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.080]   And at the floor down, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's wasteful.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   You just--
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   Yeah, your eyes are hungry.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.640]   Oh, oh, oh, you're kind of the grocery store.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.280]   Scrooge, Scrooge.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.440]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   El commandante.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   I just don't like waste.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   See, you're the reason I'm not allowed to go to the grocery store anymore.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   That's the deal.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   And he always like, you can't.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   Is that why?
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   Mm.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.440]   Yeah, he's--
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   I love--
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   I feel--
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.400]   You know, the other day, I was in a safe way.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.000]   And I don't normally go to the safe way.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I usually go to smaller artisanal stores.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Of course not.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You're going to smaller artisanal.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I'm especially not allowed to go to the grocery store.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I'm not allowed to go to the grocery store.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   I love the grocery store.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I love the grocery store.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Yeah, I love the living market.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.120]   So I prefer to go to them and say, but I went to the safe way.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.560]   And I was-- I felt like a Soviet citizen coming to America for this first time.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.920]   I was-- I was gobsmacked.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   I was at all.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.720]   And I was looking around and saying, look at all the vegetables.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.400]   And oh my god, look at all this.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.280]   And I really hit me that we live, at least some of us, are very fortunate to live in
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   the land of plenty.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   True.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   Wow, so--
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   True.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.400]   It's really interesting because with COVID, there's food shortages in most of our grocery
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.680]   stores now in certain areas like certain types of pasta or like this week we couldn't
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   find any kind of--
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   Oh, I hate it.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   And for a while.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.440]   You can't get Buka-Tini to save your life.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   Well, no.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.640]   I mean, I'm with you, but I think it's a real wake up call for a lot of us to be like going
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   through and being like my husband is like, Stacy, look, your groceries, your recipes
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.360]   are too complicated now.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.480]   Not all this stuff is in the grocery store anymore.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.720]   So he's having-- and since I do most of the cooking, he's like, I don't know what substitutes
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   work.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.280]   So it's really interesting to feel like the plenty is leaving.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   From Grub Street.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:37.800]   What the whole is going on, the very real totally bizarre Buka-Tini shortage of 2020.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.240]   That was an amazing story.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.760]   And I actually was affected because I love Buka-Tini.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.440]   I love Buka-Tini.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.200]   Did we ever find out why they actually went to the National Pasta Association?
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.000]   Oh, it's a great story.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:01.460]   It's all about how an unnamed pasta giant got it, like, taddled on another unnamed pasta
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.640]   giant about the amount of flour or something in there--
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.360]   Is that in trouble with the FDA?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   That's right.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.800]   So it wasn't officially pasta or something I can't remember.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.520]   But the broad scope of it is they taddled to the regulators.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   And the regulator said, until you can change your recipe, you can't be classified as pasta
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   in the US.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.840]   So that took out a whole honkaboo katini.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840]   Wow.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   So what are you calling this?
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   That was part of it.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   That wasn't all of it.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   But it was a great story.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:35.200]   Apparently, the US found iron levels in Dacheco Buka-Tini lacking by 2.1 milligrams.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   Yes.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.800]   And Dacheco is the best pasta you know.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   It's great pasta.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   It's the best.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   Great.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   It's Italian.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.200]   So is like, barilla, barilla, barilla.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.960]   Barilla is very, very good too.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.400]   Although at the artisanal store, I usually buy fresh and meatballs.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   But they don't make buka-tini.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.560]   Anyway, I don't know why that was a rat hole.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.480]   Meanwhile, what happens if a couple walks into just walk out?
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.320]   Yeah, I wish they would open one near me because like when I, my daughter and I go,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.800]   we do occasionally get to go.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   But I, we split up.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.680]   I'll be like, okay, get these three things.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   Go.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   And then, you know.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.440]   How do you sell things by the couch?
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.240]   Because the camera knows, does the camera judge how big it is?
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   They do have weights.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   They do have weights.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.040]   Oh, there's humans behind the counter still weighing stuff out and labeling it and so forth.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.480]   In fact, Amazon was quick to say these locations will employ a comparable number of team members
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.120]   as existing whole food markets and stores of similar sizes.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.760]   With just walk out enabled whole food market stores, how team members in the store spend
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.960]   their time is simply shifting, allowing them to spend even more time.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.200]   It's right on you.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.040]   With customers.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.200]   No, honey.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.840]   No, no, you can't come in here.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.200]   Buy anything.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.400]   Where's your smartphone, dear?
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.280]   No, you have to have a smartphone.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.080]   Well, you could put your palm on this, but do you have an Amazon account?
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.720]   You can't come in with that an Amazon account.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   Stuff like that.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   It's true.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.520]   I mean, I send my kid in for.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.280]   I send your kid in and then what?
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.840]   Well, I'll, you know, because we are walking distance between it to a Safeway.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.640]   So now when she's like, oh, I forgot to tell you, but I need this for my recipe tomorrow
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.920]   morning, you know, I'm like, you got to eat.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.920]   He's in Safeway.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   He's in Safeway.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   Amazing place.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   Full food.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.360]   Every aisle is food.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.560]   It's amazing.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.960]   I think their produce is lacking.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   Well, you know what?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:45.880]   Maybe your Safeway was that way, but I was actually surprised at the produce at the Safeway
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:52.440]   in Petaloma, but they're competing with, you know, artisanal produce coming coming from
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:59.800]   Texas where we had H.E.B. in like these massive, like super H.E.B.s or super targets or like
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.880]   massive grocery stores coming up here in like urban grocery stores was a real change.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   I was like, yeah, there are only like five.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.280]   Like a lot of pasta on the show.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.560]   You live on an island.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.240]   You're cut off from the main house.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.560]   How much do you need on that diagram?
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.560]   That wasn't my point.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   Boopettini, yes.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.520]   Boopettini, baby.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.280]   We have two grocery stores on the island.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   It's a big island.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.640]   And then we have, it's a big island.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.200]   We have 24,000 people.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   25,000 people now.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.760]   That island where I'm moving doesn't have anything.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.800]   You have a pond in some fields.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.600]   And on Hat Island.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.120]   But I'm with Mr. Jarvis though with regarding like stuff that you have to weigh considering
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.720]   how much meat that we buy here.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.600]   How is that going to be handled when it's based on buying a pound?
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.000]   And if it's just somebody back there, measure it out and they put the label on it to be
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   scanned.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.320]   And what if I happen to have that label inside my hand accidentally as I'm walking out and
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.920]   there's no camera to concede and right.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   How well how well?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.720]   At the at the Amazon stores that exist, it's so heavily packaged that if you reach for a
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.000]   tuna sandwich, knows where the tuna sandwich is, all the tuna sandwiches are the same.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   That's seen to be a problem.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It's a mistake.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Doesn't it?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   I don't get it.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I mean, they'll figure it out.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It has must have a barcode on it right here.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   QR code.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.360]   It's pre weighed and they'll probably weigh the floor where you're standing and see how
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   much weight you're paying.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.560]   No, actually, I do think there are sensors in the containers.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.360]   There are sensors on the shelves.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.920]   I think I said there are sensors on the scales.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   That didn't make sense.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.720]   There are scales on the sensors.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   Which are attached scales.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.000]   Basically, it's one giant thermo mix.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.720]   Well, fortunately, if I go to the grocery store, I've got a little bit of ten times.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.840]   Yeah, the only thing I could figure out to make with a thermo mix, but I make it a lot
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.000]   is mashed potatoes and risotto.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   But it's really good for mashed potatoes and risotto.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   You look up stuff.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   It has recipes.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   So you said it's wasted on you.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   No.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.360]   You described a cookie do, by the way, my subscription is running out, which is weird
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   because you buy a $1,500 appliance.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.160]   You wouldn't think you'd have to spend 30 bucks a month on a subscription to anything.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.000]   Oh, it's $30.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.240]   I don't remember what cookie do is, but it's something like that.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.680]   It's not cheap.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   Maybe it's not.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   Maybe it is.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.680]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.280]   But you think you read these recipes, you know, they say things like, you know, I don't
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.520]   know, Italian island burgers or something.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.720]   And most of it's cooked outside the thermo mix.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:35.160]   So it's not like I don't, you know, thermo mix is good for sauces.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.240]   Well, like here's a thermo mix recipe.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.640]   Grilled try tip with cream spinach.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   Mm.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   You had, yeah, but most of it's made on a grill.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   You know, you know, I guess the cream that goes in the spin, I guess I could make the
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.440]   cream spinach in it.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.280]   That's about it.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.400]   So I don't even know why they mentioned the try tip.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   You know.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.640]   I just don't understand it.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.000]   Anyway, I wonder that we said about marketing.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.320]   Yeah, I fell for it.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.120]   Let me see cookie do membership.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.760]   You could tell they're not, they're from not from around here.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.240]   They call it cookie do $39 a year.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   It's not that expensive.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.920]   I overstayed it's not bad.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   That's not bad.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.720]   Um, I want to talk about zoom dysmorphia.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   Okay.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   Yes.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.520]   And what side?
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.040]   It's a mental health issue.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.400]   Well, so says the guardian.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.240]   It is in the fashion section.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.560]   But that just means, okay.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.920]   So here the issue is we're looking at our faces all the time and we're like, huh, my
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.320]   face looks weird.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.200]   Because we're all on zoom looking at ourselves all the time.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.680]   So that's the zoom dysmorphia.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.360]   Is it because zoom does something to our image that isn't real or is it because we're
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.720]   finally saying, you're saying, you're saying, you're not.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.080]   You're saying, I got to it dysmorphia.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.200]   I have twit dysmorphia.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   I didn't notice.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.640]   Do you know what it?
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.640]   You look great.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   What are you talking about?
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.480]   No, I, I've noticed, well, one, I burned my head several weeks ago with the curling
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   iron.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   So I see this all the time now.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.960]   I would never think about it otherwise.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   No, that's true.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   I never think about it.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   No, I can't see it.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   It's really horrible.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.440]   Just coloration here.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.880]   I actually went to, what are they called?
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:34.040]   Like a laser person to see if I could get that fixed because I was like, and again,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.280]   we never noticed it.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   I had the type of face.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.600]   I never would have seen those looking at her.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.920]   I am now can't, can't not see it actually.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.080]   But you can't look at it.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.720]   I can't not see them either.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   You know what?
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.960]   I always like, I got an, I got advice for you.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   Bangs.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   Bangs.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   There you go.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   Thanks so terrible with you have curly hair.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   Oh.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   Good Lord.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   That is like the biggest ever.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.560]   I don't, you'll either, you know, you'll either see it or not see it.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.200]   I can't change that, but it does kind of not.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.560]   This is the best paragraph in this article.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:13.440]   While Snapchat dysmorphia has existed since 2015 and is connected to so-called alien face,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.600]   big eyes abnormally raised cheekbones, zoom dysmorphia is different in a key way.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.000]   With Snapchat dysmorphia, patients would come in to see the cosmetic consultant with
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   a photo of themselves that would be heavily filtered.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.320]   Yet there's an awareness in the patients behalf that there's some dysmorphia going on.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.880]   But with zoom dysmorphia, it's unconscious.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.280]   People don't understand there's distortion happening with their cameras.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.760]   So there is nothing on your forehead.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.160]   It's, it's just zoom.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.280]   There's something wrong with my monitor.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   It's got a great spot on it.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280]   I can't, I can't figure out.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:57.240]   As many selfies as I see online, I am calling total ball on this because selfies don't
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.600]   make anybody look good.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   That's not true.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:07.000]   People change their, they like teach you how to take a good selfie, you know, like people,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.320]   I think maybe all are, I mean, one, I'm just going to throw this out here as a woman who
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   is inherently judged first off because I'm a woman by my appearance.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   So true.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.800]   That is the default expectation.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   It's a fact.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   It is.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:28.200]   I, I try, you know, I pay attention to these things even though I, I don't actually pay
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.160]   that much attention because I'm not, I don't know.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   I've never.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   You're not that tight.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   It's raised by wolves.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.160]   Yeah, you don't care.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:44.480]   I don't care mostly, but it is tough to see it every day and it is tough to feel like,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.200]   like if it'll actually, I know no one's judging me for it, right?
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:55.320]   Because what I say is more important, but I will say that girls and young women and older
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.200]   women are like, this is my neck look weird.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   Yeah, probably.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.520]   No, you know, teenage girls is noses.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.680]   That's why there's so many rhino plasties among teenage girls.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:12.160]   In fact, this article quotes a Harvard medical school professor, Dr. Shady Kourosh, who says
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.600]   there's an increase in appointment requests for appearance related issues during the
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.440]   pandemic increase.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:26.000]   Yes, in, in March, British plastic surgeons reported a 70% increase in consultations.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.840]   People were complaining about sagging skin in the lower face and neck.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.400]   We wondered if this was because people were holding their smartphones at odd angles.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.080]   They're while they're looking down.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.040]   And also there's a certain amount of distortion as you get closer.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.800]   These are somewhat wide angle, right?
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.840]   And so they, so that's, there's distortion that makes your nose look big, for instance.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.720]   So actually I'm not, I'm not surprised.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.080]   I mean, it's not like looking in a mirror and people don't spend hours of their, well,
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.600]   some people, most people, those teenage, teenage girls might, that's where the nose
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   feels maybe.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.200]   Yeah, but see, I had the opposite.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.720]   I want to meet for a long time.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.840]   Meat would not show you or to literally other people.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.560]   And I'm wondering, what do I look like right now?
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.040]   What if I pick my nose?
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.880]   Right.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.280]   I find it more comforting to me because it's for, you know, doing this show for 25 years,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.360]   to just know you get used to this.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.560]   And I have to say, as somebody has worked in television for years, it's, and radio, by
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.120]   the way, the same thing happens with your voice.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.880]   The first time you hear your voice, you remember that.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.960]   The first time you heard your record, or is it?
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   You hated it.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.840]   And then thank you for turning off the camera.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   Oh, there it is.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   Okay.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.440]   The first, after a while you get used to seeing yourself, but it's a weird experience for the
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.960]   first few years.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   So yeah, I'm not surprised that this is copping up.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.880]   And for everyone saying narcissism or vanity, I would say no, because we do judge a significant
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.920]   amount about people based on their appearance.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.600]   And we can see studies about people who are paid more or who are good looking, get paid
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.480]   more, both men and women.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   So right.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   I don't know.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.600]   I mean, yes, there is a point over which it becomes silly.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.840]   But it's almost the opposite of narcissism.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.880]   It's it's it's overblown humility, right?
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.640]   It's it's it's a bad self image is far more the case.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   I have terrible teeth.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.000]   I have a huge nose on pink.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.320]   I'm pink, I tell you, you know, and so I hate all of that, but not anything to do about
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.840]   it.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.360]   Here's a this was a shocker.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:39.440]   I find this really hard to believe an internal memo in the LAPD shows that employees, police
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:46.680]   officers are directed to use field interview cards, even when an individual is not arrested
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.680]   or even accused of a crime.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   Copies of the field interview cards, police complete when they question civilians reveal
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:01.880]   that LAPD officers are instructed to record a civilians Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.880]   other social media accounts alongside basic biographical information.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   Ew.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.280]   And it turns out this is the story about data matter.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.240]   No, this is the story.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.860]   And this is from the the Guardian also an internal memo further shows the police chief
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:23.540]   Michelle Moore told employees it was critical to collect the data for use in investigations,
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.740]   arrests, and prosecutions and warned that supervisors would review cards to ensure that
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.380]   they were complete.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:39.100]   Now look at line 92, if you read related, the LAPD worked with data minor during the George
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.140]   Floyd protests.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:48.340]   So they were tying your real life activity to your virtual life.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:54.540]   This comes from the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:00.420]   They were they were they checked with 40 other police agencies and weren't unable to find
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.500]   another department that required social media collection on interview cards.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:11.180]   Yeah, this probably started with Black Lives Matter.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.740]   Wow.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:18.340]   But it goes even fat farther back in 2015, the department added social media accounts as
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.780]   a line on the physical field interview cards.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:28.580]   Similar to a nickname or an alias, a person's online persona or identity used for social
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.060]   media can be highly beneficial to investigations.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.500]   This is Charlie back a former LAPD chief.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.020]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.740]   That's what the bad guys do too.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.900]   What's interesting is you don't have to have been arrested or even accused of a crime.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.780]   It's just if you're if you're interviewed by the police, then you refuse.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.420]   That's what I was going to ask.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:53.060]   If they're just interviewing me asking me questions, even though I'm not guilty, can
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.860]   I just just refuse to share?
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.140]   Well, I certainly would.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.700]   I think you have the right to.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.020]   Can I fourth amendment this one?
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   Is it fourth?
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.020]   No, fifth amendment?
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:08.060]   But as as you would not know, especially if you're Black saying no to a police officer
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:14.660]   could be a little risky quite possibly.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:22.380]   Additional info, additional, wow, email social media accounts, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.980]   They also want your gang or moniker.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.500]   I guess I, you know, it's over the trick game.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.140]   I don't think it's you also have the legitimate to have these fields.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.020]   I think what's the question is how much pressure there is to collect this from everybody.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.020]   Right.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:43.660]   Let's look at where these interviews could happen, per se.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:49.780]   Some gang run neighborhood or whatever and the police is doing their trying to do their
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.780]   job and they just trying to gather information and they go to ask all of these questions
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.700]   and the person that they're asking, they probably don't even know their rights.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   Right.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.780]   So, and just just this vision of Barrow for the law enforcement.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:10.740]   There's a group called Stop LAPD Spying Coalition and its director said it's like Stop and Frisk,
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.740]   which it is, I guess.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.340]   And it's happening with a clear goal of surveillance.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   Wow.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.020]   So they've got like internal lists, like known gang member lists on Twitter and you could
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.020]   just follow those.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   I don't know.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.860]   I mean, here's a really good guy's a doing to though.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.580]   All of the people out there doing these data breaches and whatnot, they're pretty much
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.780]   doing the same thing.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:41.100]   Just pinpointing NARED, who's the weak person that I can go and hit on and get my weight
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.580]   into said organization.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.620]   They're looking at all of that same stuff.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.380]   They're also asking for social security numbers.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.380]   And here's the disclaimer.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.540]   Oh, no, that's bull.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.780]   If, careful what you say, I might have to ask for your Twitter account.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.660]   If social security numbers are requested, the following disclaimer must be read, this
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.420]   is on the card.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.460]   Like this, federal law requires that you be informed when asked for your social security
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:09.740]   number that it must be provided for use in identification.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:14.660]   Authority for requiring this information is based upon field interview procedures operational
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.220]   prior to January 1, 1975.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:22.380]   Well, the social security number card was introduced.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.300]   It was not allowed for any form of identification because the room was freaking out about it.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.740]   It was privacy gotten shoots of the time.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.940]   And they talked to a loyal lawyer.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:35.740]   And they were right too, because like, remember how now it's associated with all this information.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.060]   People like stole your SSN from your like your hospital beds.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.740]   Well, I mean, Guardian asked Kathleen Kim, a loyal, a professor of law and immigrants
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:47.100]   rights expert who previously served in the LA police commission.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:52.780]   She said, I am not aware of any law requiring individuals to disclose social security numbers
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.260]   to local police.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.260]   That's a lie.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   They're actually lying.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.260]   They're back at like it lying.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   The police lying to people?
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   No.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.020]   She said she was shocked to learn about the social security section on the cards, noting
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.060]   it was so antithetical to the department's own policies and clearly violated the spirit
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.180]   of sanctuary laws.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.460]   Oh, that's why they asked for social security numbers.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:20.620]   I was wondering if you're a citizen or not.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:27.220]   Oh, oh, LAPD says we're updating the policy.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.540]   But we would decline to provide further details.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.780]   Wow.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:37.420]   That's just really, you know, you wonder where else this is happening.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:42.100]   Yeah, I mean, I would they say that for 40 other they asked around to see if anybody
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.100]   else is doing it.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.580]   But I bet you, what do you think?
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.580]   Minneapolis?
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:51.220]   Informally, if not Arizona, Arizona, all of Arizona.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:58.260]   ProPublica should get these cards from to do something useful, get these cards from police
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.100]   departments across the country.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.100]   They're foyer.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.740]   You should be able to get them.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.100]   Yeah, get them filled out cards.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.100]   Wow.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:11.580]   Well, there you go.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:21.220]   Australia's top court finds media companies are are liable for other people's Facebook
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:26.060]   comments, and not just Facebook, but also Twitter everywhere else.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:32.380]   So if you're a media company and you put a story up on Facebook and you allow comments
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:36.860]   there because of Facebook, you could cut it off that anyone's that anything says under
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:41.460]   that you are liable for as if it occurred in your own space.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.780]   That's great.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.940]   And you pray it is completely cray cray.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.580]   Oh, I guess who doesn't like this?
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.140]   Not so guess who doesn't like this Rupert Murdoch news.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.140]   Does it so bad?
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.140]   How bad is it?
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.140]   It is so bad.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.660]   It makes me agree with the Rupert Murdoch.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:02.820]   This is a corp call for legislators to change Australia's laws to protect them from liability.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.780]   It says it essentially makes media companies responsible for other people's comments, even
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.220]   when they're unaware that the comments have been posted.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:15.580]   They've appealed, news corp and nine entertainment have appealed to the high court.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.740]   So you want to know what it's like to get rid of section 230?
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.740]   This.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:19.740]   There you have it.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:20.740]   Wow.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   This is completely insane.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.660]   I know in the legal people I trust are going completely nuts about this.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.660]   I tweeted.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:36.380]   So this is actually this was the response to the appeal of a high court said, no, yeah,
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.940]   it's okay.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.100]   But the actual libel case hasn't occurred yet.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.780]   I put another explainer up on the rundown somewhere.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.820]   And so that's still going on.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.820]   This morning when I saw it, I was up early.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.380]   I said, wake up call to Jeff Kossaf and Daphne Keller and Mike Baznick.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.460]   I'm sure they're talking about it.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:58.700]   So you can if you post on these sites, you can say no comments, right?
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.900]   I guess only recently, only recently, but it'll say it's Twitter.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:08.780]   So on Twitter, you can say that you can't comment on that, but I can retweet it and comment
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.940]   on it and copy and paste it.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.940]   Comment on it.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:20.220]   So the whole point of section 230 was to enable a public conversation because what would happen
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.060]   is without that, then we'd see that it would be completely limited.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.580]   No one would go to any liability.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.700]   No one would allow any comments.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.580]   And we were stuck with the only mass media again.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.500]   This sucks.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.460]   And Australia's being stupid in Canada almost as stupid.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.820]   The case was initially initially brought by somebody named Dylan Voller.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.780]   He was detained in a juvenile detention center, became the subject of media attention.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.540]   There were articles about Mr. Voller that media outlets posted on Facebook drew comments
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:52.860]   from other Facebook users falsely accusing him of serious crimes.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.940]   Voller's lawyers said media companies have a strong commercial imperative to increase
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:02.660]   engagement on their posts and that they assisted the publication of the third party comments
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.380]   by posting articles in the first place.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.180]   His lawyers said this decision put responsibility where it should be on media companies with
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:15.420]   huge resources to monitor public comments and circumstances where they know there's a strong
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.300]   likelihood of an individual being defamed.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.620]   But it's more than that, Leo.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:29.980]   So let's say that you as a media company post something on Facebook and Stacy comes in and
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.820]   defames me in the comments under that.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.500]   I could sue Stacy and she has a nice house.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.460]   I couldn't get something out of it, but I'm far better off suing you because you're a
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.540]   media mogul and that's what's going to happen.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.500]   So in these cases, what they're saying is people are not going to sue the speaker.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.100]   They're going to sue the intermediary for liabilities.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.260]   This creates intermediary liability quite literally.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.740]   And so you're going to go after the biggest pockets and the biggest pockets going to be
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:58.740]   media companies.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.460]   And that's why Murdoch doesn't like this.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.100]   Well, also Jeff, you have a nice house as well.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.460]   I want two of them.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.460]   I'm greedy.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.300]   I want yours too.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.300]   Wow.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.220]   I'm looking at your like very classy study and I'm like, I don't know, Jeff, your house
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220]   seems pretty fancy.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.220]   Don't go after mine.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.220]   Oh, geez.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.020]   So now now is a little aunt.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.260]   You and I are in trouble because we made fun of her bib last week.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:28.940]   She's going to sue us now.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.220]   But you made fun of my jacket.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.780]   So I'm going after you and a bring it.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:37.340]   We're all going to sue each other.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.380]   Losses for everyone.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.820]   All right.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.500]   What else is on our list of things we can have hot takes about?
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.500]   Oh, you want a hot take on Yahoo?
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.300]   Yahoo.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:53.940]   The acquisition of Yahoo from Verizon has been completed.
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:57:00.340]   The Yahoo and AOL, formerly known as Verizon Media, have been acquired by the Apollo Global
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.620]   Management and their new name is Yahoo.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.620]   Yahoo.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.100]   Any information for it?
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.100]   Is there an explanation for it?
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   No.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.700]   Well, maybe the Verge doesn't do the exclamation mark.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.180]   You know, so people are funny about that.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.900]   No, no publication should.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.820]   We used to like Yahoo is to call us in.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.220]   We have an exclamation to shut up.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.220]   No, you don't.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.780]   Part of the name.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.860]   It's like when eBay would get mad when it was at the beginning of a sentence and it'd
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.300]   be like, oh, we are lowercase E and I'm like, at the beginning of the sentence, you are
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   not.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.740]   So is this the official death of AOL?
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.820]   No, I mean, it's still against all.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.020]   I guess not AOL continues.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.020]   I don't know.
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.220]   I mean, no tech company dies.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.940]   I mean, radio shacks still exist as a brand.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.100]   I mean, my gosh, oh, nothing.
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.660]   We just can't let things in.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.940]   So this was, of course, the oath brand.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.940]   Then became known as Verizon Media, which then became known as Yahoo again.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:58.940]   Yahoo.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:03.860]   The only company worse at branding on Earth is Google.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.100]   That's where TechCrunch is, right?
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.100]   With this tech crunch and gadget.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.460]   They'll all be run by Apollo Global Management.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.620]   I wonder if you're going to do, what is it, the Red Ventures that bought CNET?
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:22.340]   I wonder if they're going to pull like that service journalism affiliate link slash.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:26.140]   There was actually a good article about Red Ventures in the times a couple of weeks ago.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   I thought it was.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.140]   I was impressed.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:33.860]   I thought they were kind of, maybe they weren't an evil private equity company.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.780]   They seem to actually want to do journalism.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:37.780]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.540]   Well, they wanted to do journalism that led to purchases.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.660]   I mean, they wanted to do a wire cutter, basically, which is fine.
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.660]   I mean, that is, that is.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.060]   There's got to be a model, just got to be a model of some kind.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.140]   Well, when we've dealt with that, we've got, we have a commerce group.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.620]   And what we hear from the people who do that for a living is they say that they have more
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:02.180]   trust at stake with the public than if they were just selling them forever ties.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.540]   If I tell you to buy this and it's crap, I'm going to ask this.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:10.980]   I feel terrible when someone's like, this did not work for me.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.980]   I'm like, what?
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.980]   No.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.940]   So this is not exactly Red Ventures.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:25.340]   Apollo owns Chuck E. Cheese restaurants, Michael's Art Stores, and the Las Vegas Venetian
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.340]   Resort.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.340]   Okay.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.820]   So it's kind of one of those things is pretty awesome.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.660]   And it's not Chuck E. Cheese, y'all.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.660]   It's Michael.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:34.660]   I'm guessing Michael's Michael's.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.500]   Oh, it is the Venetian.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.500]   Good Lord.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.460]   I do like, I like the Venetian.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.460]   I like the Venetian.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.100]   I didn't take you as a gambler, Stacey.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.820]   Oh, oh, I'm not.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   But I like nice hotels.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:46.820]   And you like the fountains.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   It's the biggest for work.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.820]   And it's an all sweet hotel.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   Let's be honest.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.820]   It is.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.820]   It's nice.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.820]   But don't be nice.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   She's a very pretty.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.820]   I like.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.300]   Have you ever stayed at the Venetian Jeff?
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.180]   No, it's not cheesy than anything else in Vegas.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.740]   Well, the Las Vegas Cheese, it's not circus circus.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.980]   No, it's less grungy than all of you.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   The Venetian is quite nice.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.060]   Yeah, it's a very nice place.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.260]   We like to stay there.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.260]   Oh, I admit it.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.020]   Anyway, there it is.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.020]   Yahoo.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.340]   By the way, don't mock Yahoo.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.580]   They still have 900 million monthly active users.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.140]   Almost a billion.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:33.420]   I finally stopped using Yahoo finances my go-to for like an RSS feed on the companies I'm
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   following.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.420]   Oh, really?
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.460]   I finally Google finance it finally got better.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:43.020]   It got good enough, I guess, to avoid Yahoo.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.700]   I still use Yahoo, I think.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.620]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:51.940]   So you say I never, Google finances is finally up to Schniff.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.940]   It's up to mode.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:58.060]   I don't need as many features anymore because I'm not doing as hardcore like I'm not having
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.260]   to write earnings reports and track that kind of stuff as much anymore.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:06.100]   But yeah, Yahoo finance was my absolute favorite.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.020]   I find myself Yahoo only because I hit news paywalls and when I look at five stories with
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.300]   the cover in the same story on Google, Yahoo will be the free one.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.340]   We mentioned, did we not last week or when we was on Sunday?
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:22.060]   I think we mentioned last week that the House Republicans wrote a letter to Yahoo's chief executive
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.060]   officer, Maurice Meyer.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.060]   I don't think we did on this show.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.060]   No, we did not.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.060]   No.
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.060]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.060]   They wrote it to Meyer?
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.060]   So.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.060]   So.
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:38.060]   Do you know their staffers do all their work for them?
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060]   I think the staffers did it.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.740]   And some staffer just screwed up.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.500]   This was one of a bunch of letters they wrote to telecom company.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.460]   No, no, they wrote to telecom companies saying whatever you do, don't hand over Kevin McCarthy
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:54.180]   and Marjorie Taylor Greene's phone records in the January 6th commission investigation.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.460]   And among the letters they sent out was to immerse Meyer, CEO of Yahoo.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.340]   Audegis lawyers are having to fit.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.340]   Who prodigy?
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.340]   It's really prodigy.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.420]   They're not still a prodigy.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.700]   13 letters sent out and I think you're right.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.580]   I think it's exactly what I said on Sunday was, you know, it's some staffer.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.300]   We can't really blame.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:25.860]   I mean, do you want your citizens to have a vague or sorry, your senators and representatives
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.180]   to have a vague understanding of the big CEO?
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.380]   She did leave Yahoo four years ago.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:36.580]   I mean, like I'm kind of like vague would be an improvement, Miss Stacy.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.580]   I know.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.580]   Very, very big.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.780]   Isn't Marissa was it Marissa Meyer, the head of Yahoo?
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.180]   Remember her?
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180]   That's right.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.180]   Her a letter to.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.180]   Long girl.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   That's not a person.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.180]   That's not a person.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.180]   She used to be a hoo go or something.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.180]   Right.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:58.020]   The, the Theranos trial began to pick the jury.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.020]   You're following?
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.940]   Yeah, I thought I'm waiting for big fireworks.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.540]   It's not been a whole lot yet.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:10.780]   There Elizabeth Holmes lawyers said, Hey, you can't, you can't be prosecuted for failing.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.780]   She tried really hard and failed.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.060]   I think there is a case to be made on the other hand by the prosecution that maybe
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.420]   she might have known they were going to fail and kept raising money.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   Was it fraud to her investors, basically?
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.420]   Right.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   That's what she's being charged with.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.820]   I mean, she lied to reporters 100.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.540]   I also wonder, I mean, she started that.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:35.740]   I mean, I remember covering Theranos in its early days and interviewing her as a 21-year-old
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.660]   girl.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.140]   And she was doing this project out of, you know, work she had done at Stanford and I
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.460]   don't know, somewhere in Singapore or something.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:51.420]   And I interviewed her and she was very quiet and there was so much media pressure.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:57.740]   And I'm just trying to imagine myself at 21 and even at 23 and having this level of scrutiny
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.660]   and then realizing it doesn't work.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:07.340]   And I'm not, I'm not saying that fraud is, but I do think that the pressure she was under
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:12.180]   and the advice she was probably given was probably pretty, oh, I shouldn't have said
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.180]   that.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.180]   I'm so sorry.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.180]   I'm pretty bad.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:22.140]   In fact, that is thought that her defense team will argue that she was abused and controlled
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.780]   by her partner, Sonny Malani, who was also her boyfriend at the time.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.500]   And so it may be, maybe they'll have to.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.340]   I'm not saying she's right.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:40.300]   I just feel like, I feel like a lot of people probably did a big disservice to her by,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:45.780]   I just, I just can't, if I put myself in that situation, like being a very type A studious,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.700]   she struck me as very quiet, very interested in the science and having so much writing
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   on that.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.860]   I don't know.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.460]   I think Rupert Murdoch might be called to testify, which would be kind of fun.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.460]   He was an investor.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:05.500]   He invests in all the best thing.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:11.780]   I think that's the other thing is you see who's on the board of Theranos and it wasn't people
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.380]   who knew about biotech or medical technologies.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.100]   It was Henry Kissinger and George Schultz.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.740]   It was a bunch of big names that had no technical knowledge.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.260]   And that looks a little bit like mad dog, Mattis.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.020]   Looks a little bit like you're collecting names, not looking for anybody to critique
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.020]   what you're up to.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:36.100]   Well, yeah, nobody wants investors who'll critique what they're up to.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.740]   I mean, have you met an entrepreneur?
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.740]   I mean, that's...
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.780]   The goal is not to be like.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.780]   So it'll be fraud versus failure.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   How much did she know?
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.780]   When did she know?
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.620]   When did she know it?
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.500]   It'll be interesting.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.340]   It'll be interesting to see.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:58.020]   I think it might be a fascinating trap, but we'll keep an eye on it.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.740]   So far, not so fascinating.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.740]   Let's see.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.740]   Should I do...
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.220]   Let's take a break and then we can come back.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.180]   We've got the changelog and some big changes at Twitter.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.500]   A lot of interesting tests going on.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500]   Really interesting stuff.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.980]   We got to say something about Google, too.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.980]   Yeah, changelog.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.980]   I mentioned that.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.980]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:21.860]   It's been a slow weekend tech.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   We had a hard time actually with our show.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.380]   Actually, Google is changing a whole bunch of stuff in workspace.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   A lot of stuff.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   Was it called now?
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   Is it workspace?
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.380]   It's a workspace.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.380]   It's a workspace.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.380]   I always forget.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:38.780]   Although they just bought a company called PlaySpace.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.980]   So now they'll have workspace and PlaySpace.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.980]   And Play.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.980]   And Play.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.660]   But they finally rolled out the spaces thing that they talked about at Google.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.260]   So it actually is quite a bit to talk about Google in just a little bit.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:56.780]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.780]   It's so tempting.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:04.700]   You hear about people making a ton of money in Bitcoin or on GameSpot stock.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.540]   It's probably really tempting to say, "Oh, if I could just get in there at the beginning,
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.540]   I can make so much money."
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.220]   I got bad news for you.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.860]   The secret to building Wealth is really simple.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.060]   It's not day trading.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:26.760]   It's not following stock's stonk memes or taking rocket ships to the moon.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.060]   If you want to grow your long-term wealth, if you want to make it to the moon, you've
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.120]   got to go step by step.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.660]   And it's easy to do.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.420]   It's not exciting.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.580]   It's maybe a little boring, but it's easy.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.180]   Just open a Wealthfront investment account today.
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.020]   The data is clear.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:50.860]   Investors that trade individual stocks, stock picking, we call it, underperform the market
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.020]   every year.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.300]   In fact, only about 1% of day traders beat the market.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.120]   The odds just aren't in your favor if you're going in alone.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.480]   Everybody thinks they're smarter than the other guy.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.160]   The other guy almost always has more information than you do.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.840]   Just team up with Wealthfront instead.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.800]   I tell my kids this too.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   It's really simple.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.640]   Start putting money away now.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.320]   Put it in Wealthfront.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.680]   They have the right tools for every portfolio, whether you're a beginner or you're investing
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.880]   for years, whether you're about to retire or you're building up for your future, whether
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.440]   it's to buy a home or send the kids to college or you have to retire.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.820]   Wealthfront will interview you in effect, give you some questions, understand your goals,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:39.620]   your risk tolerance, and then create a portfolio of globally diversified low-cost index funds
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.260]   personalized for you in just minutes.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.700]   Yeah, I didn't say it would be exciting.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.460]   And there's no manual trades, no picking stocks, no watching the stock market every
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   day.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.220]   They handle all the investing based on the preferences you control.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.780]   In fact, they can do something pretty sophisticated.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.580]   Most investors don't even know about, called tax loss harvesting.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.860]   They can help you lower the taxes you pay as you invest.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.420]   In fact, they can do it so well.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:10.220]   It can more than cover the low annual 0.25% advisory fee.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   Yeah, you heard that right.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.460]   0.25% advisory fee.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.980]   That's very, this is right.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:24.140]   You can go to a broker and have them pick stocks for you and give him 1% or 2% of what
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   you make.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.900]   And that just eats away everything.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.060]   I'm talking 0.25% and it's completely automatic.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.260]   Wealthfront is really brilliant.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:37.660]   Tressed by many, many folks, over $20 billion in assets now.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:42.180]   In fact, I think what we started talking about Wealthfront, it was a quarter of that.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:47.540]   You can get your first $5,000 managed for free by going to wealthfront.com/tweigh.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.500]   It only takes $500 to get started.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.900]   I especially want to talk to you young people because now is the time.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.780]   Just a little bit of time.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.060]   Put away just a small percentage of your income and grow your wealth the easy way.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.660]   Let Wealthfront do the work.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:07.140]   No, you don't get to go on Reddit and say, "I got diamond hands to the moon," and that
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.340]   stuff.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.180]   But slowly but surely you're going to accumulate and you're going to be glad.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.700]   I'm telling you, you're going to be glad.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.260]   It's easy.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.460]   It's affordable.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   That's the right way to do it.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:22.020]   To get your first $5,000 managed for free for life, that's pretty nice.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:25.820]   Go to wealthfront.com/tweigh.
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:42.740]   We're talking to Kevin Rose on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.940]   He said, "Oh, I love Wealthfront."
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.220]   Here's a guy who has done some of the most aggressive and interesting investing in the
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.220]   world.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.100]   He's a venture capitalist angel investor.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.460]   He's in the Bitcoin and NFTs.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.700]   He said, "Yeah, I love Wealthfront."
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.780]   He said, "I invested in them."
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.900]   Wealthfront.com/tweigh.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.700]   A great company and doing really good work for you.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.220]   Thank you, Wealthfront.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.620]   Twitter.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:18.100]   So Twitter, a lot of stuff.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.500]   The first public tests of communities.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.380]   I'm dying to get it on this.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.180]   Right now it's dogs.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.460]   I like dogs so they don't attack me.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.220]   I tweeted the best dog video today.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.460]   See, you should be invited into communities.
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.660]   I should be invited into dogs communities.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.140]   Here's the post from a Twitter engineer.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.940]   We're rolling out our first public testing of communities which gives people a place
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.900]   to have more focused conversations with people who share the same interests.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.260]   It sounds like Reddit to me.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:55.220]   Communities introduces two very key mechanics that I think are worth touching on.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.740]   So click on that thread.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740]   Or no, go down further in history.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.740]   Okay.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:00.740]   Oops.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.740]   Oops.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.740]   You've had to use Twitter thing work.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.740]   I don't understand.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.260]   It was the last time you logged in.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.260]   Go back to K-bond's.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.260]   Go back to K-bond's.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.260]   Go back.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.260]   Go back.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   Go back.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:18.980]   Like K-bond says, one, tweets you post in communities are narrow-casted to only the
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.140]   people in that community.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.220]   They're still public, but they aren't amplified to all your followers and they don't show
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.820]   up in your profile.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:29.780]   We think this can lower the pressure of talking on Twitter.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.860]   I think a lot of people who are on Twitter want it to go to the largest possible number
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.860]   of people, but okay.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.860]   So you don't put it in communities.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:42.140]   But in the case where I'm in my bookwanks, my book history wanks community.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.420]   And right now I'm not really in the community because I've picked all of them from my list,
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.860]   but I'd rather be in a community with them able to ask my wonky book history Gutenberg
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.860]   questions to that group specifically.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.420]   Reddit test is so well.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.380]   I wonder, you know, and in this kind of, you're kind of sticking this on top of Twitter,
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.300]   which is really of a different beast.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.980]   I feel like, no, all right.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.740]   Sounds like Reddit envy to me being this week in Google.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.420]   No, Jack's talked about this for a long time about trying to do more communities at less.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.740]   Sorry, being being this week in Google, Google plus was attempting to do the exact same thing.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.740]   It's this call.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.740]   Remember?
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.740]   Yeah, it failed.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:26.460]   Well, this is the voice of expertise as a social media manager, Mr. Ann Pruitt.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.900]   So the initial, the initial one of them are you your community manager.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900]   What?
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.860]   The initial communities are hashtag Astro Twitter.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.420]   I guess astronomy, right?
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.740]   That's John would like that.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.820]   #dog Twitter for you, Jeff.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:53.420]   #skin #skincare Twitter for you, Stacey, and your, and your dot and #soulfood for sneaker
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.420]   lovers.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.620]   So le, soul food sneaker lovers.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.060]   I'm, there's nothing for me in here.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.060]   So much people join a community.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.060]   Like dogs.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.900]   I don't have a dog though.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.940]   You know, I said really, maybe it's more like Facebook groups.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.940]   You think maybe a little bit.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940]   Yeah, it kind of sounds more like that.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.220]   Communities have moderators.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.100]   These mods determine the rules and the social norms within that community.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.220]   Do, does Facebook groups have mods like that?
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.380]   Yeah, they do, don't they?
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.380]   You have to have.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.380]   Well, it depends.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.980]   I can start a group and abuse it.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.980]   Oh, I see.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.900]   Yeah, but it doesn't, it's not a, I'm guessing here if you screw up the community, you might
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.900]   get who does it.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.300]   Well, you can do more if the mods can hide tweets and kick people out as well.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.620]   We're just, what does Twitter do to a bad mod?
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.620]   Mm.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.420]   Kvonne continues.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   We're just getting started here.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.060]   We'll be scaling up communities as we learn more and improve the product.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.060]   Lots of new features and improvements on the way in the future.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.740]   Anybody could start a community today.
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.820]   Creation is limited to what we're testing at which Jeff Jarvis begged.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.820]   Please.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:58.020]   Yeah, I wonder what their testing strategy is.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:05.660]   Because what I remember the most about Google+, and Google+ communities was the bad actors
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:09.060]   and how much time I spent fighting off the spam.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.020]   Yeah, just fighting off the spam and the trollers and stuff like that.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.500]   It was an effort.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   I wonder what they have in place to try to keep that stuff at bay.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.860]   Because there are going to be groups that are pretty exclusive, if you will, it might
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.860]   be saying, I don't know, a black photographers group or...
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.660]   That'd be cool.
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:35.780]   And that group could get trolled by someone and say, "Hey, this is a racist group."
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   Stuff like that.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.980]   Well, the mods can kick people out.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.260]   No, that's an inherent problem with communities.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.900]   It's very hard to do well.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.500]   So I'll be interested to see how they do it.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.500]   They're also...
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:54.060]   Good communities don't scale.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.860]   You as a photographer might like this, they're trying edge-to-edge pictures and video in the
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.860]   timeline.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.580]   So instead of that little bitty picture, you go all the way to the edge.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.940]   Yeah, it's still on a foreign phone.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.340]   Yeah, it's still time to see.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.500]   From bezel to bezel.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.300]   You know, from sea to shining bezel.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   So that's...
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.780]   And all of these are tests that are rolling out slowly.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.780]   There's another new one...
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.180]   We're in the middle of the Twitter change log.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.140]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.140]   It really is, isn't it?
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.140]   Twitter supports us.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.700]   We're making it easier to be the curator of your own followers list.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:36.060]   Now you can remove a follower without blocking them and they won't know you've removed them.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.060]   You ghost them.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.060]   This is really interesting.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060]   Wow.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   I wonder...
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.900]   Oh, me and I wonder if people are going to have me and follow them.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.260]   As a reporter, this is interesting because sometimes you follow people just to keep up
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.860]   on movement or news or kind of...
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.540]   So I wonder if people, instead of just blocking them, will just start unfollowing reporters.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:07.100]   Well, I wonder if they're removed as a follower of yours and not essentially blocked, do
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.180]   they still see your content?
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.180]   No.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.180]   They can...
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.460]   If they go to your page, they'll see it, I think.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.100]   But they won't notice that...
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.580]   Yeah, I haven't heard from Matt in a while.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.580]   Why, he's just not doing what?
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.020]   Meanwhile, Anne is tweeting up a storm, but I don't see Anne because Anne said I'm too
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.500]   wrinkled and he didn't want me to follow.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.500]   So I guess this is a live...
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.020]   Shabbat's cuz you're too pink.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.180]   I guess this is live.
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.540]   And my nose is too big.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540]   No pinky.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.540]   No pinky's a lot.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:39.860]   I guess this is a live now because I can go to my list of followers and I can click the
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.500]   3Dock and I can actually remove this follower.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.220]   So it's not like a muter or a block.
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.180]   It's just they silently will stop seeing my tweets.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.500]   I learned something new today from Dave Warner because he begged to be taken out of the
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.820]   CC list on a Twitter conversation that was going on.
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.860]   And I didn't know you could take one person out of it.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.580]   Yes, that's a new feature as well.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:03.580]   That's nice too.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.580]   And...
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.340]   But we're doing lots of good stuff.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.740]   Yeah, you know, I like it.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.860]   It's funny they've gone for ages without doing anything and all of a sudden they're doing
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.860]   all sorts of things.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.420]   They've really did a lot of...
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.060]   I'm not as a chief product guy there.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.060]   Okay.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060]   He's one of us.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:26.580]   So this is all part of basically what they're calling new privacy tools.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.860]   Social privacy.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.860]   How users manage this.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:31.260]   Which they're oxymoron by the way.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.260]   Social privacy.
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.260]   By the way.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.740]   It's how you manage your reputation and identity on the service.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.340]   They better be careful with that actually because that's where Facebook got in trouble.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.180]   It's confusing public and private.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.180]   If you're on the internet, you're public.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.180]   Public.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.140]   And if you have this presumption that no one's going to see this, then the platform is going
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.140]   to get in trouble for that.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.580]   So they need to find, I think, a different way to position this.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.660]   You will also now be able to hide past tweets.
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.100]   That would save a lot of people.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.900]   A lot of trouble.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.420]   There are a number of people and their jobs.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.580]   I mean, it's like endless now people losing their jobs because of something they tweeted
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.580]   years ago.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:14.460]   I used a third party to leave his many of my go and groove from, I should say.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.220]   One hopes grew fun from.
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.620]   Well, some people delete all their tweets every year or so.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.460]   Yeah, I deleted a whole bunch of them.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.460]   Not because there was anything in there that I was embarrassed about.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:34.700]   No, I mean, sometimes as a reporter, I dump all my notes after every year because you
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.780]   have to have a system.
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:44.500]   Among other features being considered is being able to set a time limit on tweets.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.020]   So they're no longer visible to others after a specific amount of time you designate.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020]   Interesting.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:57.140]   By expiring tweets.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:01.460]   When social media, I'm sorry, social privacy needs are not met.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.820]   People limit their self-expression.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.900]   They withdraw from the conversation, says Twitter.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.380]   Well, I don't think any one service can be everything to all people.
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:15.620]   Like I'll be, I feel like all these companies are like, we must embrace as much of the social
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.980]   experience as possible.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.860]   But for that, you're going to need different products and some of them aren't going to
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.660]   scale well because there are conversations you will have with five people that you will
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.180]   not have with 5,000 people.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.340]   And if they could just get that through their freaking heads, that would be amazing.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:31.340]   That's all.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:35.860]   Oh, so this, so that tool to remove somebody from a conversation, only you could do it
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:41.860]   Jeff, but what's coming is the ability for Dave Weiner to do it himself.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.860]   So that's the new feature.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.420]   People love that.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.300]   Users will be given the option to remove themselves from a public conversation on Twitter.
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:54.860]   Oh, God, this times I get sometimes I just happen to be, you know, early on and then people
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.860]   get into a huge fight and it goes on.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.860]   And your name is still in there every time they respond.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.860]   Yeah, I know.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:01.860]   I don't.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:02.860]   That would be a nice feature.
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:05.860]   I've been using the mute conversation button.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.860]   Will that mute every, that conversation?
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:14.860]   Yeah, I, because I get hit on those, what do you call, follow Friday posts.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:19.860]   Fairly often and, you know, and I go through and read them, but after a while, I'm like,
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.860]   okay, I got all this stuff to do and I'm tired of seeing this notification.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:27.860]   I just hit mute conversation and I don't see that conversation anymore.
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:29.860]   It doesn't mean I unfollowed them or anything like that.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.860]   It just means I moved on to something else to talk about this particular day.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.860]   So this is, all of these new things is part of an initiative.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:42.860]   Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, this is from Bloomberg, said last March that Twitter
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:45.860]   has moved too slowly in recent years to launch new products.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:51.860]   He said that rolling out new tools more quickly was now a company wide goal naming it alongside
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.860]   revenue and user growth targets.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:58.860]   Specifically, Dorsey said that he wanted to double the number of features per employee
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.860]   that directly drive either user growth or revenue.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.860]   You're a small one now.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:10.860]   And that's the thing, Miss Stacy, you talked about the, not all of these platforms are going
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:15.860]   to be for everybody, but that's not going to stop them from being ambitious and wanting
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.860]   to have more users.
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.860]   That's their end goal because I'm sure some investor is telling them, hey, we need more
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.860]   market share and what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:29.860]   We use remote use.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.860]   It's a metric.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:35.860]   It's a KPI we care about.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.860]   KPI's.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.860]   What's that stand for?
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.860]   I spent 10 years trying not to learn that.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860]   What KPI is?
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860]   Sorry.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.860]   Yeah, I just said I'm not going to do it.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.860]   I only know it so I can make fun of it if it makes you feel better.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.860]   KPI key performance indicator?
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.860]   Managing job performance.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.860]   That sounds like the kind of thing some crap jobs would do.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860]   Not ours.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   We don't care how you perform.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.860]   No, actually did the show go out?
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.860]   It is worth it.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.860]   Yeah, we're worse.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.860]   We don't tell you what the performance indicator is.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.860]   We just watch and look.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:20.860]   So Ann's going to start using that on members of the Twit Club.
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.860]   Your KPI's are not up as well.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.860]   That gives me anxiety.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:35.860]   I hate the idea of now you're responsible for twice as many initiatives that will double
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860]   revenue.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.860]   I hate that the company that I do the radio show for premier has something like that for
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:45.860]   their executives where they have no 15% increase in revenue every year.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.860]   It gives me just a pit, a hole in the pit of my stomach.
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.860]   I just don't, I can't take it.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.860]   You run your own business.
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   You're responsible for all of these things on your business.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.860]   I mean, you're responsible for revenue, doubling growth, whatever.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.860]   I know.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   I guess it's Lisa really.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.860]   Yeah, I don't do anything.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:10.860]   I'll just sit here.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.860]   I know.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.860]   I outsourced that to Lisa.
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860]   How's your KPI?
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.860]   All right.
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.860]   Keep up the good work.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:20.860]   No, you know, Lisa's really good in telling me how things are going.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.860]   When they're bad, she tells me when they're good.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.860]   They're actually going, "Well, this quarter."
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.860]   And she tells me, "Yeah, I'm just talented.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   I don't ever want to be responsible for anything."
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.860]   I just want to.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.860]   That's where I am now.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.860]   That's where I am.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.860]   But, you know.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.860]   This is a show of people who want to evade responsibility.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:40.860]   That's really it.
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:41.860]   Wait a second.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.860]   Do you have any responsibilities?
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.860]   I have responsibilities to this network, sir.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:55.260]   But does it give you anxiety to, if I say, "Well, we'd love you to triple the membership
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.260]   in the club."
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.260]   What if I said that?
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.860]   I wouldn't give you anxiety.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.860]   What's the bonus for that night?
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:04.860]   Anxiety is not what comes in mind.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   It's more of like, "Well, that makes sense."
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   They want this product to grow.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.860]   Just like any other business, you have a product and you want to be able to grow from it.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.860]   This is why you're a great employee and why I'm a terrible employee.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:19.860]   And if they're reasonable, they shouldn't give you anxiety.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:25.860]   Yeah, and then as a thing, I've never been asked anything unreasonable from you or Mrs. LaPorte.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:31.860]   Hey, come in here and create some great content and grow your show, period.
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.860]   Alright, good.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.860]   And you're doing it.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.860]   So good.
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.860]   Keep up the good work.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.860]   Doing my best, anyway.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:37.860]   Thank you.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.860]   Good news.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.860]   Good news.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   Google's YouTube music is doing great.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:53.860]   50 million paid subscribers way ahead of the goals.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.860]   Take a talk about KPIs.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   Oh, they got them at Google.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.860]   Oh, they got them.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.860]   Oh, I bet they do.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.860]   50 million subscribers earlier than expected.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Now, you got to compare that to 165 million premium subscribers on Spotify.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:14.860]   You know, it's a dist, let's see.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   Spotify's number one.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:21.860]   I would say Apple Music was, I think, something like, what is Apple Music?
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.860]   They can't be top 30, no way.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:26.860]   Who else would be in the top three?
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:31.860]   Spotify, Ztop, streaming music services.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:37.860]   Because I've never heard of Apple Music being anything someone enjoyed.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.860]   Spotify, title is ahead of Apple.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:43.860]   And Apple's number three.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.860]   No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   That's the best, not the biggest.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.860]   Oh, that's not biggest.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.860]   That's just for reviews.
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.860]   Oh, I'm not a photo title.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:52.860]   Yeah, title.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:55.860]   Yeah, that would be kind of a shock, wouldn't it?
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.860]   Okay, let's do that search again.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.860]   Top music streaming services.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.860]   Top is a bad word.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.860]   Most biggest.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.860]   Biggest.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:06.860]   There you go.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.860]   Thank you.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:08.860]   I'll get this Google.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:09.860]   I'm an editor.
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.860]   Someday.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.860]   You know what?
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:19.860]   All the answers I got from a biggest are best music streaming service, best online music streaming service.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.860]   I guess nobody has those numbers.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:24.860]   Most popular.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.860]   How are you going to measure best?
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:26.860]   Is it the number?
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.860]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.860]   Here's the most popular.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.860]   Here we go.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:35.860]   Now, this is a poll though by UGov.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   I don't think this counts.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:43.860]   Yeah, no, I guess I thought they revealed these numbers, but active users put that in your query.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.860]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:46.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.860]   Well, the Google is failing you today.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:55.860]   Select Count active users from Music Stream and Service where...
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.860]   Good, better than terminal.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.860]   Okay.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:06.860]   This is a little added date, I think.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.860]   Apple Music.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.860]   Yes, this is wrong.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.860]   It's 18.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.860]   This is wrong.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:16.860]   Because it says Spotify is behind Apple Music, which is not the case.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   I'm not in the IRC.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.860]   I'm sure IRC has it.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   Oh, let me check.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.860]   Apple is believed to have between 70 and 80 million subscribers, but it hasn't updated those numbers
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.860]   since 2019 says the chat.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.860]   So that's why.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:38.860]   So, Spotify 165 million, Apple, let's say 80 million, and then YouTube, pretty respectable 50 million.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.860]   I think it's a respectable third place.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860]   How much is YouTube?
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.860]   Would you rather be Spotify or Google?
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.860]   What do you mean, "rather" in life?
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.860]   I'd rather be Google.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.860]   Yeah, so...
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   Yeah, you mean...
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.860]   Actually, you should say, "Who's wallet would you rather have?"
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.860]   Daniel Eck or Larry Page's?
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.860]   Yeah, Amazon's wallet.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   Google Music...
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:13.860]   See, I think YouTube Music is a little bit funny because it also includes YouTube Premium,
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.860]   no ads.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   And actually, that's the reason I have Google Music.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:22.260]   In fact, in a way, for me, what it was, was I bought YouTube Premium and I got YouTube
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.260]   Music as an additional benefit.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.860]   It's the Amazon Prime strategy.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.860]   If you buy YouTube TV, do you get YouTube Premium or those are totally separate?
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:32.860]   It's totally separate because I tried that.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   No, yeah, YouTube.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:35.860]   It would be nice.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.860]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   I tried that too.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.860]   You think it's a lot?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.860]   Yeah, you think.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.860]   So I dropped YouTube TV and...
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:41.860]   It's really expensive.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.860]   It's really expensive.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:44.860]   Yeah, it's really expensive.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   It's like 65 bucks.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.860]   Yeah, unless you want to get 4K.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.860]   But it goes up...
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.860]   85 dollars.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.860]   Yeah, it goes up.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860]   Yikes.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.860]   But the 4K does look good.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.860]   There is not a lot of 4K content if you like sports.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   In fact, you would like it, because a lot of the college football, oddly enough, is 4K.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:02.860]   Not NFL.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.860]   But college football.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.860]   Yeah, I'm still on Hulu TV live and it's fine.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:09.860]   It's fine.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:10.860]   Yep.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.860]   Plus, it doesn't screw up my YouTube algorithm as far as the recommendation.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.860]   It's go to.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   So, YouTube TV was dipping into that.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:20.860]   So, Kettleway.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:26.860]   To answer your question, Stacey, there's a family plan, which is what I think I get.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:29.860]   And I think that's $15 a month.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.860]   And then the regular plan is 10 bucks a month.
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.860]   They're all pretty much the same in the US.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.860]   Okay, so they're the same.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.860]   They're all roughly in the same ballpark.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.860]   So here's an interesting stat for all that YouTube's doing.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:48.860]   Well, TikTok has actually overtaken YouTube for average watch time in the US and the UK.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   Yeah, it's all of our roll hooks.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.860]   That's Google-handedly.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.860]   We're all hook.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.860]   This comes from App Annie.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.860]   That's me.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   Now, because YouTube has, by far, the most users, it's got the largest overall time spent,
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.860]   you know, millions of hours or whatever.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   Two billion monthly YouTube users.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:14.420]   TikTok is only about 700 million as of mid 2020.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:21.860]   But average amount of time per user spent on the app is higher for TikTok, which surprises
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:27.420]   me because my sense of people who use YouTube like the hardheads, Ant, are that they will
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.740]   just keep it running and running and running and running and running and running for hours
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.740]   on end.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.740]   No, that's me.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:33.740]   That's you.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:34.740]   They watch YouTube.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:39.740]   They watch YouTube.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:44.740]   I'm seriously sitting at it, sitting now watching YouTube just like it was the regular broadcast
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:45.740]   television.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.740]   Do you pick the next video, Anne, or you just let it pick for you?
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:50.740]   It depends.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:55.420]   But here recently, I've just been letting it go random because I've just been trying to
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:59.220]   just let go and chill out when I'm off the clock.
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:03.740]   And it's just been putting up some really good stuff here recently.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:10.380]   It does look like I'm looking at, this is actually kind of interesting, a talent agency
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:16.020]   in Liverpool created a TikTok character using this actress.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.980]   Her name is Gabi Blucash, but she calls herself Gabi Face.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:23.300]   She has seven million followers on TikTok, but it is synthetic.
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.420]   It's created by an agency.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   It's designed.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.060]   They do that with YouTube too.
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.060]   Yeah, sure.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.900]   Look at she's opening toys.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:35.860]   In fact, YouTube is chasing these people off.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.700]   So this is a talent influencer agency.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   Can you believe that?
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Wow.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.780]   I can because there's money in it.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:45.780]   I can.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:46.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:52.660]   You know, the people I follow on TikTok are usually, I follow them because I want more
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.660]   stories.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.180]   Hey, I'm going to buy a pink wave that looks almost like that.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   Believe it or not.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.860]   You too could have seven million followers on TikTok.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.020]   You could actually.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.020]   I think if you wanted to.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.020]   Oh, no.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.020]   I have eyes.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.020]   Oh, no.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.020]   Oh, no.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.580]   Look, this is easy.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:12.740]   It's picking up a camera, smiling and doing what you love.
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:14.860]   You'd be perfect at it.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.860]   That's all it takes.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860]   It's so smiley.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.700]   And you need a ring light.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.660]   TikTok waffles with Stacy.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:24.300]   Oh, man, if you did the waffle channel, you'd be huge.
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.300]   Sign me up.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:26.300]   You'd be huge.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.300]   I would be so large.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.300]   I'm not eating other waffles.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.780]   Your jawful term.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:37.780]   Who loves waffles?
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.780]   I love.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.780]   Sign me up.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:43.380]   We could just watch you get fat.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.380]   It'd be fun.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.380]   That'd be a good channel.
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:46.380]   There you go.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:47.700]   That'd be really good channel.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:52.020]   She started very slim, but you know, five years into the waffle channel, she can't move
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020]   it on.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.020]   Waffles?
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.220]   I think it would take like maybe a year.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.220]   A year.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.220]   Okay.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:33:59.220]   So it's syrup.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.500]   Waffles are like pretty much all butter in deliciousness.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   They're so good.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.500]   They're so good.
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:05.500]   Oh, man.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.580]   I mean, yeah, I'm not knocking that.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:12.900]   I'm just saying that indiscriminate waffle consumption could be problematic.
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.700]   I think that's the title of the show indiscriminate waffle consumption.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.180]   That's what KPI stands for, isn't it?
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:24.700]   There we go.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.700]   New video from Amazon warning new homeowners.
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.620]   Your house is not safe.
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:32.700]   Well, it's not from Amazon.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.620]   It's an Amazon driver.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:46.220]   Oh, Amazon FlexWorker Kelsey is giving advice to a new homeowner, Jessica.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.140]   This is by the way, guess where on the TikTok.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:53.140]   Kelsey can be seen approaching the house while handing advice via the doorbell camera.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.140]   You should pray it last time.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.140]   Oh, should I?
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:56.140]   Okay.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.140]   What was he like to hear?
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:04.140]   And then she comes up and then yeah, here.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:06.140]   Watch.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.140]   Is there sound on this?
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:10.940]   Hello Jennifer.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.300]   I hope your mom is going well.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:17.940]   You have no markers on your house and says what number you are.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.620]   And that is hard to find your house.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.620]   My dude.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:21.620]   And it's unsafe.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.620]   Honestly.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.900]   I needed a medical assistance and the paramedics didn't know your town well.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:27.900]   Come on.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:28.900]   All right.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.940]   Thank you, Amazon driver.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   A busybody.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   Amazon driver.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940]   Okay.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.220]   Now, there's a TikTok channel I'd watch.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:37.420]   She should go up to other people.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.380]   I'm still not watching it, but that was good that she shared that.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.940]   Now, Jessica says we just moved in today.
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.940]   That's why there's no one.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.940]   I did, but it's true.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   But she was appreciative of Jessica.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:47.940]   That's great.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:48.940]   And she's saying it.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:52.780]   By the way, as with TikTok, you have to say with the sound of the source of the sound
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:58.860]   is his original sound, Jessica Housman, which is not true because it was the other person.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.860]   Kelsey.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:07.180]   After the success of this, Kelsey started her own TikTok account under the handle Queen
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:10.660]   of consent where she adds.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.820]   Oh, sorry.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:17.300]   Keep going where she has.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:21.180]   The reason she knows the safety concerns like house number she used to work in red's life
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.620]   and student affairs, she has crisis management experience.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.620]   Oh, great.
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.620]   Nice.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:32.020]   Is that TikTok handle a dig on the fact that that woman posted a video of her without
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.020]   her consent?
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.020]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.020]   Maybe.
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:36.020]   That's why that was my guess.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.020]   I was like, oh, drama.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:43.140]   I'm going to get legitimate drama because I would be so pissed if I were in someone's viral
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:44.660]   video for just doing my job.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.780]   I didn't ask her permission to run it on the show here.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:48.780]   Let's run it again.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.780]   I thought it was quite.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.220]   That was quite entertaining.
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.780]   That was really good.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:53.780]   Here she comes.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:54.780]   She's walking.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:55.780]   No, but where's the line?
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:56.780]   Hello Jennifer.
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:57.780]   I hope your mom is going well.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:08.740]   You have no markers on your house and says what number you are.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.140]   And that is hard to find your house, my dude.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.140]   And it's unsafe, honestly.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:17.580]   If you needed a medical assistance and the paramedics didn't know your town well.
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:22.620]   I think that's, you know, I love it.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:23.620]   That is awesome.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:28.060]   That doesn't matter about, I mean, who owns that video?
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.220]   Jessica says she owns it because it's on her doorbell.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.300]   On her doorbell on her front step, her property.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.300]   Yeah, her property.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.300]   Where's the line?
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:39.860]   I mean, this is not, this is an etiquette issue.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.300]   I don't think this is a legal issue.
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.300]   Wow, there you go.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.300]   It's an etiquette issue.
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.300]   Well, it's the, you know, the adicatic issue.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.300]   And the camera.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.300]   The camera.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.620]   Well, the bonobo said that selfies in the camera.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.060]   Kelsey's not exactly a bonobo.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060]   I mean, she's a human being.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.060]   You can be.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:01.820]   Well, so if you, now it's, we're an animal human video time line 121.
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:05.580]   I debated putting this up because it's really actually pretty frightening.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.540]   The strange tale of the freedom phone?
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.540]   Oh, alligator, he's thrown.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:13.140]   Her numbers and my numbers do not correspond, I might add.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:14.140]   Well, how is that?
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.140]   I'll just refresh.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   We're in the same Google Doc.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.140]   What?
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.580]   Yeah, thank man.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.060]   Geez, what's the problem?
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.060]   I'm not going to see about that.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:26.100]   They're trying to get close up of the air.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.100]   Oh, geez.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.100]   Oh my god, he's eating it.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.980]   So they were flying a drone, in case all you heard is screams.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:38.580]   They're flying a drone up to get a picture of the alligator and he ate it.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.500]   Oh, no.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.500]   It's a little smoky.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.180]   It's really kind of, it's alligator pool.
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.940]   Actually, yeah, because there's a lithium ion battery.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.540]   You can't even buy it on battery.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.260]   Apparently the alligator doesn't mind.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.260]   He just submerges it.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.260]   Oh my god.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:51.260]   Oh, shit.
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.260]   What are you doing?
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:53.260]   Don't eat that.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.260]   George, no.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:57.260]   They've named it already in part two.
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:58.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.260]   Oh my god, shit.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.260]   Big girl out here.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:01.820]   Okay, so kids do not fly drones.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:02.820]   They're not fly drones.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:06.300]   Well, you're not supposed to fly drones over wild animals anywhere.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.300]   They hate it.
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.300]   It's true.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.300]   It's true.
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.300]   Boy.
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:13.180]   I know you're making fun of me, but I do.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.180]   No, I agree.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.180]   I'm not making fun of you.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.180]   I found this disturbing.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.180]   I found the videos.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.180]   They almost killed that alligator.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:24.020]   Of course, it might make you feel better to know that the alligator were to kill them
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:25.580]   if they got close to it.
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.420]   So it's kind of, you know, as it should, as it should.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:29.660]   They're in the alligators turf.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.180]   See, this is the same as Jessica's camera.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.180]   That's the alligator.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.580]   Time to get alligator space.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.780]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.780]   Time.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.980]   Did I do, oh, my ads?
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:42.980]   No.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:43.980]   No, another ad.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.540]   And then, no, no, I should do the, no, no, let me think.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.340]   Let's do the changelog and then I'll do an ad and then we'll wrap this up because it's
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:54.140]   getting close to waffle time.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.140]   The Google changelog.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:03.300]   Oh, as Google been busy this week, mostly having to do with enterprise stuff.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:08.300]   Google has debuted a new feature in some many features in meat, including
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.420]   companion mode.
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:12.500]   This is across workspace.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:17.420]   It's business tools, formerly known as G Suite.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.540]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.540]   There's meat calling.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.540]   There's enhanced search.
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:23.500]   There's live translated captions in meat.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.460]   All in one video conferencing devices from Logitech and Avocor.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:32.900]   Let's start with spaces, which I think this is what they announced at Google I/O.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:37.100]   Dashboards for real time project collaboration.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   These can may be made discoverable in search.
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:44.180]   They integrate multiple tools, calendar drive, docs, sheets, slides, meat and tasks.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:50.820]   One document with, kind of like Google Wave with modules for all of this in the single
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:55.940]   document with spaces says Google teams can share ideas, collaborate on documents and
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:41:01.460]   manage tasks from a single place because all their work is preserved for future reference.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:05.820]   Team members can easily jump in and contribute at a time that works best for them.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.180]   I like this.
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:09.060]   I could see using this.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:16.420]   Seeing a full history of conversations, context and content along the way.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:21.420]   Workspaces is also getting a unified dashboard with access to inboxes, chats, meetings and
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:25.860]   in line topic threading.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.860]   Meat experiences.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:30.580]   New meat experiences on the meat side.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:34.620]   Google's rolling out meat calling on both mobile and desktop devices.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:40.340]   You can actually make a phone call from within Gmail or other works.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.500]   The sound like what you're going to have Thursday with that prime rib.
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.340]   A phone call within meat?
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.740]   No, meat experience.
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:49.020]   M-E-E-T, yeah.
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.020]   Meat sweats.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.020]   Sounds funny.
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:52.660]   It's a man to me.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:57.140]   Meat allows workspace users to call members of the team directly from a one to one chat
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.140]   ring.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:02.240]   Their device is running in the Gmail app and forwarding calls to Gmail running in their
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.240]   web browser.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.240]   Wow.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:09.100]   Next month, or actually November, companion mode will come to meat.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.020]   Let users host or join meetings from within a conference room using a laptop while tapping
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.060]   the in-room audio and video.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:23.700]   So you're in a presentation room and you, I don't know, some sort of hybrid thing with
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:27.900]   your laptop and the presentation hardware.
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:32.060]   Accompanying companion mode of live translated captions feature, which will be available and
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:37.880]   meet by the end of the year, English to French, German, Spanish and Portuguese.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.680]   There also is, there are going to be some new meat boards.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:48.680]   Meat, like whiteboard kind of things.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.520]   There's the series one desk, a 27 inch all in one device.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.680]   The series one board.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:56.200]   Oh no, none of these are.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:02.940]   65 inch 4K display that has an optional stand, both made by Avocore.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.560]   And this is, you remember the Jamboard?
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.600]   This is going to have the Jamboard app in it.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.640]   So it's, I guess just another manufacturer of a Jamboard like device.
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.120]   They'll also, but the Jamboard, they're delighted to call.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120]   Right.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.860]   Yeah, this has a camera on it.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:25.720]   You can add the Logitech rally bar, mini and rally bar, the raise rally pro, which is
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.400]   a mobile device speaker doc.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.240]   I guess these are speakers.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.240]   Wow.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.040]   Hey, if you send me one of those, I'll do the next twig for my deck.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.040]   That'd be cool.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:41.400]   I wish we could afford to hear that because these would be really cool to have.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400]   They are expensive.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.120]   Although, you know, because businesses save an average of $11,000 per halftime telecommuter
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.240]   a year, that pays for it.
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.240]   It says Google.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240]   Fine.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240]   There we go.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.240]   Hmm.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.560]   So this is the, here's the CNET.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.560]   See, I saw it added in the first thing I would also.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.640]   My line was mobile device management from the IT department.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.960]   Yeah, sure.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.760]   Look at this.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.560]   So this is the 27 inch.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:12.200]   It's basically a $2,000 monitor, but you can use it also.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.040]   I was going to say, can I draw it though?
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.560]   And like, because think about how if I could explain like spectrum management or things
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560]   like by drawing stuff.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.560]   Yeah, it's a whiteboard.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.560]   You can see it.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:21.560]   That would be fun.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.560]   Oh, I actually have a whiteboard.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.720]   Yeah, but this one's hooked up to the me.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.720]   Not surprised.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.720]   2000 bucks.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.760]   You have a whiteboard in your office?
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760]   Everyone should have a whiteboard.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.760]   I do.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.760]   Lots of whiteboards.
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.760]   I have this.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.760]   Yes.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.760]   We've seen your collection.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:37.760]   He's got a piece of paper.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.760]   I have that too.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.360]   No pricing for the 65 inch.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:48.040]   Google workspace has acquired play space, a video, screen share and whiteboard collaboration
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.080]   tool.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.040]   This is all about work from home.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.040]   It's a piece of whiteboards.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.680]   Work from home's coming back, isn't it?
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.560]   Or remote meetings.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:03.720]   All these companies who thought shoot, we missed the boat with Zoom, have a second chance
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.720]   now.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]   Oh, good.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   Who knows?
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.720]   We don't have to come to work anymore.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:09.720]   Google.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.720]   Oh, okay.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.800]   Spaces were Google rooms.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.720]   So that's where spaces came from.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.880]   Again, the worst brand new company on earth.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]   I know.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.880]   I don't know what it is.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   Chrome OS.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.160]   People have gone in every name since they've just screwed up.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.040]   Chrome OS 93 will appear on your Chromebook today.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.760]   I don't see it yet.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   It's a, you know, Chrome 93 came out to mobile and desktop last week.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   So it just took a little longer.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760]   You'd think it'd come to the Chromebook first.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.560]   Why the hell because Google abuses those it loves.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   Right.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.480]   Google's rolling out beta five, Vandroid 12.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:52.360]   This is the release candidate means we're getting close to the release for the pixel.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:57.080]   I would guess for the pixel six and other phones as well.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.320]   Android 12 beta five.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.440]   You could put it on your pixels including I think now the five a fight with 5G.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.960]   So that's yeah, that's Germany will be the, it will be the pixel sex.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]   Sex.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:11.960]   Sex.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.960]   Cosses.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   Right.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:22.240]   The, also the September security patches rolling out.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.580]   So in the factory images and OTAs are live.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:27.680]   So check your phone, especially if you have a Google phone.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.280]   You should be getting an update very soon.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.520]   And Google clock is broken.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:42.040]   This is actually a warning because the alarms are broken leading to a flurry of one star
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.040]   placed or reviews.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.600]   Nothing worse than when an alarm doesn't go off.
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:53.600]   I mean, that's I don't remember last time I used an alarm, but I can see why that would
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:54.840]   aggravate people.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.480]   So this is a problem.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.080]   This is from Reddit posted by rip tire 21 PSA.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.640]   If you're currently using an alarm and have it set to use Spotify, switch back to system
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.480]   sounds until an update is released.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.200]   Oh, so that's the problem.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.720]   Oh, it's the Spotify integration?
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.920]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.420]   Oh, well.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:20.440]   And then of course, somebody immediately came in and said, is there any fix for the Pixel
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.640]   3 devices stuck in EDL mode?
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:29.920]   That's been an increasing, growing problem of people's Pixel 3 is being bricked.
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.440]   Bricked.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.920]   Planned obsolescence.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:38.920]   Well, is the EDL mode is, you know, normally you would hook it up to a computer to get
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.920]   it fixed, but it's not working.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.840]   So it's kind of unclear what's going on here.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.000]   People basically have broken Pixel 3s.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.040]   Google has confirmed the issue.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.280]   Three and three Excel smartphones are bricking, but Google says it has nothing else to share
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.280]   for now.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.880]   In other words, I'm sure they're trying to figure out what the heck's going on.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.120]   EDL is the emergency download mode.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:08.080]   In theory, you'd connect it to a computer and download a new firmware.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:13.720]   And that's built into the Qualcomm chips, but it's not working.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.720]   It's not working.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.120]   Users are confirming the devices are in EDL mode, but plugging them into computers, they
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:26.240]   see a device ID that says QUSB, bulk CID, followed by their serial numbers.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.080]   Many of these devices can be charged, but the screens remain unresponsive.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.880]   It's not clear why this is happening.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.920]   Google's investigating.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.240]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.000]   Second, Google change log.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:51.360]   I want to see how we can make the show title.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.760]   We could call the show KPI.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.880]   I don't know.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.720]   We'll have to work on that one.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.880]   And then we shall return with your picks of the week.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.200]   How about that, kids?
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.440]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa, the address experts.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.880]   You know, addresses go bad.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.160]   They go bad actually surprisingly fast.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:23.120]   According to the US Postal Service, there were 36 million change of address forms processed
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.440]   in 2020.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.560]   That's 36 million customers who got a new address.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.880]   And that doesn't even reflect new emails, new phone numbers, changes and names.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:38.560]   Making customer address data be accurate is critical for your business.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.320]   So maybe you want to update it.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.720]   According to Melissa, 30% of customer data goes bad every year.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.360]   Melissa's job to make sure your data is current and accurate.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.200]   And they've been doing it for 35 years.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.480]   10,000 businesses trust Melissa, the address experts.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.680]   And boy, once you start using Melissa, you'll never want to let it go.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.080]   Melissa has a renewal rate of over 92%.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.120]   Proof that companies love Melissa, you will too.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.000]   Not just addresses, you can verify emails, phone numbers and names.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.120]   And you can do it in a variety of ways.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.520]   There's an on-prem solution.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.880]   It's very flexible.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.120]   There's a web service.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.200]   You could even upload to their secure FTP site, download a cleaned list.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.120]   They offer software as a service delivery.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:28.000]   There's even an API, which means you can incorporate this into your own applications,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.520]   giving you real-time corrections for addresses and emails and phone numbers and names.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:39.760]   Melissa's global address verification service verifies addresses in over 240 countries and
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.320]   territories as they're being entered.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.080]   And by the way, it also can fix duplicates.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:49.760]   If you have duplicates in your database, and I think everybody does, that's wasting
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.760]   time and money by sending out duplicate mailers or catalogs.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.000]   And Melissa's data matching capabilities will help you eliminate clutter and duplicates
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.040]   increase the accuracy of your database and reduce postage and mailing costs.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:07.320]   You can even add customer demographic info to your records, such as marital status or
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.920]   social media handles.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:10.920]   Very flexible.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.520]   They even have new apps now on iOS and Android.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:19.800]   The Lookups apps, which will help you search addresses, names and more at your fingertips,
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.920]   that's very cool because you can verify and address if you're concerned.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:26.840]   Melissa's very careful, by the way, to protect your data.
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:32.080]   They undergo continuous independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.600]   security, privacy and compliance.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.960]   They're SOC2 HIPAA GDPR compliant.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:43.040]   And if you ever have a question, they've got the best support ever, 24/7, world-renowned
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.040]   support.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.880]   As long as you sign up for a service level agreement, they're there to help you.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.040]   Most inquire about that today at the Melissa Global Support Center.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.040]   They're still supporting communities and qualifying essential workers during the pandemic.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.840]   If your organization qualifies, you can get six months of free service.
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:02.360]   Go to Melissa.com and find out.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.160]   And also some hearty congratulations to Melissa.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:11.000]   They've been named a leader in address verification and data quality by G2 Crowd in their Spring
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.520]   2021 report.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:15.680]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:17.400]   Try Melissa's APIs.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.440]   In the Developer Portal, it's easy to log on, sign up and start playing in the API sandbox.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.480]   Yeah, they have a great API.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.480]   24/7.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.120]   In fact, you can get started today with 1,000 records clean free.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.040]   Go to Melissa.com/twit.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:35.800]   Thank you so much, Melissa, for your support of this week in Google.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:40.360]   And thank you, dear, tweaked listeners, for going to that special address to let them
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.600]   know you saw it here.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:47.040]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:53.080]   And now the Queen of Consent, Stacey Higginbotham's Pick for the Week.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.120]   Oh, your microphone's off.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:57.120]   I hope you're muted.
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.120]   Sorry.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:00.920]   It's because I ran down to get my thing of the week.
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:06.560]   I think I talked about this on this weekend tech maybe, but I don't think I've done it
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.560]   here.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.560]   So apologies if you've seen this.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:11.800]   A couple of weeks ago, I said I was testing the Swarm Eval Kit.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:20.360]   This is a $499 satellite dev kit to test Swarm $60 a year satellite IoT service.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.280]   So I have been testing it.
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:26.960]   This is intermittent service, small packets, and this is my kit.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.960]   Oh, look.
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:28.960]   So this is the solar panel.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:29.960]   There it is.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.960]   It's the back.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.400]   It's decent to level it up.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.080]   Can you put this outside?
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:36.160]   Yes, it's been living outside.
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.160]   It's water-proof.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.160]   It's absolute outside.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.720]   It's a little bit too easy.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.720]   It does need to live outside.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.240]   I can't flip it over very adequately here.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.840]   But see back here.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.040]   All right, this is the tripod's getting in my way here.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.800]   That can you see the Swarm Eval Kit?
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.200]   A little tile.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.200]   Yeah, yep.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.920]   All right, so this is the thing of the week.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:53:59.920]   I've been testing it.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:05.720]   So you get, you know, this is not constant connectivity.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.840]   It will be once every hour at least.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.600]   Right now, some hours go by without a satellite hitting my neck of the woods.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.920]   But it's still really fun.
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.240]   So what would you use it for?
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:19.840]   Because you only get 751-way data packets a month.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.320]   So people use it for sensors like--
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.320]   Ah, out in the forest.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.520]   Like you get Bluetooth sensor to this and you get like, do you need to water your plants?
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.080]   Or someone else is using it for a device that's a service called Boat Secure.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.360]   And it's basically letting people know if someone's like messing with their boat.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]   There's lots of--
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.360]   Can you send images?
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.360]   They're very small packets.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:41.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.360]   It's just text.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.600]   Yeah, this is just text or time series data.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.880]   I mean, but there's a lot of demand for stuff like this.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.480]   And $60 a year is not a lot.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.280]   That's $5 a month.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:57.800]   So and this Eval Kit is expensive because it, you know, comes with a solar panel.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.040]   It comes with a featherweight board.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.160]   It comes with all this stuff.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.160]   But yeah.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:08.640]   So the messages go through the satellite or they go through your-- I guess they do.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.320]   So they have satellites.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.240]   Swarm has satellites.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.240]   Swarm has, yes.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.000]   Swarm has a couple thousand satellites.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   Oh, wow.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.480]   Maybe a couple hundred, I can't remember.
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:23.000]   They're the company just so you know, Swarm was recently bought by SpaceX.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.760]   Oh, that's right.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:25.760]   That's why we were talking about--
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.600]   You're like, oh, I have heard about them.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.600]   No, I remember.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:29.600]   Yes, so this is that company.
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.600]   I'm talking about them, I remember.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.040]   So I have ordered SpaceX.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.880]   I don't know if it'll-- when it'll come, there's a waiting list.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.360]   But I ordered Starlink.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.800]   SpaceX is Starlink because I'm very curious how that will work out.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.360]   For that, you have to have a clear line of sight.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.160]   Does the Swarm require-- does it work with its trees?
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.600]   You do need-- I mean, trees are going to cause some problems.
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:57.800]   This isn't a bad-- like, I have trees, but I managed to find a good spot where I did--
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:58.800]   like, it's not that crazy.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.080]   I'm a little nervous, actually, now that I've-- I don't know where I'm going to put the dish.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.080]   Does she make dish face?
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:07.080]   I don't know.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.640]   I guess I have to get up on the roof and put up a TV antenna rod because it needs to be
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.640]   high in the end.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.160]   I feel like you should please make sure we have video if you don't like this.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.160]   Oh, you will definitely.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:18.160]   Yeah, you will.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.160]   Definitely.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.160]   Dorff.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:26.920]   Just for you, I'll put my knees and my sandals and I'll do it up.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:27.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.240]   A door from the roof, just for you.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.560]   All right, cool.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.560]   Swarm.
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:36.840]   So this is a somewhat specialized thing, but if you knew--
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.840]   Yes.
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:42.280]   You need to send location data or some sort of textual data.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.840]   That's pretty cool.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.880]   Yeah, it's cool because it's satellite, so it's everywhere.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.880]   Right.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:49.880]   So yeah.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:53.040]   Yeah, it's cheaper than-- how much a month?
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.040]   60 bucks a month?
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.040]   It's $5 a month.
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.040]   $5.60 a year.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.040]   Oh, that's not it?
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.720]   Yeah, it's super cheap.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.160]   Like for-- at that price, I mean, if I had a couple of Bluetooth sensors in my yard,
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.520]   it'd be worth it, you know?
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.520]   That just couldn't access Wi-Fi.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.520]   Right.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.520]   I think.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.320]   Would you put it on your mailbox to let you know in the mail's here?
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.120]   No, because I don't really care what my mail's here.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.120]   But maybe my husband--
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.120]   There's nothing in the mail anymore.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120]   It's like the phone.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.120]   I know, it's true, isn't it?
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.120]   Well, I get lots of good things in the mail.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.600]   I love catalogs, y'all.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.600]   I get pack-a-loves.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.600]   I get pack-a-loves.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.600]   I think I get pack-a-loves.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   I get my pack packages.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.600]   Let's do a number with Jeff John.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:29.600]   So I guess--
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:30.600]   So I guess--
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.600]   So I guess I'm all home.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.600]   Oh, I'll do--
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600]   Oh.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:34.600]   --swarmed.space, I should mention.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:35.600]   Swarmed.space.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   I'll do one related.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   You've been wanting to test Starlink, right?
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.600]   Yes.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.600]   So Tom Evislin has tested it.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:44.280]   Let me explain who Tom Evislin is first, because he's a very important character.
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:50.200]   Tom was the founder of ITXC, which was a major VoIP company.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:55.960]   And before that was the person who created WorldNet at AT&T, and he's the guy who took
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:58.800]   the clock off the internet.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.880]   Before Tom, there was no unlimited.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.160]   You always-- you paid by the minute.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:03.160]   Your parents were after you.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:04.160]   Are you still on that internet thing?
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.160]   Give me a call of caution.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.760]   Oh, thank you, Tom.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.520]   And Tom is the guy who changed the world and took the clock off the internet.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.520]   Tom is a real leader.
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:12.520]   He's an amazing guy.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:13.520]   He's a friend.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.520]   I haven't talked to him, but he's a friend.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.520]   He's a great guy.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.000]   So anyway, he is also-- I think he is the chief technology officer of Vermont.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]   And other things up there.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000]   He lives up there.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]   I know him.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000]   Sorry.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000]   This is-- I remember this scenario.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000]   Yes, he's a great guy.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000]   Yes.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000]   He's a great guy.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000]   Brilliant.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]   Brilliant.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.400]   So Tom's a wife and brother of Vermont, and they have to deal with the problems of being
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.400]   remote with connectivity.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:39.680]   He finally got fiber, but he's connected.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:42.400]   He had a terrible DSL, so he finally fixed all that.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:46.000]   But he wanted to compare Starlink Beta versus fiber.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.200]   And the fiber, we know what that is.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:54.880]   The Starlink, he was getting 75 to 200 down.
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:59.720]   It could go as low as 40, but as high as 325.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:01.920]   The average, he says, is probably about 125 down.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:07.840]   Upload varies between 8 and 15.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   The latency as a rule is running 45 to 60 MS.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.400]   Microsecond, then what is that?
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.400]   Microseconds, yeah.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   No, let's take it.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:18.400]   No, let's take it.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.400]   Microseconds.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.400]   Microseconds.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.400]   Oh, it was fun.
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:26.440]   So, but the loaded latency that is the same as you actually use it for something like Zoom
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.440]   is running 300.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.800]   So it won't work.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:29.800]   That's not great.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:30.800]   We're Twitch.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:32.800]   Right?
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:33.800]   What's your high end for latency?
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.520]   Oh, I guess we could deal with 300, which is a third of a second.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.520]   Really?
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:40.520]   That's what we could deal with that.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:41.520]   I would like to see it happen.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.520]   You had to do that with me in hotels, or in other words?
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:43.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:44.520]   It's not unusual.
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.520]   Anytime.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:49.000]   In fact, what happens all the time, we'll have guests on who you could tell the latency
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.480]   is terrible because they'll start talking and while somebody else is talking, we're
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.640]   all asking a question and there's a delay.
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.880]   And it can often be almost a second.
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.520]   I think that happens.
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:01.000]   Right, John, do we keep track of latency?
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.720]   Yeah, Renee's late.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.720]   He's very late.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.680]   I've always thought.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.440]   It's Blame Canada.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.840]   It's funny because--
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.840]   Rogers.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:18.480]   It's funny because Tom says we're heavy zoomers, which in fact upstream and latency are very
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.480]   important for us.
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.480]   Oh, port.
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:21.480]   Right.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.480]   He says it's kind of tolerable.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.480]   He can live with it.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.480]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.840]   This is about what I've seen and expect for myself as well.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.120]   Starlink has frequent-- it says it generally stays up, but about 10 per hour, the latency
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.720]   will spike for five seconds or more.
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:36.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.440]   That's unusable.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:42.400]   So his fiber connection is $131 a month.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.240]   Starlink is $99 a month.
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:49.000]   Starlink can't cost $600 with taxes and shipping.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.800]   Pretty much installed itself, though he has Tom Epsilon, the expert in all things communications.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.880]   And you can't really get it now.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:58.280]   But out of curiosity, I thought that was--
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.720]   You know, so you pay $100 to get in line, which I've done.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:06.320]   And I don't know when I'll get it.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.080]   You know, they're slowly rolling out.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:16.080]   They're calling it-- he says the better than nothing beta.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.080]   So it won't be--
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.320]   That's on us to advertise it.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.840]   No, Elon's good at that.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.760]   Despite what Amazon says about him, did you see what Amazon said about Elon Musk?
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.760]   Wow.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.200]   Oh, this is just getting vicious.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.200]   Is it space boy?
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.200]   Is that war?
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.200]   Yes.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   You tell, do you?
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.840]   I'll tell you a second.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.960]   Amazon slams SpaceX.
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:41.960]   And not just to anybody.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:47.160]   They told the FCC that the Musk companies are rule breakers.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.880]   Here's the quote.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.560]   This is-- they sent this to the FCC.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:57.720]   "Whether it's launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval,
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:02.640]   building an unapproved launch tower, or reopening a factory in violation of shelter in place
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.160]   order, the conduct of SpaceX and other musculid companies.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:10.040]   Makes their view plain rules are for other people.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:16.320]   And those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:19.680]   and ad hominem attacks."
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:23.040]   So let me tell you, this is the satellite industry.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:24.040]   They're vicious.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.600]   These people hold nothing back.
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.880]   Their comments to the FCC are usually excellent.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.520]   The lobbyists in the space do-- like, swarm and orbcom are fighting over the use of the
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:41.960]   same spectrum, orbcoms, letters to the FCC, accuse swarm of doing very similar things.
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:45.560]   This was pre- Musk buying them.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.960]   Although maybe they were twins.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:53.560]   Although Sarah is Canadian, so I can't imagine her not abiding by rules.
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:03:01.480]   Anyway, the point is, satellite-- those people are pirates.
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.480]   They're amazing.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.480]   It's so fun.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:04.480]   Yeah, so--
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:12.240]   SpaceX is not held back ensuing other companies like Microsoft when they can't compete.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:18.120]   In fact, SpaceX's response is, Amazon frequently tries to hinder competitors to, quote, "compensate
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.840]   for Amazon's failure to make progress of its own."
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:28.520]   Amazon's trying to torpedo SpaceX's request for the next generation of Starlink satellites.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:31.760]   They want to launch-- now, last time I saw it, it was 12,000.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:37.320]   Amazon says 30,000 broadband satellites.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.560]   So yeah, it's vicious.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.720]   It's vicious.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.800]   In today's filing, Amazon said it's making its response to SpaceX with a, quote, "with
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.680]   a sigh."
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.560]   A heavy sigh.
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.480]   You know, they're not fully wrong in this.
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.440]   I mean, I don't-- anyway.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.440]   Interesting battle.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.120]   And it's-- not-- Amazon's gotten very feisty under Andy Jassy.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.200]   They're aggressive.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.200]   I will let you know.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.960]   I'm actually supportive of Starlink because the notion of high-speed internet access available
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.200]   to every corner of the globe is very intriguing.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:22.160]   Admittedly, it's very expensive right now, but they've said they'll be able to get the
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.160]   price down.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.280]   In fact, they've got new satellites-- or new dishes coming that are less expensive.
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.280]   So we shall see.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:33.440]   We shall see.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.520]   Ant?
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.880]   Was that a number?
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.040]   That was just your-- there's a lot of numbers.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.840]   There were a lot of numbers of numbers of numbers of numbers.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.840]   What was the give you a quote?
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:42.840]   There was microseconds.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.840]   There was microseconds.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:49.200]   I will give you the link to Tom Abslin's blog.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.280]   It's Tom Abslin.com, E-V-S-L-I-N.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:54.440]   It's called Fractals of Change.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:55.440]   Nothing--
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.440]   I just mentioned--
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:57.440]   Yes.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:58.440]   His subtitle.
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:01.160]   I'm interested this week, and I won't go into them anyway.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.400]   But Amazon is now shipping cargo for others outside of Amazon.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.400]   Not a surprise.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:09.160]   That's really much like the AWS strategy.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:12.960]   I found that interesting.
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:18.720]   Visio got $100 million in upfront advertising.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:19.720]   Your TV.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.840]   Yeah, this is not surprising as well.
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:29.160]   LG pushed an update to my LG TV that started to show ads and all sorts of stuff.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.040]   Then I got another update yesterday that took it all back.
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.680]   So I wonder if there's a little heat from a lot.
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.680]   Do you want to do it too?
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.480]   Did it show it even like-- is it like your Kindle?
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.320]   Like even when it's not how it shows ads?
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.320]   When you first turn on the TV, there's little pop-up ads.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:46.120]   And in some of the user interface, there's little pop-up ads.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.280]   And that's not sure what Visio is-- yeah, I'm sure that-- well, I'm sure that's what
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.480]   Visio is doing.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:54.360]   They also know what you watch and who you are and the thing about it.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.360]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:58.040]   I mean, it's not merely that Visio is showing ads.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:03.600]   I wonder-- I mean, I don't know that $100 million if it goes to also purchasing customer
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:09.200]   viewing information because there's a lot of that coming from these smart TVs.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.200]   Visio ads was created--
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:14.120]   And what I would have talked about, but I wanted to be in harmony with Stacey and do
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:15.120]   connectivity.
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.240]   Visio-- Oh, I think this stuff is horrifying.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:21.640]   I wrote-- like, canoe ventures was a Comcast ventures effort to do something similar to
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.840]   this back in 2008.
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:27.480]   And I wrote one of the most excruciating pieces of my career on that.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.320]   Here, just excruciating.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.320]   Excruciating.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.800]   Is that not how you say the word?
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:32.800]   Or excoriating.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:33.800]   Excruciating.
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.320]   Oh, I can't say the word.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:38.880]   It was excruciating for her as she excoriated those horrible--
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:43.240]   It's excruciating for them because she excoriated them.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.240]   There we go.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:45.240]   Excruciating.
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.240]   So tight.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:54.240]   Here is Visio's come on to advertisers from Visio ads, the direct to device advertising
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:57.120]   platform built for the future of TV.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.120]   What does a Visio ad look like?
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:04.240]   The heartbeat of the home, where our audience is the core of innovation.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.240]   That was such a--
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:07.240]   Yes, language.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.240]   Nothing.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:11.240]   Heartbeat of the home, where our audience is the core.
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:16.000]   That's like the poetry I used to write in, like, high school for my teachers who loved
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000]   that stuff.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.480]   Now they just told you they loved it.
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.480]   Every niche.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.480]   I hate to--
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:22.480]   Every demographic.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:23.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.920]   Every red solo cup.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:26.920]   Using data.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.920]   Oh, to drive relevancy.
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.760]   Yeah, innovative ad formats.
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:35.960]   Yeah, so in a way, that's how they're selling the information they gather is, you know, they're
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.560]   saying, look, we can put that pizza ad right in front of somebody about to watch a football
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.560]   game.
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:42.400]   I'm really pissed my pizza place got rid of--
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.440]   For audience verification, manage frequency.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:49.480]   Yes, see, this is why it's hard to sell podcast advertising.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.920]   Oh, by the way, did you see that?
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.320]   The audiences will be happier.
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.720]   So it's all good.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.720]   Everybody wins.
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.720]   Nobody's excruciating.
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:00.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.920]   Second by second content recognition.
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.000]   Wow.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.360]   This is them saying telling advertisers they know everything about what I'm watching on
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:12.360]   their Vizier TV.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:14.960]   Is that a plot patrol on one of them?
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:15.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:16.960]   Plot patrol.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.800]   They're not supposed to do that with kids.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.800]   Wow.
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:22.680]   Well, maybe it's an adult who owns the TV.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:23.680]   Maybe.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:24.680]   Yeah.
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:27.840]   Mr. Emperor, pick of the week, my friend.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:32.880]   Well, since y'all were talking about Starlink, I figure I'd throw one more Starlink reference
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:33.960]   out there.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.560]   And that's with our co-hosts of Floss Weekly.
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:38.880]   Mr. Jonathan Bennett.
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:46.800]   I believe he's a Starlink user there in Oklahoma, and he does the show over that connection.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:54.440]   In episode 638 of Floss Weekly, they had David Tatt on, Dave Tatt.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.800]   And he talked a lot about--
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.800]   Mr. Buffer Bloat.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:57.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:08:58.800]   Buffer Bloat.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:08:59.800]   And he talked about conversations with--
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.800]   He's on a boat.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:05.320]   And he was on a dad gum boat doing the show.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.320]   It was such a cool show.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.320]   Buffer?
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.320]   Bloat from the boat.
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.960]   What kind of internet did he have?
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:11.560]   Where did he get his internet?
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.560]   He didn't say.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:14.120]   That's pretty good for a boat.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:15.120]   But he was doing it all about it.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.120]   There's Jonathan.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:18.000]   Yeah, he's on a Starlink.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000]   It's pretty cool.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000]   Yeah.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.880]   In fact, it was his positive experience with the Starlink that kind of encouraged me to
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.160]   take a chance myself.
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.600]   It's also because Lisa said we have to have a backup if Comcast goes down.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:30.600]   Of course.
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:31.600]   Yeah.
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:35.760]   And he's also the host of the untitled "Lennet Show" that's available to our club, Twit
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:37.760]   and Bruce's excellent program.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:38.760]   Highly recommended.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:39.760]   Highly recommended.
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.400]   And that's every Saturday.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:42.400]   Yep.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.400]   Right after the gizfiz.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:44.400]   That's right.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:46.800]   But yeah, that was my first thought.
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:50.760]   But my pick of the week is "World Travel Man" on Amazon.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:53.680]   It's "World Travel Man" in 48 hours.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:57.040]   Hosted by Mr. Richard Iuwide.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.680]   I've talked about him before in his book "A View From the Top" and where he talked about
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:03.920]   the movie "A View From the Top."
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:10.080]   But this is him just going around and traveling in 48 hours at different destinations, just
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.320]   providing his own little bit of wit and a shout out to our listener, Miss Leanne, who
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:23.520]   put this on my radar because it's quite hilarious, especially the Turkey visit.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.520]   Look at this.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.520]   It's quite Turkish.
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.280]   Here's a button that says "Create a watch party to watch and chat with others."
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.920]   If you have friends who are Amazon Prime subscribers, you can watch the show together.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:34.920]   There's the QR code.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:36.760]   That's a new feature they've done.
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:37.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:38.760]   Never notice that.
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.760]   Sorry to watch.
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.760]   But then again, I do that from television.
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:43.560]   So you no longer have to be like, "Okay, press play, right?"
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:44.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:45.560]   Right.
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:46.560]   No.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.560]   Right.
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:50.320]   You know, my Apple was supposed to release a similar product and decided it's not ready
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.320]   for prime time yet.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.720]   So we'll keep--stay tuned.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:58.040]   And then of course, we've got to promote your Instagram.
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:10:59.040]   Yeah.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.520]   Go on Instagram, @int_proit.
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.920]   I'm still putting some stuff over there.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.920]   Fairly.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.920]   Regularly.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.400]   I know we talked about Glass.photo and I'm done with that.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.880]   You didn't like it, huh?
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:15.440]   It's just not doing anything for me.
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:19.600]   And they released the statements and they're going to work on some more stuff for the community
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:20.720]   aspect of it.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:23.560]   And I don't know.
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:24.760]   I'll give it some time.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.040]   My account is still there, but I'm not paying at $5 anymore.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.520]   I've already got there last time.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.200]   I already got my last $5 payment from now for the episode.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.200]   I bought it for years.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:35.200]   I'm still there.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.200]   Nice.
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.200]   Nice.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.200]   Very good.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:39.200]   Thank you, @proit.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:50.520]   Go to twit.tv/hop to watch the ladies' hands-on photography episodes.
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.640]   Catch up, @proit_proit on Instagram.
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:58.440]   And of course, you can catch up with him in our friendly Discord.
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.160]   He is our Twit Club Twit community manager.
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:09.120]   Highly recommend a visit to Club Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:10.640]   They know when we're looking at them.
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:11.920]   The best, Jeff's ever.
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:14.320]   They can tell we're looking at them.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:18.520]   When you pay seven bucks a month for Club Twit, you get ad-free versions of all of our shows,
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.960]   which cuts the listening time in half.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.040]   It only seems that way.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:28.480]   You also get access to the Discord, which is a lot of fun.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:29.680]   Every show has its own channel.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:30.920]   There's a video stream.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.560]   There's audio streams.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:39.960]   And there's discussion groups about all kinds of geeky subjects from anime to hacking.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.960]   To even to sports.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.040]   Yes, we had a sports ball.
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.480]   Sports and sports ball.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:46.480]   Nice.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.440]   And space and all of that stuff.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:52.760]   And of course, you get the Twit Plus feed, which has things like the Untitled Linux show,
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.760]   The Gizfiz.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.920]   And I think we're going to be doing some more stuff.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:00.320]   We've got Micah Sargent as our very first community event on Friday.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.320]   Isn't it?
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:04.080]   Ask me anything hosted by Ant.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:05.080]   What time is that?
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:06.080]   10am?
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.560]   We will do that 10am Pacific on Friday, September 10th.
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.520]   And got some other stuff planned.
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.840]   We're going to do another one next month, but it's not going to be an ask me anything.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.360]   It's going to be a little bit different.
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:20.160]   It's going to get you involved in some of this stuff.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.840]   Yeah, Lisa and I are going to do one.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.640]   That'll be fun.
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:26.600]   All of us, in fact, Annie and everybody says they want to do it.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:30.040]   You guys are invited to Stacey and Jeff.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:32.960]   It'd be fun to have an ask me anything with Jeff Jarvis.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   He's got some stories.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.920]   That'd be a lot of fun.
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:38.000]   It's going to be fun.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000]   Professor Javus.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.480]   It's going to come in weeks and months.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:43.480]   It's going to be a lot of fun if you're a club Twit member.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:44.480]   Good.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.760]   You've got to be /club Twit, join us.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:50.560]   You support the network and I think you get your money's worth too.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:52.000]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.260]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:04.640]   Credit Card Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:06.840]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.480]   He's at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.480]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:10.480]   Thank you.
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:12.980]   Is it a kachioi pepe night?
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:13.980]   That was last week.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:14.980]   That was last week.
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:18.960]   That was the kind of artisanal pizza place nearby.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.480]   I just got rid of the pepperoni.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.480]   Oh man.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.320]   How can you have pizza with that pepperoni?
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:24.320]   What is that anyway?
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.320]   Come on.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.220]   Then the other place I was thinking about I was thinking about a nice black bean burger.
[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:30.180]   No, they're not doing that right now.
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:31.180]   What is going on here?
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:32.820]   Did you enjoy the US Open?
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:34.160]   These are the food shortages.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:35.160]   That's right.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.160]   You can't get black beans.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.540]   Well, I don't know if you're also the same guy that goes to a Taco Bell to order a chicken
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:41.540]   sandwich.
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.900]   Because I'm a American.
[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.900]   I'm a American on it.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:47.920]   That bit you go to a steakhouse in order to fish to.
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:48.920]   Right.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:49.920]   I do.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.080]   Well, the US Open, we sold the ticket we could.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.080]   We didn't go this year.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.080]   We're scared.
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:57.080]   You didn't go?
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:58.080]   You had tickets and you didn't go?
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.080]   Oh yeah.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.440]   No, we have yearly tickets in Armstrong.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.440]   I know.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:04.280]   I know you're pretty serious about it.
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:05.800]   Third row center.
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.960]   They're just great and we can go.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   Wow.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960]   I would have gone.
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:11.960]   You're all vaccinated, right?
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:15.040]   Yeah, but it's outdoors, right?
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:18.420]   I just saw my father with a breakthrough COVID.
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:19.420]   That's scary.
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:22.860]   Yeah, and then on top of that, I didn't even talk about this.
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:25.340]   The storm that was coming through the wall in the show last week.
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:26.340]   Yeah.
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:27.340]   Blood of the basement.
[02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:28.340]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.540]   At least you weren't living there.
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:31.540]   Yes.
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:33.540]   Well, I'm sorry.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:35.540]   We're lucky compared to around here.
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:37.660]   This could have been a lot worse.
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:38.660]   White lucky.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:40.980]   Yeah, it could have been a lot worse.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:43.540]   I think that's an interesting question.
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:46.200]   Should you go to outdoor events?
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:47.200]   We went to see Billie Eilert.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:48.400]   It was an outdoor concert.
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:52.500]   We wore our masks in and out and we're careful.
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.860]   We're going to go see Alanis Marsett in about three weeks at an outdoor.
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:59.860]   We're not going to indoor venues, but I feel like an outdoor venue if you were, if you're
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:02.480]   mask appropriately, I think that's all right.
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:04.580]   I'd like to go to a football game.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:05.740]   You don't want to do it?
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:07.180]   No, I would like to.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:11.020]   I would like to go, whether it's Dan at Berkeley or go to Stanford.
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.260]   I want to see some college football.
[02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:16.620]   Dr. Fauci just told us that packed stadiums are not a good idea.
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:17.620]   Oh, well.
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:18.620]   Yes.
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:21.020]   I'm just throwing that out there, y'all.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:23.260]   Even if you feel so, this is the thing.
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:27.180]   And initially we thought, if you're vaccinated, we can go back to living.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:29.620]   I know a lot of unvaccinated people are getting sick.
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:30.620]   People did it.
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:31.860]   Yes, but they don't know.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:32.860]   People did.
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:33.860]   Yeah.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:40.660]   Bill, we're still have the protection we had, whether or not others did it.
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.300]   You'll join on all the discourses.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:44.580]   Listen to Dr. Fauci.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:45.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:46.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:47.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:48.740]   I won't go to packed outdoor spaces.
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:50.900]   I will go to open outdoor spaces.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:56.780]   We went to an outdoor concert that was like, we were all part part, but I would not be,
[02:16:56.780 --> 02:17:00.500]   you know, in a traditional outdoor concert when you're, yeah.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.260]   People are walking me for risking my life to see Billie Eidel.
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:10.140]   I admit it was not my first choice, but it was nice to get out.
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:16.860]   I, you know, I feel like as if as somebody's vaccinated, yes, I could get a breakthrough
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:20.500]   infection, but it would not be life threatening or, you know, even dead.
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:24.540]   You don't know what the, what, what the long haul is.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:28.020]   My father was in hospital and rehab for weeks.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:29.020]   He's pretty old.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.020]   He's 95.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.020]   Yeah, I know.
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:33.060]   But, you know, if I were 95, I wouldn't do it.
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:36.340]   You wait a spring chicken either fell off.
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:38.340]   All right.
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:39.980]   I don't know.
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:43.980]   You're no Craig Newmark.
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:48.820]   Stacey Iggenbotham's website is Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:50.100]   Some great newsletters here.
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:51.100]   Subscribe.
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:52.980]   Learn about the event coming up too.
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:55.780]   You put it under the event tab now, right?
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:56.780]   I did.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:58.340]   It's now looking the spot.
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:00.180]   I know all about that.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:02.420]   The RF event coming up.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:06.380]   You can also hear her podcast there with Kevin Tofol, the IOT show.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.380]   Thank you.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:08.540]   Stacey, thank you, Jeff.
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:09.540]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:12.260]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:16.660]   We do this show every Wednesday, right after Windows weekly.
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:22.620]   It's usually about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:25.820]   If you want to watch live, you can at twit.tv/live.
[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:26.980]   There's audio and video there.
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:32.300]   If you're watching live chat live with us at irc.twit.tv, free and open to all.
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:36.340]   You can also, if you're a member of club, chat with us on the discourse.
[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:38.300]   Discord, I'm sorry.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:39.300]   There is a discourse.
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:40.460]   That's why I'm confused.
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:43.500]   That's our different forums at Twit.community.
[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.940]   Those are there for people who listen after the fact.
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:46.940]   They're not listening.
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:49.580]   Actually, anybody can use them, but I think it's mostly so.
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:54.140]   If you're listening in your own time, you can still comment in your own time at Twit.community
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:56.700]   or on twit.socialarmast.net/instance.
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:19:00.660]   On-demand versions of the show are at the website twit.tv/twig.
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:03.340]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to this week in Google.
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:05.100]   You can watch the videos there.
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:12.500]   Of course, the easiest way to do it is to sub-subscriaba in your very favorite podcast
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:13.980]   application.
[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:18.260]   If you would like while you're there, leave us a five-star review.
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:19.260]   We'd appreciate that.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.260]   Spread the word.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:22.500]   Spread the good news about this week in Google.
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.500]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.500]   Thanks for watching.

[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:27.500]   Bye-bye.
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:29.900]   Android is constantly evolving.
[02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:34.900]   If you're part of the Android faithful, then you'll be just as excited about it as I am.
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:39.420]   I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android, along with my co-hosts, Florence Ion, and Ron
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:44.980]   Richards, where every week we cover the news, we cover the hardware, and we cover the apps
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:47.260]   that are driving the Android ecosystem.
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.940]   Plus, we invite people who are writing about Android, talking about Android, and making
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:54.140]   Android onto the show.
[02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:57.260]   Every Tuesday at Twit.tv, look for All About Android.
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:04.260]   [MUSIC]
[02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:06.840]   (upbeat music)
