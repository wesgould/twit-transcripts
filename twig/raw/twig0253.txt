[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff and Gina are here. We're gonna talk about all sorts of stuff.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.040]   David Carp of Tumblr interviewing the president and not wearing a tie.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.940]   The new Google acquisition, they're gonna have satellites, just half a billion dollars. It costs nothing.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.840]   And why they may be buying Songza.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.040]   Hint. It's to stick it to Apple. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.480]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   From people you trust.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   This is Twig.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.480]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   This is Twig. This week in Google. Episode 253, recorded June 11th, 2014.

[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   The show that covers Google, the Google versus the cloud, the Twitter, the Facebook and all that jazz.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   Gina Trapani is here from ThinkUp.com. Hi Gina.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   Hello. Good to be here.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.480]   Now with layered hair.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   You look like an Indian princess now.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   Oh, thank you. I gotta get ready, Brio. It's close.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   I can't look like a work at Homer.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   No, no. Gotta get some pants.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   Somebody goes outside.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.480]   Also, Jeff Jarvis, he is here too. He's a professor of journalism city, University of New York, the author of What Would Google Do in Private Barts.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   And a blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   And I'm still pink. Each week. Yeah. Well, you're home.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   Gina's glamorous. I'm pink. You're pink.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   Jeff and I are the gray hairs. We have to have a young attractive woman. Oh, he's green now.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   Oh, getting, getting Avatar like that.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Yeah. Somebody just sent me a link for an Android beer dispenser. I don't know.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   I don't know how useful that will be. Oh, Android's smart home.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   Yeah. Running running. It looks like a galaxy note maybe in there. And look at that.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.480]   Nice. I actually believe that's rather old. I think that's a moto zoom in there.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   Oh, it is a zoom.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   I actually think I've seen Motorola. Yeah.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   You've exhumed the zoom.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   Well, that's a good, the only good use for Motorola zoom. Exhumed.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   Dispensing beer.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   I loved your entertainment weekly proposal. I'm sorry. I know this is totally off topic.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   But Jeff published his original proposal for entertainment weekly and I absolutely loved it.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   And Neil Dash tweeted it and said how...
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   He did. He was very nice.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   And finally it was. There's a woman named Anne Helen Peterson who published on The All.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   This unbelievably long. I can't imagine animals would care, but a lot of people do.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   Peace on the tortured synergy ridden life of entertainment weekly.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   And I read readings like that. I'm going to get smashed again, but I didn't.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480]   It was very well thought through really well research.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   You cursed out.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   I would say it was going to be a chapter of regissitation.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   So she actually, you know, like probably had fun.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   She wrote a dissertation on entertainment weekly history.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.480]   Well, on gossip. She wrote a PhD in gossip.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Oh, what a great subject. Yeah.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   And so she had a chapter evidently on E.W. and she published it.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   Whether it was part of the dissertation or not, I don't know, but I read it with fascination.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   And it inspired me to put up to scan and put up my original proposal for E.W.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   And at the end of the scan is the rejection that it received.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   A magazine proposal, the ultimate entertainment guide, Jeff Jarvis, January 31st, 1984.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   I'm proposing an entertainment guide, a magazine that would come to the aid of the consumer
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.480]   in a very confusing time.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   As, as, and Neil dashed pointed out, this was about the same time Michael Jackson's haircut on fire in the Pepsi commercial.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   Today there's, that's one of the confusion sources.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   Today there's simply too much to choose from movies, network TV, cable TV.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   It's called video, video cassettes offering cassette tapes and VCRs.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   They were so good.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   It's 1984. Remember music on radio and records on cassettes.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   And now he says on compact discs.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   I remember that's about when I bought my first CD actually, right?
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   They didn't have laser discs in there.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   And let's not forget books.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   You always try to imagine you sitting at a typewriter, Jeff.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   I was like, wow, like he typed this on a typewriter or something.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   Or something like that.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   That was typed probably on my Osborne one and my gigantic $3,300 neck printer.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   Yeah, but it is a typeface.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   It looks like it was an impact printer.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   The magazine would review and give you stories about all this entertainment concentrating on the programs rather than the people.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   Ah, see, now he says, as opposed to the magazine I work for now, did you work for people?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.480]   I work for people.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   I have it up here, Chad.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   I don't know what you're looking at.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   It would also devote some, but far fewer pages to hardware educating, advising readers and so on.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   What to look for in a VCR?
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   VCR.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   How would it should have added and how to get rid of the damn fling, flashy 12?
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   What's new in TV sets?
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   Yeah, that age is big.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   It'd be easy and cheap to start up, not too expensive, prone to solid growth.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Why the time is right.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   This is very cool.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   You know, I wish I had some of the early treatments I did for things like the site.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   I would love to have those.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   If you go down to the last two pages of that PDF, are the rejection it received?
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   By who is BMG?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   Head rate Grown Walt, the then editor in chief timing.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   He said, "Thanks for sending me the driver's memo random about the entertainment magazine.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.480]   I'm afraid I'm not high on this.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   On the surface, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   But the rationale falls apart when you really look at it.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   The market for entertainment is so broad, I think it is different."
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   He was wrong, by the way, but okay.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   I think it's difficult if not impossible to create a single magazine or guide for it.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   For instance, the people who watch television are not necessarily the people who read books.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   That's the killer sentence.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   That was the killer sentence.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   The people who watch TV don't read books.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   Even if one were to strictly to home entertainment, i.e. the tube, there would be lots of problems.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   We only know too well how difficult it is to provide cable listings.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   cassette reviews hardly needed weekly.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   Perhaps not even monthly.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   [laughter]
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   I suspect people are satisfied with the handouts they get in video shops and the occasion.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.480]   [laughter]
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   And the occasional reviews and other publications.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   Still, there could be something for the cassette market, but it might be more like a catalog of the magazine.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   Who is this nitwit?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   He was actually the brilliant, frightening, Austrian editor and chief of timing.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   Oh, so I'm really doing this.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   You can do that in a German accent.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   Movie reviews?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   Reviews?
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.480]   Plenty of those everywhere.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   Besides, this is a very minor issue.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.480]   I doubt there really is a broad market for Jarvis' vision of opinionated and provocative reviews.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   I suspect that.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   The majority of moviegoers don't pay any attention to reviews.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   Oh man, did he get that wrong.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   Wow.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   This is pre-running tomatoes.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   It was like the first thing I looked at.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   Me too.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   It's like if it's not an 80-year-old buttery on random tomatoes, I go see it.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   News and gossip does plenty of that.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   No one needs news and gossip.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   Equipment?
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   Well, that's quite a different matter.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.480]   And unless you are an absolute electronic nut, you don't need to keep up with this regularly.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   Well, forget your company, fella.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   Who needs?
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   There will never be more.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   You will buy one VCR on TV in your whole life.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480]   Exactly.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   He shows about all of this.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   Of course, I could be wrong, but with so many other things going on, I would not.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   And did that kill it?
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   I'd killed it for the rest of his regime.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   And then a new editor took charge and he wanted to make his mark by starting a magazine.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   And a guy on the business side thought he had had this idea on his own.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   And then someone said, "No, no, no.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   Jarvis wrote this memo a few years ago."
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   I have it here somewhere.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   It's in my files.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   And so it started six years after I proposed it.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   Wow.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   Like, you just took people's data in 1984, they typed out letters, and then 18 months later,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.480]   they replied to one another by typing out a letter.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   You were too young to remember this, Gina, but yes.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   Past forces.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   I was nine years old and 80-plus.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   And then a human being would come, would get the letter, would bring it to a facility,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   where it would be routed by a carrier pigeon.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   And then another human being would pick it up and deliver it to your door, ringing the doorbell.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   Same-o in the same-o.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   Same.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   I should have brought this home.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   I have it at the office.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   So we made a bunch of covers.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.480]   There's one prototype cover on my blog I put up of the Wonder Years.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   It's a wonder of...
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   That's a great...
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   Yeah, that's a great cover.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   And we had to make other materials, some fake inside spreads and other things.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.480]   That was made so we could make junk mail.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   And in a junk mail, we sent this out.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   This is now what legal to do.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   It's called dry testing.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   In the junk mail, we would send out and say, "We have this new magazine called Entertainment Weekly.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   Would you like to buy it?
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   Here's the deal.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   First four issues, free, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   And then we'd see how many people would come and send in the cards to order the magazine.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.480]   Before you even had a magazine.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   And then we would tell them, "Oh, we don't have a magazine.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   Here's people instead."
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480]   Which is all illegal now.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   I like it.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   It's like mid-life of a product.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   But the paper is awesome.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:05.480]   So somewhere I've got, there's a picture of like a coffee table with issues of fake editing
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   of him weekly spread out and a guy with a bowl of popcorn and a remote control and some
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   videotapes all in the junk mail.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   So we had to make that.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   I made one cover with Roseanne Barr and Murphy Brown.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   And the cover building was Kiss Cosby, Cosby Goodbye.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   Wow.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   So you were trying to be provocative?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   Exactly.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   You know, the sassy woman kind of thing, right?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   Right.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   And so Cosby hated me because I have faxed hate mail from Cosby.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   And I actually adore Bill Cosby and loved the show.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   But toward the end of the show, it got to be pretty ridiculous.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   I dare to say so.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   So he had it out to me.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.880]   So he got a copy of the junk mail and had somebody, this is before Photoshop, had somebody remake
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.480]   it so it said Kiss Jarvis could buy a magazine.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   Wow.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   Wow.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   Sensitive much?
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   He really didn't like you.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Wow.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   This is fun.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   It's a little Cosby.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.280]   I read Entertainment Weekly.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.480]   I loved Entertainment Weekly.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   Actually.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   But it was a little bit too, it probably was too smart.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.120]   Oh, well, this long, long, long piece by Ann Helen Peterson argued that the first critics
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.280]   were there to be too snarky.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.400]   I don't know that was the case, but we definitely got in trouble.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.680]   This is the time when Time Inc was going to merge at first with Paramount and then with
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.000]   Warner to become Time Warner.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.360]   And so the way I suffered this energy beast was that we were being too mean to Hollywood,
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   which was their new industry.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.160]   And they weren't so stupid as to say you're being mean to Warner Brothers, but they did
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   right.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   Holly.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.400]   One of the top editors, my conceit that I brought to the magazine was to have grades
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   for reviews.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.880]   That's what we did at people.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.320]   So I did at People.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.960]   And so I did that at EW.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.600]   And one of the top, top, top editors of Time Inc sat down and calculated the grade point
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.120]   average of our grades every week to say that we're being too mean.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   And the big ones.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.400]   Or maybe they're making too much junk.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   Everything that?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   My point.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   So the movie critic at the time, Owen Gleiberman gave a bad review to Pretty Woman and this
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.280]   sent them into a fit of hyperplexing because clearly he was wrong because the box office
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.520]   said people like it.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   Huge.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   So you're wrong.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   You're wrong.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.520]   That's why we have rotten tomatoes.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.520]   Yep.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   Exactly.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.280]   And now you can separate the critics from the people.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.240]   So thank you for that little little jaw down the fight.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   I love it.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   Yeah, really fun.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   Cool.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.840]   I've got a box of files like that downstairs.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Good.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   Start one by every week.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   Release another.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   Yeah, I should.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   I should.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   Original.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.760]   There was another one, one more, one more.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.240]   So the first design in the magazine was a clutter and was a mess.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.360]   And I had a defendant at the time, but the truth was it was a mess.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.600]   We did a very fast redesign within 15 weeks.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.920]   But I remember that one of the top editors of Time Inc. at the time said, you're using
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   this postmodern font.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.960]   It was Caslon, which was like the third font ever created.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.520]   There's this huge sculpture in the lobby of Time Inc.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.560]   This building of Caslon that was there.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   Medieval typographer.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.760]   A little geek moment.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   Postmodern.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.760]   You postmodern.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.240]   How funny.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.000]   Well, is Entertainment Weekly still published?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It is.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   You can still get it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.280]   It almost once.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.520]   But it lives on right now.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   So God bless it.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   It's nice to have the baby there.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.040]   I mean, if I proposed that magazine today, it wouldn't be a magazine at all.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   Right.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   For people, right.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   It would be a tomatoes.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.560]   It'll be it'll be an MZ or something.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   Well, that.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.360]   Geez, Leo.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   Ew.com.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.260]   For a while, I was really into the iPad app.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.560]   The Ew must list.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.560]   It's basically just like top 10.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.720]   Top 10 books you should read, top 10 shows, top 10 movies.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.960]   That's what I liked about Ew.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.760]   You could see what you should read.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   I liked that.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.800]   My favorite feature is Joan Feeney, who was my number two throughout the launch.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   It was just a brilliant, brilliant editor.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.680]   She had a feature called the Book Browser, where it was just the first paragraph of eight
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.320]   new books out each week.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.200]   That was it.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   I liked that.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   Now you can get kindle.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.720]   You can get the first chapter and you're dead.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.480]   So for the issues, the magazine also had part.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   Sorry, I'll stop now.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   No, no, it's not.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   You got me going.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   Okay.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   We don't hold up.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   No, no, it's not.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:37.960]   You tear out hard card, where she was perforated bookmark size so you could mark the shows that
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.600]   you wanted to watch and you could cut them out and paste them onto your videotapes because
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.000]   no one ever labeled their videotapes.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.120]   Wow.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.280]   Wow.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.840]   I was a head on technology, guys, boy.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.720]   I was right there at the cutting edge, the perforated edge of technology.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.680]   I'm not cutting actually more like abrading.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   The abrading edge.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.240]   So you were saying, Leo, Google?
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   Google?
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   About Google.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   Sorry.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.080]   I'm sorry for the detour there.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   This is the pre-Kim Kardashian era of celebrity.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.200]   It's changed a lot.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.480]   It really has changed a lot.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.600]   Well, I keep you going here.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.360]   I was actually there at the cusp of when it changed.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.520]   I remember Pat Ryan, my beloved mentor, editor of People Magazine, who died recently.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.600]   She screamed down the hall one day when the cover sales results came in and she said,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.200]   "TV is dead, Jarvis."
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.840]   And it's because it used to be at People Magazine.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.640]   Dallas is the top 10 show, put a Dallas cover on its sales.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.840]   Well, I'm done.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.480]   But then fragmentation came in and so we weren't all trapped with the same three shows.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.240]   Gina, you may think it was cute to not watch "Illigans Island."
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   Network TV was dead.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   Oh, you have.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   It was hell.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.800]   Hell.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:00.880]   And so suddenly, that's when people and companies shifted to bodily fluids journalism, to death
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.320]   and scandals and affairs and disease and all that because it was the way this all covers.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.560]   That was where the opportunity for EW really came in was to get back to the products, not
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   the personalities.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.400]   Okay, now I'll shut up.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.200]   TV's dead, Jarvis.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   TV's dead.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.520]   I like that.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.280]   Google owns a satellite now, a half billion dollar purchase.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.920]   What was that?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   I think.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:38.000]   Multiple satellites, half a billion for skybox imaging, which is a micro satellite startup.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.040]   Skybox, do they own their own satellites?
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.400]   I think they put up little satellites.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.080]   They're little baby satellites.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   And they have incredible, they are live HD from satellite.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   Wow.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.840]   Those kind of be very expensive to launch.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.720]   The second link has a video.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.000]   Yeah, here's the video from skybox imaging.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.680]   Not wild at compelling, but what it does is it shows that if you see a plume coming out
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.440]   of a factory, you see the plume coming out and you can measure that plume to measure
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.440]   the output.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.400]   And all kinds of further data that come with richer imagery.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.960]   Well, I think a lot of people look at Google Earth and Google satellite imaging on the
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.880]   Google Maps and think it's live.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   I mean, we don't.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.200]   But I think a lot of people do.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.960]   I told the star before we were watching.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.360]   You know, we were watching the chase, the manhunt for the Boston bomber.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   And Jennifer said, "Well, why can't they just check the Google satellite to see if
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   he's in that boat?"
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   And how far are we from that, really?
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.160]   Well, apparently not so far.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   Not so far.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.960]   Very interesting.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   So, uh...
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.720]   The Germans are going to go nutsy on this.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   But here's the plume.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   Here's the plume.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   You can see the plume coming out of the...
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.000]   In real time, it looks like it's black and white.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.880]   Seems like this would be for a spy.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.120]   This would be a boon.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.840]   Well, I'm imagining the spies have long had this.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.320]   This is commercial ability now.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   Surely the spies have had this.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.960]   We just don't know it.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.720]   Well, now it'll be easier if you're a small-time spy.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.280]   You just use Google Maps.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.840]   You feel like it's somehow Google's whole business as a consumerization of spy gear?
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   Yeah, spy gear.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.080]   You know, that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   It's interesting.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   That is.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   That is.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   Google Maps.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   Coming soon to you, the shoe phone.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   They must...
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.040]   I would love to know more about Skybox.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.640]   How much they've spent to get these up there, how many they have.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.360]   They're not the only one who even apparently doing this.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   There are competitors.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   How proud is it up there?
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:56.200]   Planet Labs makes satellites that are smaller than skyboxes so it could send more up.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.960]   But the imagery isn't as good.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.240]   Earthcast spelled with U-R-T-H.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.280]   A Vancouver competitor offers high resolution video imagery but has no satellites of its
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   own.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.640]   It uses the Russian end of the International Space Station.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   Wow.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   What an answer.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:19.040]   So these are high-def real-time videos.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.160]   Does this have any relation to...
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.400]   There's mention of the cloud.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.720]   Is this also a communications purchase?
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.440]   No, it seems like this is about creating data from images.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.280]   So raw imagery created by satellite cameras can be hard to decode and process for non-experts.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.440]   So Skybox hopes to sell information, not imagery.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.200]   So it seems like what Skybox is going to do is really going to tell you how many people
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.400]   are online at the Shake Shack or how full the Walmart parking lot is or how many shipping
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.680]   containers are in that port, kind of live.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.000]   It sounds like that's what they're trying to do, which is kind of...
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.920]   Just those examples, Gina, if you counted the Walmart parking lot before Christmas, what
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   do you know about the economy?
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   And that's hugely valuable.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.640]   That kind of stuff.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.080]   Wall Street alone would pay billions for that.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.000]   Wall Street has the ability to recognize what a shipping container looks like.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Right.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.640]   And being able to measure the diameter of a plume and figure out what the emissions are,
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.880]   I think that's what Skybox is offering, not just live imagery, which is kind of all has
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.200]   obvious plug-ins to maps and Earth, but figuring out what that represents.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.520]   Me and my friends watched the Shack Cam constantly to see when the line is short is to run to
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   launch.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   Really?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Yeah, totally Shake Shack has a lot of camp.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.640]   We've come a long way from the Cambridge Coffee Pot Cam.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   Your first camp.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.520]   What do you get at Shake Shack, Gina?
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   What's your order?
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.280]   I'm still kind of a noob to New York, like back in New York.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.600]   So I get kind of like the standard Shack Burger fries.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.040]   Some of mine did some calorie counts and figured out that the fries are more calories than
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   the hot dogs.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.000]   They'll get like a hamburger and the hot dog.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.960]   I'm still sort of in the sort of the very standard order.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   It's like the number one.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.040]   It's not even that they don't have a lot of a lot of variety with the burgers.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.960]   So there's quite a line to Shake Shack right now.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   I just want to warn you.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.600]   I'm just checking the Shack Cam.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   There always is.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   There is quite a line.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   There always is.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   Look at that.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.840]   It goes all the way around.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   It's lemm-lemmings, man.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   It's lemm-ing.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   I've never heard of it.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.720]   I've never been there.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   What am I missing?
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   It's just a burger.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.120]   It's a good burger, but it's just a burger.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   It's a good burger.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   It is just a burger.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   It's true.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.520]   But so now if Skybot could tell me how long it is from the time that I arrive at Shake Shack,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.720]   it's like a burger in my mouth.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   That's useful.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   Is there just one in Madison Square Park or are there other Shake Shack?
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   No, no, there's one in there.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.040]   The one in Brooklyn has a much shorter line.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.960]   They apparently also have a custard calendar so you can play in your custards.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   Good custard.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   Come to New York, Rio.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.800]   We'll do Shack unless Jeff just sounds somewhat against it.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.840]   No, I'm not against it at all.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   Why?
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.400]   Biscuit and jam custard.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   So custard is a frozen ice cream.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.440]   I remember that much from my time back east.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.880]   It's a little bit of a cult thing here.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   People are down with the Shack.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   It's a hipster thing.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   It's a hipster thing.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:26.160]   Well, it's no different from California and the Fakak to not that great in an outburger.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.600]   I like it in an outburger, but there's never a line like this for it.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.840]   It's better than in an out though.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.560]   I think it's much less dramatic than in an out.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560]   It's good.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.560]   I don't take that away from you.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.800]   Anyway, I'd be just over.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.440]   Is it all her to worship upon?
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   No.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.680]   I just think it's so funny that, and this is exactly what the skybox is doing is to give
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   you an idea of how mine is.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.840]   Well, I mean, right, that sounds like that's what they're promising.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.440]   And that's right up Google's alley, right?
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   Now, the other thing Google is saying is that they want to use this as internet access
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.520]   as part of their billion dollar plan to wire the world.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.160]   I don't know how they would do that.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.000]   I guess these things already have communications.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Maybe they could reverse engineer it or...
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   But you know, like a...
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.440]   Well, we're always going to put it over.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.160]   You Google something that you want to go pick up at your local target and Google knows
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.120]   the target parking lot is packed, which it always is here in Brooklyn especially, and
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.840]   says, "Hey, why don't we shopping express that to you instead?"
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.560]   I mean, that's a very simple example.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.200]   But I mean, from a consumer standpoint, that's a big deal.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.240]   Well, if Jeff Bezos is going to launch drones, somebody's going to have to do the real-time
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.520]   navigation.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   Maybe this is a...
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.920]   This is Jeff's going to have his...
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.480]   How many of these little things are we going to have in the sky?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   That's the thing between...
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:56.200]   It's a hilarious war between Bezos and Zuckerberg and Paige now, Paige Brin, the effort to put
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.720]   little things in the sky above us is going to...
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   It's just going to...
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.200]   I tried to taunt the editor of the most what-ite newspaper in Germany.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   Is that me dinging?
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   I'm with Visty.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   What am I dinging?
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   I'm trying to turn it off.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   Are you sure it's you?
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   I'm pretty...
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   I'm trying to figure out how to make it.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   I'm chanting it's me.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.680]   I assume that it was you, but that...
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.120]   Oh, you assume?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   Because...
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120]   Oh, Chad.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   It's a Chad war.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.120]   It's mostly a textual...
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.800]   It's because I was looking at my sources and I couldn't figure out what...
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.560]   You can't tell from the meters.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   Definitely me.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   Off.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   It is off.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   Carry on.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   Sorry.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   My bad.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   My bad.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   Yeah, the only thing I could tell was we're coming through a microphone.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.760]   And so I thought it was you or Mike, Leo.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   You assumed it was I who I was doing this.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   So...
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.040]   Is there air traffic control for satellites?
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.840]   It seems like there ought to be at this point.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.720]   Well, you know, you saw the story last week of the satellite that NASA handed over to
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.240]   a bunch of hackers to take over and do new things.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   You remember that story?
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   No, wow.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.040]   It went kind of around the sun and it came back into a...
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:11.880]   I think in a synchronous orbit of Earth and they allowed these hackers to take it over
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.880]   themselves.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.720]   He's not the word.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.400]   Not the right word, but that's how the story put it.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Because yeah, it was going to be like, "Oh, that's not a great one."
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.920]   That's not quite right.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.880]   So technitologist, volunteer technologist.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.520]   So anyway, part of the point made about it was if it's out of control, it's like a giant
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:36.240]   quiesenart in the sky and could start cutting up other satellites and send her bullet ends
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.440]   up flying between satellites and horrible things happen.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   We're going to...
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.520]   I'm surprised we don't see that story all the time.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.280]   There's a lot of crap up there.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Space junk.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   It goes really fast.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.920]   I'm shrieking.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.560]   Oh, apparently I've lost some geek points for not knowing about the hackers satellite.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.560]   Oh.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   Oh, that was...
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.480]   Those geek points come over to me because there are...
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   There is no loss.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.600]   There are no lost points on Earth.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.480]   It's zero sum points you lost.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   I just...
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.400]   You just gained my...
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:21.240]   So if you search for jerk face on Google, Sergey Brin's picture pops up, which I think
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.760]   is kind of interesting.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.160]   This is all thanks to Violet Blue writing on ZDNet.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.480]   Thanks for nothing, jerk face.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.040]   It's a ridiculous column I will say.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.440]   Well, let's talk about it because on the one hand, it does feel a little bit...
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.440]   Well, I knew you would defend it.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.680]   Well, no, because here's where it starts with.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.760]   It starts with him confessing that he shouldn't have been involved personally in Google+ because
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   he's not social.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.600]   He doesn't understand social.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:57.280]   He said at a conference last week that Google+ was a mistake for him.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.960]   He says I'm a weirdo.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   It was probably a mistake for me to be working on anything tangentially related to social
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.440]   to begin with, which I think is hilarious, but also very candid and open.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   Me too.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   I'm anti-social.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.680]   He's just saying, you know, I'm not normal.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   I'm not normal.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   I'm not a bad influence on it.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   I think that's fine.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.200]   She goes off ranting, just using that as an excuse to rant about how she can't stand
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.440]   Google and Google+.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.820]   Okay, but that wasn't the launching pad for that.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.980]   That's my point.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.440]   She says Google+ broke our trust.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.440]   Pfft.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.820]   Now she was a victim of the Nim wars last year or the year before, even though she swears
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.000]   Violet Blue is her real name, which may be...
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.680]   Apparently, many people around here do.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:49.120]   But she does bring up this interesting case of somebody who is undergoing gender reassignment
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.440]   who got outed to her work because I'm not sure what the details were, but she had a pseudonym
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.880]   and a real name and then pseudonym got mixed with a real name in the Google+ grand mixing
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.440]   of things and people started to find out about stuff she didn't want them to know about.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.760]   At the time of Google+, there was a lot of stuff about the names.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.640]   I haven't heard a peep about that until this for well more than a year.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   Well, people got mad about YouTube.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.440]   You're being forced to use a real name on YouTube comments.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.040]   I got over that too.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   They seem to.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   In fact, it's improved YouTube comments.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Bingo.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.600]   But I think there are reasons for anonymity, but I guess you wouldn't want to use Google+
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   then.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   And the real problem is that it's pretty obvious that this benefits Google to have you use
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.360]   a real name because then they can aggregate all the signals from your real name together
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.320]   to make a better picture of you.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.760]   And really, that's the accusation at the end.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:51.120]   She says with Google+, it became clear we were all little more than webs of flesh spun
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.600]   over packages of saleable data.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.200]   So don't use it.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   So don't use it.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   It's hard not.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.760]   There was a response in another column.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   Just don't use it.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.280]   Then don't sit in their self-driving cars.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   Right.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.680]   Well, I think she feels betrayed.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.240]   She felt like Google was a company that we wanted to trust.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   We thought we could trust and that was why I always did.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.400]   But that's where I still, yes, I'm defending them once again.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   But as I forget who was a rote response to her, I'm sorry.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.280]   Also on zeding that, another zeding that columnist who responded.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.280]   Right.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:29.680]   Or just said, listen, like you didn't know this, Apple makes things, Microsoft makes software,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.480]   Google makes it out of time.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.800]   And this is what their business model is.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.480]   There's absolutely no surprise to this.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   This is the deal.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.120]   You get these great free things.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.560]   But yeah, they're going to use your identity and that's the way it works.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.760]   I'm kind of sympathetic though.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.080]   I like Google and I want to like Google and trust them.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.440]   So I'm a little sympathetic.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.520]   I mean, maybe it's a mistake, but we do it all the time.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:55.080]   Apple, people, you know, Apple's a company, but people feel this strong affinity for it.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.400]   Google, I think the same thing where they feel like, well, maybe we can trust them.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.520]   So what you're saying, Jeff, is grow up.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.400]   You shouldn't have trusted them in the first place.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.760]   Well, I'm quoting that guy who said it.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.400]   But I'm agreeing.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.840]   Okay.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.560]   Google is as Google does was his response is Jason Perlow.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.680]   And he says, well, I empathize with Violet over experiences and how the social network
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.840]   has been managed.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.320]   I wish to point out that Google co-founder Sergey Brin admitting to recode, which is
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.680]   made up of the richest and most powerful people in the technology industry, that is
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   a personal involvement.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.080]   Google plus was probably a mistake.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.960]   Is not at all uncharacteristic of the way Google has been conducting itself since well
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   forever.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.520]   I don't want to defend Google, he says, or writes on paraphrasing.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.360]   I work for one of its competitors.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.280]   I don't agree with many of the things they do.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.720]   I do encourage people to look for alternatives to Google.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.000]   But in this situation, the only thing I can offer Violet is paraphrasing the immortal world
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   so far as scump.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.560]   Google is as Google does, if you're going to use Google services, it's part of the deal.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.480]   I've been saying something like that all along.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.720]   You can't be surprised that Facebook aggregates your information.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   You're getting a free service and the payment you give them for your free services, your
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.600]   personal information and your attention.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.280]   And this is the same with Google, right?
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.120]   But I do think we're going to start to see that, and we're already seeing this, this
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:26.840]   very interesting polarization between the Apple Microsoft side and the Google Facebook side,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.680]   where Apple and Microsoft are going to step forward, tour or not and say, what we protect
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.600]   your information, we protect your privacy, use us and you will be safe.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.040]   And Google and Facebook say, we're giving you great, free stuff.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.800]   And as a result of the things we know, we can give you predictive stuff like Google
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.480]   now, which Apple can't do.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.880]   And you'll have the choice.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.400]   It would be great if everybody had a choice and could choose privacy or openness.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.720]   It's not privacy you're choosing.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   It's that that's the, that's the misnomer that I go nuts upon.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.040]   You know, you subscribe to a newspaper and they know your address so they get it to you.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   And they used you to target certain ads to you and ever thus.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   Media is as media is.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.160]   Well, that's where the real betrayal could happen is if I mean, Google's never made any
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.320]   bones about it nor his Facebook.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.680]   So in that sense, you really shouldn't be, you shouldn't protest too much.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.400]   If Google says we're going to use your personal information, that's what they do.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.120]   That's the deal has always been the deal.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.600]   But Apple and Microsoft saying, no, don't be scruggled.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.120]   We'll take care of you.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.720]   And if they then betray, that's a big betrayal.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.880]   Then that is more significant.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.960]   But Google, Google portrays it's a big betrayal.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.880]   I don't think Google has betrayed.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:46.120]   Well, what Violet says betrayal is, is associating screwed up on the names for a while.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.560]   But then they feel she doesn't like the names, but but she's ultimately the problem is that
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.920]   Google sees us as a what is it?
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.400]   A fleshy web around passatable data.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   Right.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.400]   That is what I'll say.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   That's right.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.240]   Welcome to the media business model.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.560]   You could eat the problem I have.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.560]   It's a little simple.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.040]   It's a little bit reductionist though, because you could say the same thing about any advertising
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.600]   supported media like Twit.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.520]   You could say Twit's business model is to deliver attention to advertisers.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.200]   But that's that's that's reductionist.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.160]   Because yes, that's not untrue.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.800]   It is our business model to deliver eyeballs to advertisers.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.280]   That's how we make money.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.240]   But that is not what motivates us.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   What moves us?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   What gets us excited about what we do?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.400]   What gets us up at bed every morning?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   It's the way we can pay for what we really love to do, which is to give you information
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.920]   about technology.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.760]   So it's reductionist, not untrue, but reductionist to say, well, Google's just treating you
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.800]   as a packet of saleable data.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.920]   That's just their business model.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.320]   There is indeed an exchange of value.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   And the exchange of value isn't just like a free stuff.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.360]   The exchange value is also that I get higher relevance.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.600]   I get better stuff because they know who I am.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.520]   Now let's turn violet blue positively apoplectic purple.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.880]   If you go to the third from the bottom within the Google section, Google imagines people
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.280]   as applications.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.480]   This was a from information week.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.200]   It was a patent found from 2012.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:19.040]   But it's actually kind of mind-bendingly fascinating because what it says is that technology, I'll
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.560]   be eager to hear what Gina thinks about this.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.240]   It says the technology is built around the notion of an application.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.200]   If you instead turn that around and to that we add people.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   Oh, I'm in mail now.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   I'll email Leo.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.840]   Oh, I'm in chat now.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.040]   I'll chat with Gina.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.640]   But it's organized around the application.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.040]   If instead you organize around the people.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   So here's my Leo world.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.440]   Hmm, I could send Leo a video.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.960]   I could email him.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   I could chat with him.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   I could do this.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   I could do that.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.160]   If you re or if you flip the organization, the taxonomy of technology and connections and
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.080]   organize it around people instead of applications, what does that world look like?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.040]   To understand what this means, this is a patent application that came from the Chrome team
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   in 2012.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   It was published last week.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.960]   You have to understand a little bit of the history of computer operating systems and
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960]   science.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.200]   I know Gina will remember this.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.360]   For a while we were talking about a document centric way of computing.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:22.720]   So computing the way it evolved and it evolved haphazardly was around applications.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.680]   But a lot of people said, "Well, really an application is just a way of processing data.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.480]   What if we had a document centric way of looking at computing?"
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.680]   And Microsoft tried this, Apple tried this, and it was kind of a flop where you would
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   start with the document.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:44.080]   I think this is just another way of re-contextualizing what's going on here to make it more efficient
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.040]   and say, "Well, really it's not applications.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.120]   It's not data.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.800]   What it really is is people."
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.000]   That makes sense, Gina, right?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.320]   I mean, it does make sense.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:59.120]   If you look at particularly our smartphones, which are communications devices, it's really
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.920]   weird that you go to an application to do a thing.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.800]   It's like saying, "I'm going to go in a room and talk on a phone."
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.520]   It makes sense that a communication device would be people centric.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.080]   I want to communicate with a person.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.440]   I want to communicate with Mom.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.600]   Here are my ways of doing it.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.440]   Phone, email, message, and everything.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.440]   Right, exactly.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.760]   Which hangout starts to do very badly when I start to see the thinking behind hangout.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   But that's the thinking.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   Right.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.480]   I mean, that's the thinking behind Google+, right?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   I mean, Google+ is about people.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   That's what profiles are about.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.120]   This unified thing where it's built your contacts in Gmail.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.560]   I mean, now if I go to a person's profile, I see their website and all the different
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.000]   ways to get to them or whatever.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.080]   I mean, in Facebook, this is what Facebook, I think, attempts to do.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   I think Facebook actually does this pretty well.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.760]   I mean, yes, the news feed is a core component of that Facebook experience.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.240]   But Facebook is about people, I think, in a way that no other app is even kind of including
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   Twitter.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.480]   I think Twitter is still about tweets.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.760]   I think that it makes sense.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.640]   This article is totally stupid.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.840]   Whether the guy is just kind of clueless or doesn't really understand what we're thinking
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.080]   of, the developers thinking or thinking at this level, he's saying, oh, it's like people
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.200]   as corporations.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   People are applications.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.400]   It's some too private-
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.720]   Just an organizational schema.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   It's not.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.320]   It's noun-centric computing.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.880]   The guy probably doesn't come from a background of technology or a developer background and
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.800]   is really maybe willfully maybe just-
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.360]   He's been writing about business technology since 1996.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.160]   Well, he ought to know better because this is just a willful misunderstanding, I guess.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.520]   The patent application says, "Contacts may call upon applications for handling e-mail
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.080]   chat, voice calling text, video file sharing and social network posting."
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.160]   In other words, make that center around the person, not around the application.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.240]   For example, they say, this is in the patent filing.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.160]   A user may select a file from his or her documents, drag the file to an icon representing
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.360]   the contact, the person, and then the user may drop the file onto the icon, which may
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.520]   cause the file to automatically be shared to the contact represented by the icon.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.440]   I think just like document-centric model going back to 10 years-
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   Exactly.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   It's people-
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.760]   We're thinking about how we use computers, and frankly, this makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.400]   But even if it doesn't, it's not some nefarious plot to turn-
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.000]   This is my point back to Viola Blue.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   This is exactly my point.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.560]   Is that for media, for technology, I want a people-centered world rather than application-centered
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560]   world.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.560]   Yes, that makes sense.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.960]   But when Google says something like this, people are going to twist this around and
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.800]   say, "Oh my God, they're stealing your soul.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.360]   They're violating you."
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.320]   No, they're just trying to organize services around you as a person.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.240]   And we need to do more of that.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.320]   But every time we try to do that, every time it's
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:04.440]   perhaps badly expressed by the technology or media company, and then it cues the technopanic
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:10.040]   people, then we're going to end up worse off because we're not people-centered.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.240]   I say media has to become a lot more people-centered.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.440]   We have to know a lot more about people to give them greater relevance.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.200]   Technology companies should know you better so they can serve you better.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.880]   But it's going to trigger these technopanics every time.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:27.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about people-centric technology is that people vary wildly in
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.760]   who they are and what their past was like and what they're comfortable with.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.840]   And I think that Violet's article comes from a place of- I mean, I think that she represents
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:42.400]   a group of people like folks who have gender transition surgery done.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.440]   I mean, that's a small number of people relative to the whole population.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:55.800]   But those are folks who are less comfortable with the possibility that a software bug is
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.720]   going to out them to the world.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.080]   And we've had this conversation before.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   It was.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   Well, right.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   I mean, right.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   Buzz accidentally releases the location of a victim of domestic abuse location to her
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   abuser.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.520]   Like, these are situations that this isn't everybody, right?
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.720]   I don't think that- and Jeff, we've talked about this before.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:23.840]   We shouldn't assume that everybody has something to hide that could change their life.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.200]   But lots of people are really different.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.360]   And I think it's really hard when he designs software, and I know this first hand, you
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   design for the majority, right?
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:39.280]   Especially in Google's world, the majority is very, very privileged, smart, intellectual
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.920]   folks who are very well off and have a certain kind of life and a certain kind of country
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.440]   and whatever and a certain kind of culture.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.240]   And I think it's a tough problem.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.680]   But what I'm saying is it's not just about being public, right?
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.960]   Part of the structure of being people centric, for example, should be, and this is what I
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.440]   said to Google when I went out there to talk to the privacy group, part of it should be
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:09.160]   doing a far, far, far better job of giving each individual control over how they manage
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.400]   what they have and what they get out of it and what the deal is.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.000]   So being people centric doesn't mean it's publicly so.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.200]   It means that there's the opportunity for transactions and the user has the key role
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.480]   in those transactions.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.600]   And in some cases, that also means, by the way, a company may say to you, unless you
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.240]   tell me who you are, I ain't going to get them, right?
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.200]   If you don't use cookies, the New York Times doesn't let you use the site.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.960]   That's some business right of theirs.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.560]   If I don't pay the Wall Street Journal, they don't let me in.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.440]   There are business rules that we can come up with on both sides of that transaction.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.560]   A transaction requires two sides.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.680]   But it also means that the user can say, and this goes to Doc Searle's efforts in what
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.440]   he calls vendor relationship management, the user should be able to manage the vendor
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.040]   and say, here's the condition that I put on.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:03.560]   You knowing me, I want better maps as a result, but I don't want you to ever sell that.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.080]   And if you want my business, you have to give me the option to pay for it instead of giving
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.600]   me ads or whatever.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.120]   User centric doesn't mean user exposed.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   Right.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.560]   And I completely agree with you.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.800]   I mean, giving people the control to say, this is what I'm comfortable giving you in
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.600]   order to do business with you.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.280]   And the vendor saying, this is the bare minimum that you have to give me.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.240]   Having that sort of transparency and control is really important.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.320]   I mean, it also really complicates the user experience.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.560]   And it's like a constant battle to make things really easy.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.120]   I mean, most app makers just want to onboard people really quickly.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.320]   We're sort of having this conversation last night on all about Android.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.120]   We were talking about Android, the Android permissions model and how, you know, when
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.000]   you install an app, you can have this long list of permissions and you're just like,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.240]   ah, five steps, fine.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   I just want the app.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.760]   Just let me do the thing.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.520]   And I think that, you know, explaining those things, you know, it's a big challenge.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   It's a challenge around education and it's a challenge around settings and control and
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.920]   understanding on both sides and empathy on both sides.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.400]   Good.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:08.480]   Sorry, I was just dealing with a troll.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.440]   Yeah, we've been trolled a lot lately.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.240]   I hate trolls.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.640]   Google is in talks.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.040]   So Apple bought Beats for $3 billion.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.640]   I know, I'm never going to let this go.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:27.000]   For which about half a billion was the streaming music service Beats and about two and a half
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.600]   billion were the headphones, which according to some are actually a money losing business.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.360]   Google's in talks to buy another streaming music company, which arguably I think has
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.840]   an interesting, I listen to songs all the time.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.440]   For a mere 15 million dollars.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   And what's interesting is Beats has a quarter million users.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.720]   Songza, which has been around for six years, has five and a half million users.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.520]   Now Songza has no business model at all.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   In fact, I don't know how they've survived all this time.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.480]   It's absolutely free.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.840]   It's kind of like Pandora.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.720]   If they take the money, it's probably because they can't figure out how to monetize.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.280]   There's no ads on it.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.640]   There's no cost to it.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.680]   The way Songza work is it's curated.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.320]   So you say there's a concierge service.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.800]   And you could say, I want music for a Wednesday afternoon and they say, okay, you want cool
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   jazz.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   They give you choices.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Oh, cooking music.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.680]   Yeah, you could say cooking music.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   And then they'll give you more choice.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   And then it narrows down.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   It's actually a great service.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.880]   I love Songza.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.640]   You've never heard of it either of you.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   No.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   I've heard of it.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   I just haven't tried it.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   I use it.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.080]   I use it in the kitchen.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.200]   Are you looking at Songza right now?
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.960]   Because that's the kind of thing they say.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.040]   So here's Songza.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.280]   It's at Songza.com.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.040]   They do have ads on the website.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.320]   So it's Wednesday afternoon.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.920]   Pay music for brand new music, boosting grandgies, working in an office, working no lyrics, going
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   to Bonnaroo.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   Which is it?
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   We wrote this up on Life Hacker a long time ago.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   I remember this now.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   I love this service.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   There's so many music apps.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.800]   Yeah, no, this was a really cool take.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.320]   I listen all the time.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   So I went, I drilled down on no lyrics to classical, essential classical, classical for
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.720]   studying essential waltzes.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.160]   And it just plays.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.040]   I use it on my Sonos all the time.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.600]   It's kind of like Pandora, but it's mood based instead of artist based.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.080]   Right.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:29.920]   But you can do a decade like you can go, I want 1990s party music.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.640]   And then look at all the choices.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.120]   90s dance hits, 90 school dance.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.520]   You want your 90s school dance?
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.120]   All right, let's go to the prom with Gina Trapani.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.760]   Let's hear what she was listening to.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   It was a curse.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   I know everything.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.400]   I got a satellite watching.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.000]   Can you identify this song?
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.640]   Oh, I mean, of course, I have no idea what it is.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.480]   I have no idea what it is either.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:07.760]   Oh, I guess it was.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   I don't know the name and the artist.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   You don't need to.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   That's the point.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.000]   The prom comes rushing back to you.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.280]   This is about making Google's, I'm feeling lucky on all access better.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   Is that?
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.440]   Yeah, I mean, the story comes from the New York Post.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   I don't know how I like it.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   I was going to say the post.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.600]   What is this rag doing in our rundown?
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.080]   What's happening?
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:36.720]   Right next to the story about the strippers arrested for drugging black mailing rich clients,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:42.080]   Adam Levine apologizing to Xs before he got married and the Kardashian producers refused
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.160]   to pay in Hamptons.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:52.280]   The big three stories and this Google is around the source, one source close to conversations
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.360]   says Google is offering $15 million.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.560]   Second source said the figure on the table is much higher.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.200]   Page would have to beat out several suitors.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:08.760]   But I can absolutely see Google buying this because it's becoming clear that the key on
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.560]   music services, at least if you believe Beats, Jimmy Iovine and Spotify and audio, is recommendations,
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.480]   is curation of some kind.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.440]   I also think it's almost cynically, it's almost, they spent three billion.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.560]   Go find the cheapest music servers you could buy.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   Yes.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   Just do it.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.560]   Just do it.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   Go to Walmart.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   By the way, that was the Spice Girls.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   Okay.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   Just so you know.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.560]   The Spice Girls course.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.560]   Of course.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.920]   I mean, doesn't fit, doesn't Google keep $15 million like, like stuffed in the bathrooms at
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   the plaque?
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   Yes.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:45.560]   The quarters under the sofa cushions add up to more than that.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   I actually like it mostly because it would in fact embarrass Apple quite a bit.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.280]   I just, I don't know why.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   And this is it.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   You're going to get some email about that.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.600]   I'm in ragging them about the Beats purchases.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.680]   First I thought, oh, this couldn't even be true.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.880]   Yeah, that was the funniest thing when you finally had to say, oh, I think it was true.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.880]   It was true.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.960]   It makes no sense, but it's true.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.800]   Google is preserving street art.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   We love.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   It's really cool.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.400]   You know, every time I see a Banksy go by, I think it's going to end up getting ruined.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   That was sad.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.960]   Well, didn't the Banksy project was, Banksy was in Brooklyn, New York?
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   Where was he?
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.120]   Africa or San Francisco?
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   He was somewhere.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.920]   He was in the building and they're all gone.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   And same thing with Christo.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.960]   Christo puts up these big installations and then you can't, you can't leave a curtain
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.280]   across the Grand Canyon up for very long.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.000]   So you have to take it down or giant umbrellas in central park.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.040]   So you take them down, but they should be preserved.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:47.960]   Here's photographs of eyes affixed to dwellings in Rio.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960]   You can kind of see them.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   That's neat.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.480]   There's a wonderful, wonderful movie.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   I want to recommend that's related to this, which is Alec Guinness's The Horse's Mouth.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.040]   Love The Horse's Mouth.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.440]   About a guy who, a crazy guy who just who just sees a space and must paint it.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   Yes.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.960]   And it is a magnificent, magnificent movie.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:15.080]   And so this reminded me of that of Google preserving Gully Jimson's art.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   Shepherd's mouth.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   Gary.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   Gully Jimson.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   You know, that was a great novel.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.440]   Was it Joyce Carol Oates who wrote A Horse The Horse's Mouth?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   It's a great novel.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.680]   No, she's not that old.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   No, it was 1944.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   You're right.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   You're right.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   Joyce Carey.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   Joyce Carey, see?
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   That's how your brain works.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   See how my brain works?
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   Wow.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.760]   It was a Joyce somebody just with a C. Anyway, best great novel and even a better, I think,
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   movie.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.000]   If everybody should just go home right now, stop watching TV and go watch every Alec
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.480]   Guinness movie ever made.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.800]   This is the greatest ever.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   Just be happy.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.560]   But The Horse's Mouth is the one.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.480]   EGR about creativity and passion.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.520]   Hey, this seems to me, by the way, the new style for websites.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   I'm seeing a lot of these.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:02.200]   So you go there, it's video, full screen, and there's that down arrow, right?
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.880]   You see this everywhere now.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.680]   It's the Snowfall Avalanche.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.800]   Oh, is it Snowfall that created this?
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   I think that's why.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   No, I didn't create it.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.160]   That's where Snowfall got it from.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.560]   But I think that that's in my world, that's what popularized it.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.880]   And now medium does similar things.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.360]   Yeah, medium has got that big.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.320]   Because we're looking at a web redesign, and that's actually kind of what we're looking
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   at.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.960]   Shouldn't you, when you go to twit.tv, see a big video?
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.120]   No, you should actually, but you know my argument, Leo, I've just said this to you before.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   What?
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.360]   I think you should see the live video of what's on the network right now.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.160]   That should be there.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.520]   And then the down arrow, and you scroll down, you can see other shows, other people, other
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.600]   stuff, but it should just go right there.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.440]   So what's on now?
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   What's on now?
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440]   Yeah, good.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   No, I think.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.200]   The truth is the website, the web's dead, so who cares?
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.000]   I mean, really is.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Don't you think?
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.880]   I was, I was the vox, the new site started out of Vox Media.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   They created, really interesting.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.360]   They created their entire structure, they created their content, they did all that, and
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   now they're building the homepage.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Right.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.720]   Because they're admitting their home pages are dead, but we're going to have one anyway.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.240]   You have to, you have to, you have to have one.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:18.280]   And there will always has to be a Twitter TV, but ultimately it seems to me most of it's
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.720]   the apps that matter, right?
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:29.080]   And the readership of newspaper home, the New York Times report on innovation panicked
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.360]   because their homepage users was going down, but the New York Times still remains, well,
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.160]   south of 50%.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.040]   News sites I know of in America five years ago tended to have only 20% of their audience
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.920]   would ever see the homepage in a day.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.960]   Now it's going down to about 10%.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   Right.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.760]   So all this effort we put into all of our ego, we put into packaging of saying, everybody's
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   coming to our homepage.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   That's what it says us.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   Nobody sees it.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   It kills me.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   It kills me.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.720]   I mean, we literally have spent millions on web pages at Twit.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.920]   And that doesn't matter anyway.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.000]   Well, maybe not millions, hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.360]   By the way, this Vox page sucks, but it doesn't matter, does it?
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   Well, they haven't sort of resigned yet.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   Exactly.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   But that's, they didn't care.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.160]   It looks like they didn't care.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   You're clicking through through Facebook.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   Right.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.160]   Facebook is going to homepage.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.840]   I think Melissa Bell's really matters is what you see when you go see an article, isn't
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   it?
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   Exactly.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.840]   That's the, that's what matters.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.680]   Most read right there at the top.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.600]   Melissa Bell, who was the, I think, managing her there, she also said that she purposely
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:38.280]   avoided a taxonomy in this navigation to see where it went, to see what emerged.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   Really smart.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   I read that article.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:47.240]   I liked our line about how bread crumb trails, you know, would create meetings and meetings
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.600]   and meetings and meetings and the website would just never, you know, go anywhere.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.200]   And people, people don't use it.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   It's really interesting.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   Smart.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.160]   But it's a little depressing for somebody who's trying to keep up because it changes every
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   five minutes.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.120]   And it's only accelerating.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   I can't keep up anymore.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.720]   How do people find Twitch shows, Leo?
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.200]   I feel like your big challenges, you know, you don't have, you don't easily have something
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.920]   that's shareable on Facebook or Twitter because audio is, it doesn't go viral.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.560]   Like that, like that, that article.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   That's right.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:23.040]   So, well, it's an interesting challenge because, you know, podcasting traditionally you'd go
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   to it.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   Nobody does this.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   Right.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.040]   Go to iTunes.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.640]   You'd search for content and you'd subscribe to it and then you'd download it on your iPod.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.440]   It even sounds laughable.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   No.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.640]   So that's ridiculous.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.000]   I think that the audience can mark a couple of things.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.600]   One, the audience should be able to mark the good spots.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.760]   And then that good spot should be shareable directly.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.720]   I mean, you can, you know, technology is obviously there.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:56.400]   You can say, you know, start at time code, in our case, four hours, 23 minutes and 14
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.320]   seconds.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.480]   And, you know, share the next 20 seconds and to make that a highly shareable artifact,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.280]   I think would be a key to maybe.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.560]   I'm not trying to make, I'm not trying to make Twitter.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.120]   That will be for the next five minutes anyway, but I, you know, I think, I'm like, okay,
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.560]   here's what, here's my thinking on this.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   Cause it's been a while.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.320]   I spent like wake up in the middle of night every night thinking about this.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.440]   It's very, it's incredible challenge.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:30.680]   And I know why we succeed and have survived so far is people like the people and they
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.880]   enjoy the content and then they tell other people and they actually actively, our audience
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.760]   actively proselytizes.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.720]   It's the only way.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:45.760]   And a lot of people, what we want to provide is a lot of entry points so that you could
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.560]   say, well, you can go to live.twit.tv or go to twit.tv or you could download the shows.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.120]   But I think ultimately the best thing for us is going to be to have an app on every platform
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.440]   that says twit and the process is it cause the process is going to be, oh, have you heard
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   about twit?
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   No.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.760]   Oh, it's really great place to get tech news and some information and boy, they got Jeff
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   and Gina.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   They're great.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   You love them.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   You should watch Twig.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.520]   Then the next step would be to get the app.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.680]   Put that on there and then now discovery is great because the app has all the shows, lots
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:17.960]   of information we can do featuring and we can help you discover once you get the app.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:24.200]   So the key, and I think that the proselytization process would naturally lead to the app.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.720]   So that's why what we've decided is we've really got to focus on apps, but you still
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.560]   have to have all these other entry points.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   You still have to be on iTunes.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.680]   You still have to have a website.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.040]   But I think the app is really the key.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:41.520]   My dream interface to twit is Google now saying to me, you search for true crypt.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   Here's a new episode of security now where Steve and Leo talked about it at this time
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.000]   and I can start the conversation right where you guys are talking about.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   How do we do that?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.920]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.520]   Without techs or without a transcription.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   We have transcriptions and it still doesn't do it.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.320]   I mean, every show security now show has been transcribed every one of them.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   Right.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   Right.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.320]   Right.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.320]   Right.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   So that doesn't help.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   Yep.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   You're right.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.240]   I agree that the player should have a, and YouTube does this, but it's too hard.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   People don't do it.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.400]   But if you're watching a YouTube video, you can give somebody a link to that point, but
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.640]   nobody's going to do that.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.160]   We've looked at ways to do that in our player on our website where share this moment button
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:26.120]   where you press share this moment and then it will tweet it.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.480]   I don't think that, I think that would help.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:34.080]   We also put out twit bits, which are short clips, highlight clips of each show and hope
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.720]   that people share those, but they don't.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.000]   I mean, the thing is I don't want to make twit in something short.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.240]   The point is the TV online isn't just six second clips.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:47.800]   TV, I make this point, you know, I was speaking to the European broadcasters union and bring
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   up twit at that moment.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.240]   Say, it's either six seconds or it's an hour and a half talking about Google.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240]   Right.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.400]   And remember, we don't, we're doing, we're doing content that's designed not for somebody
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   who wants a quick hit.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.800]   We're doing content design for a think.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   People want to think about it.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   But it's discovery.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   Who care about it?
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.520]   So it's a challenge the geniuses is a discovery.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.400]   But you don't want to have somebody discover a short clip and think that's what they're
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   going to get because it isn't.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.960]   It's much more challenging that.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.400]   So what we, I still believe, and I think this is, this is, this is the eternal verity.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:21.160]   The technology is constantly changing, but the eternal verity is word of mouth proselytization
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.520]   by fans.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.760]   A fan telling somebody else, you've got to try this is really the only thing that works
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:35.080]   for detergent, well, maybe not for detergent, but for Shake Shack, it ain't an ad that makes
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.200]   Shake Shack success.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.480]   Before Shake Shack or for, it's all these lemons pushing each other there.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.480]   It could be the line.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.680]   It could be the people going by Madison Park, seeing the line and saying, Oh, it must be
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.920]   something going on there.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.720]   What's going on there?
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.600]   We're going to take a break.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:01.400]   And when we come back, we'll do the changelog because a web 4248 in our chat room is demanding
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   it.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.320]   He says, please, can we have some news?
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   All right.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.560]   We brought to you today by nine, nine designs, 99 designs is the place to go.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.000]   If you want to get a design and I think so many people think they can do it themselves.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.080]   And I want to tell you, you can't.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:24.620]   If you're a chef cook, but have your menu, have your website, have your Facebook page,
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:29.480]   have your Twitter account designed by somebody who designs as well as you cook.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.040]   Simple concept.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.320]   You are going to get a design you love guaranteed, 307,689 designers are sitting and waiting for
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.240]   you to go to 99 designs.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.840]   The way they've set it up, which is so clever, is you create a design contest.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:48.640]   You say, I need a logo or I need a landing page or I need, I don't know, a car wrap,
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   t-shirts.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:59.520]   We get all of our twit clothing, t-shirts and hoodies designed at 99 designs.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   We've had such great results.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:05.680]   In fact, when we've put up contests, we get usually so many good designs that we'll say,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.760]   last time we picked five of them, we're buying all of them.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:15.040]   So what you do is you create the contest, a design brief on 99 designs.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.600]   You share the info about your brand with the community of designers.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.480]   They decide, yeah, I'd like to try this one.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.080]   Once you launch the logo contest, you're going to wait a few days and you're going to see
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:29.040]   those ideas roll in and then you're going to pay and a logo is 299 bucks.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.080]   You can pay more, but in fact, what they also do is they'll offer a identity package.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.720]   So you get the logo, you can also get a t-shirt, you can get a website, you get it all designed
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.280]   around one thing.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.600]   There's all sorts of ways to do this.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.960]   99 designs is so great.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.360]   First interaction between your brand and a prospective client is your logo, get it done
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.360]   right.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   You should see our t-shirts, our hoodies, we've got such great results.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.360]   Here's what you do.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:57.280]   Go to 99designs.com/twig and you'll get a $99 power pack of services for free.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.320]   Power pack gives you more designer time and attention.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.960]   They'll bold, highlight and feature your design project.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.440]   In their marketplace, you'll get nearly twice as many designs.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.760]   99designs.com/twig.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.320]   Thank you.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.080]   I do have water.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.240]   I'm drinking it, but thank you.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.920]   I had walnuts in my lunch and now I'm having them in my throat.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.720]   99designs.com/twig.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, play the trombone.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.240]   It's time for the changelog.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.720]   The Google changelog.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.880]   Gina Trapani tells us what's new at the Goog.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.760]   Google has released its official app for Google I/O, which is two Wednesdays from now.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   Two Wednesdays from now.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.920]   I'm going to be sitting next to you guys at that table on the studio.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.120]   I'm very, very excited.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.400]   But this app isn't just for people who are actually attending I/O.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.920]   This is useful actually for anyone who's interested in the I/O content.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   It's a free Android app.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.880]   It lets you browse the conference agenda and add sessions to your schedule.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.520]   You get reminder notifications as they start.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.720]   You can watch live streams through the app for the just not just the keynote, but for
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.200]   sessions and you can watch videos of previously recorded sessions.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.960]   Of course, Leo is going to be doing live coverage of the keynote there in the Twitch
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.760]   studio, so you should probably watch the Twitch stream.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.120]   Just in case you want to see what Google's official session schedule is, you should check
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.360]   out the app.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.880]   It is up in the play store now.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   I'm not finding it.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.240]   The play store has this weird thing where the search doesn't catch up, but there are
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   new releases.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   It takes a while.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   It takes a little bit for the search to catch up.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.760]   There's a 9-5 Google article that links directly to the play store page.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   There it is.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.960]   Number eight in the list.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.760]   Well, they'll fix that.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.960]   Actually, they've actually open sourced this app.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.120]   I'm not sure if they have done this, done that this year or if this is an iteration on
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.360]   the open source version of the app.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.440]   Some good news for Chrome OS users.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.040]   This one, this is for you, Jeff.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.360]   Two really good updates.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.560]   First, the Google+ Photos app for Chrome OS now automatically uploads photos from your
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.080]   SD card to a private Google+ folder, even when the app is closed.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.000]   So this is similar to how the instant upload works in the Android and iOS apps for Google
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Plus.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.760]   So if you've got a Chromebook, pop this SD card, download photos into your Chromebook, your
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   photos get automatically backed up.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.680]   I've been able to do that for a couple months on the Pixel.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   Oh, cool.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680]   Very cool.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.880]   This appears to be the Google+ Photo app for Chrome OS.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.400]   So I think it's a Chrome app.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.880]   But so it was happening in the background, even when the app was closed.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   That may be that actually interesting.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   Interesting.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   Interesting.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.880]   So there is no such thing as being closed.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880]   Yes, yes.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880]   Right.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   Right.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880]   Oh, cool.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   All right.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   So maybe this is the new news.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   So they've extended it.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   Yes.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   It works really well.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.960]   I think the jar was complained here.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.240]   With two accounts, I now have to sign in so I can have photos go to my Google+ which is
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.960]   different from my apps account.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   Right.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.240]   I've got to figure out how to just be done with that.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.520]   Yeah, it's a merge of two.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.520]   And it's a private folder by default, right?
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.320]   So it doesn't get shared unless you share.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.520]   So like the way instant upload works.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.520]   Right.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520]   That's true.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520]   That's true.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520]   But I'm going to go to my grave.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520]   I'm going to have two gravestones.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.520]   One is my apps of gravestone and one is my Gmail gravestone.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.960]   Well, the rest of the world tries to separate their identities.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.800]   Jarvis really wants to combine them.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   Yes.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.880]   Let's see what we can do, folks.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:29.640]   Also for Chromebook users, there's a new Google Play movies and TV extension that lets
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:35.040]   you download video purchases or rentals for offline playback.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.320]   Very, very, very cool.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.440]   So you can watch your videos, your movie and TV from Google Play on the plane without
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.680]   Wi-Fi.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   I load up on my Nexus 7 like crazy.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.920]   Now I can also be on here.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.400]   By the way, orphan black folks.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.400]   That was a good.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.960]   It's a BBZ America show.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960]   It's interesting.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   They're in the second season now.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   It's interesting.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.280]   One actor is one woman plays kind of an infinite number of characters.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   They're clones.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.680]   Like Dollhouse, basically?
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   Sort of.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.680]   Babistar.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.200]   I've seen the ads for it in a subway.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   That's good.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   It's really good.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.200]   Two Google Now updates.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.480]   Google Now will now wake you up before your bus or train stop.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.120]   If you use Google Now while you're using public transportation, the app could offer the option
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.640]   to set an alarm to wake you when you arrive at a safe location, like home or work.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   So this is an alarm.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.680]   We'll estimate where when you should exit your train bus or other form of public transportation.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.200]   Google will suggest an alarm and users can tap the clock icon once to set it.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   So Google Now becoming ever more telepathic.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.640]   Google Now also adds a call button to call me reminder cards.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   So if you say to Google Now, remind me to call Home Depot, for example.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.320]   This is the example on Android police.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.840]   The reminder will pop up and not only will it say, hey, remind me again in an hour, if
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.480]   Google recognizes that you said Home Depot and recognizes that this is a store, they
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   can show you they can get a phone number for you.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.040]   There will be a button that you can tap one tap call the nearest Home Depot.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.240]   This doesn't work if you say something that Google doesn't recognize but does work for
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   things that it does.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.320]   I'm not sure if it actually works your contacts.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:25.160]   The only example Android police used was Home Depot was a store.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:31.520]   Google travel search now has I'm feeling lucky and I'm feeling lucky inspiration feature.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:37.200]   So if you go to google.com/flights, you can enter region of the world that you'd like
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.040]   to visit as your destination and flights will show you the most popular destinations for
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040]   that region.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.720]   You can see photos of top attractions and how the price fluctuates by seasonality and if
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.360]   you're feeling adventurous, you can try the I'm feeling lucky button and Google flights
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.960]   of travel search will suggest destinations you might like to visit.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   Wow.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   Where's it going to go?
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   Yeah, where's it going to go?
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   So how do I do that?
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.720]   I go to now.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.160]   Do I ask do I have to search for something or ask for something or if you go to google.com/flights.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:14.000]   So okay, so I'll do that on the phone or no.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.640]   I'm looking for a here on this page and I don't see.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.040]   So it's in the main on the web.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.880]   Destinations for you.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   Learn more.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   Where is the sign up for you?
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Learn more.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:32.240]   So these are places, well, these are all places it's proposing, Tokyo, London.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.640]   These destinations suggested based on information from your Google account, including your recent
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.880]   activity and web history.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.320]   It wants me to go to Edmonton.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.960]   I don't know why.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.240]   Oh, if you click on the map, the expand map button, there's an unfeeling.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   Oh, there it is.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240]   Okay.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.240]   Let's click it.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240]   Let's see.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   It says I should go to Seattle.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   No, says I should go to Miami.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   Oh, what?
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   Seattle.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.880]   Maybe because I just did Windows weekly.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   Huh.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.960]   Oh, maybe Miami's $377.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   Not bad.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.800]   Oh, you know what?
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.240]   It's also showing how cheap it is to go to Seattle right now.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.160]   It's like this is the best time of the year to go to Seattle.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   I just keep hitting it.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.560]   It's kind of kind of fun to do that.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.200]   Oh, you get other stuff?
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   Let's see.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   Where else?
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   Las Vegas.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   Also a good time to go to Vegas.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   Copenhagen.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   Let's go to London.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   London.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   London.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   London.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.640]   It also shows you a price time chart.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm hovering over.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.360]   So you could see first I'm going to Hawaii.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.640]   This is a good time to go to Hawaii.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.960]   Manhattan, Kansas.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   No Google.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960]   What?
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   What?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.760]   It's telling you to go to Manhattan, Kansas?
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.320]   It knows that I have Kansas relatives, maybe.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320]   I don't know.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   I'm just, I'm just.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.800]   Oh, Beijing.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   Let's go.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   $1,647.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.920]   Now, is that round trip or one way?
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.680]   That'd be a bummer if it's, oh, no, it's round trip.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   Good deal.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.240]   This is pretty cool.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.400]   This is really kind of fun.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   I want to go to Tokyo.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   I want that.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.720]   So if I click it, do I get that flight?
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   Show us.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.720]   There's only so many.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   I just cycled back.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.840]   So it's giving me like eight places and then it's like.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.200]   So 1467 round trip.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.320]   But I have to leave on Thursday and return on Monday.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.640]   That's a little tough.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   Wow.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   That's on.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   Oh, honey.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   Google told me to go there.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   That's a one stop.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.920]   So I got to have Kansas too.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.720]   What's up with that?
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.720]   Okay.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.040]   Now we know there's something going on.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   Mm.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.720]   What is the airport for Manhattan, Kansas?
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   Is it confused about Manhattan?
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.320]   It feels that way, right?
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   Mhk.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   Mhk.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.320]   Mhk.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.520]   Is there a nonstop or do you have to go through Edmonton?
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.160]   One stop through, um, I love the image that they chose.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   Here's a lumberjack.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.200]   That's Paul Bunyan, my friend, who not mock him.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.160]   Look for Babe the Blue Ox right next.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.800]   Huh.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   It is a one stop.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   Well, they should.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   Well, you can choose.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   You got us Fort Worth.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.280]   So we have to go to Dallas and then we go from Dallas to Manhattan, Kansas.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   But it should give you more information.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.960]   Like, why would you go to Manhattan, Kansas?
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   Right.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   You can go to the Blue Ox.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   Why else?
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.680]   Because it's a good deal right now.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   You got Manhattan too.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   That's so strange.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   So Jack got it.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   Well, I searched for it.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.520]   Oh, you searched for it.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.040]   Anyway, that's kind of the New York.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   So it must be just a good, good deal right now.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040]   Fun with data.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.520]   It's because we should see the fly over Gina.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.880]   We should, we should stop thinking that it's just too close.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.760]   Like your life is telling us to go and meet the people fly over stairs.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   It's true.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.960]   All right.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.600]   So this is a bit of change law.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.720]   Google public alerts now include tweets to help answer important questions.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:01.080]   So if you go to google.org/publicalerts, you will see tweets from disaster struck locations.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.320]   So this is when bad stuff happens.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.760]   Basically, Google's kind of sucked it up a little bit after they're back and forth
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.000]   with Twitter a couple of years ago and decided that this product is better with tweets.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.320]   These are extracted from Twitter's public API and they're used to supplement updates.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.880]   And these are tweets from organizations like the National Weather Service.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   And the idea is to have the public tweets help answer the questions like our schools
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.640]   closing, our neighbors evacuating.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.320]   What are people seeing on the front lines of the storm?
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.240]   And Google, Google Public Alerts disseminates emergency messages through services such as
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.520]   Google Maps and Google Now as well as on the public alerts website, which I forgot about
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.400]   and had to remind myself is google.org/publicalerts.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.000]   It's one of these things you don't look at right until the storm is coming.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.280]   And but this tweet, this tweets feature is English only.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.720]   So a lot of fire weather warnings in our neck of the woods.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   This is cool.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:57.360]   You could say what locations, what kinds, what language and sort by relevance.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   Yeah, if you click on one of these warnings on the left side, there should be theoretically
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.440]   there will be tweets someplace on that page about the topic.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   Huh.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   Huh.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440]   Maybe not.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   It's not just tweets.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440]   I mean, like, just might not just be tweets.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   It's not just tweets.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.880]   It's coming from NOAA and other sources.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.800]   Yeah, this is from National Weather Service.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.200]   Yeah, the tweets are supplements to Google's regular announcements and other sort of aggregation
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   from other sources.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.400]   Like this.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.920]   The original text for this alert has been automatically reformatted to correct capitalization.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920]   See what happens with these?
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.240]   Well, if you look at them, these are they come in and all caps.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   They're very ugly.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.560]   And so Google is parsing it to make it sentence and make it look like prose.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.960]   That actually is great.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.080]   I've always hated these weather alerts.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.480]   They're like, they're shouting at you.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   It's much more readable.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   Put it in Helvetica.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   Instead of courier.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   That's really cool.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   We are no longer shouting.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   Windy and very dry through Friday.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.400]   Low pressure over the Pacific Northwest.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.480]   Weather for the heart of hearing.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   Garrett Morris.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480]   All right.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.480]   That's a change log.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:19.480]   Oh, good.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.480]   Chad Hurley and who's the other guy?
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.120]   Jen, Jeff Chen have split.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.600]   The founders of YouTube are going their own separate ways.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.480]   Chad has spun out mixed bit.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.080]   That was the thing they were doing together.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.600]   And Jeff Chen is going.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.800]   Steve Chen is going to Google Ventures.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.720]   I remember Amber MacArthur discovering YouTube before it was a Google thing.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.720]   We interviewed them.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.240]   We said, what are you going to do when you get sued by every company in the world?
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.840]   And they were very bullish.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.640]   And then we called Jeff Chen the day that Google offered him 3.7 billion.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   1.6 billion.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   1.6.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   Is that all it was?
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   That's all.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   And they got ripped.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.680]   So you called them and you graduated them?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   Yeah, the new billionaire.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   It was cute.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   He was a very sweet guy.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   I really like Jeff.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.280]   I'm working for Google at Google Ventures.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280]   Steve Chen.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.280]   Steve.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   Jeff Chen, I don't know.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   I'm my good friend Jeff.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   Yes.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.640]   It was a long time ago.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.320]   I am an old man.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   So that's cool.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.320]   I guess.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.080]   I remember they bought didn't they buy.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.320]   Wouldn't they buy delicious and mixed bit.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.640]   They bought delicious and they sold it again.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.280]   And they sold it back and then mixed bit wasn't going so well.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   1.6.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   5 billion.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   That was right.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   Billion.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.640]   Gosh, that seems like it seemed like a lot of the time.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.680]   And now it's nothing compared to what's app.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.680]   Well, it's insane.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.680]   It's a lot of the time.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.440]   Everybody said Google was nuts.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.520]   Yeah, they made their money back.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   What?
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.560]   Million dollars a day and bandwidth fees.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560]   Oh my God.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   Twice as much for Beats.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:08.640]   I love John Oliver's discussion of net neutrality and how he compared the FCC to having a
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.680]   dingo watch your baby.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:19.600]   But apparently he made a mistake because he called for trolls to overwhelm the FCC and
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.360]   they did.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.360]   Very shortly after his rant on Sunday, the FCC's website was brought down by a database
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.280]   denial of service attack.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.040]   And then there's another report that says the FCC says it was intact.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.600]   The company system is just old.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600]   I just put that link up.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.720]   Well, it's old and easy to face, easy to mess up by overwhelming it.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.720]   Oh, interesting.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.240]   Yeah, it's 17 years old, that commenting system.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.840]   Was there even an internet 17 years ago?
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   I know.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.680]   Well, it's the same Mark, Mark had recent just had a string of, of course, as it's
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.760]   all he does now, his string tweets.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:02.880]   But he was reminding us that what's that new tech series, not the one from like in the
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.560]   70s and catch fire.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.560]   Right.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.880]   It reminds us that the VA's system was created when that show was taking place.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.240]   Nobody asserted that the FCC system was hacked, by the way.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.480]   So I don't know that article is not actually denying anything that anybody asserted.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.640]   It was a denial of service attack, which just means a lot of people put comments in the
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   system.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.000]   And of course, 17 years old, it couldn't handle it.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.440]   So I don't know what I don't.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.040]   Well, a pure denial of service attack would be just to ping it for the sake of that.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   They did.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   That's what they did.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040]   And they did a particular thing.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:45.080]   The FCC said we received a surge in the volume of visits to our electronic comment filing
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.040]   system, a byproduct of the high volume was what is known as a dead record lock.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.840]   What happens is you post a comment and you immediately search for it and it locks up.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.960]   And that's not a hack.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.280]   It's a denial of service.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.440]   And I don't know if that second article denying that it was a hack is actually meaningful because
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:11.800]   if nobody asserted it was a hack, the verge is I guess the FCC said no, we weren't hacked,
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.840]   but it was a denial of service attack.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.800]   It's a 17 year old system.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.600]   17 years old.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:26.120]   And I think according to an article on motherboard, insiders, a sustained effort from attackers
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.240]   brought the site down.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.240]   But it is not a hack.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.840]   It's just a this is the motherboard article, which I think is an accurate article.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:39.560]   It was written yesterday and it describes the database denial of service.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.080]   Nobody's denying that.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   So be careful.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.880]   If you ask trolls to troll, they may.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.760]   Trolls be trolls.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760]   Trolls be trolls.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.440]   Actually, I'm sure John Oliver loves you.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   I love that.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440]   Oh, God.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.800]   I'm the next way to influence the FCC, however.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.840]   Well, but he was also just saying people go leave comments there.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.400]   The troll part was a joke.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   Right.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.960]   But it was a sincere effort to say.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   Go tell them what you think.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.320]   Well, the problem is, which we all have the deal, the distributed database denial of service,
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   nobody could leave a comment.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.240]   So it kind of had the wrong impact.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.360]   My favorite movie theater in the world, yours to Chad, the Alamo draft house in beautiful
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   Austin, Texas.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.360]   Jurks.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360]   I love it.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360]   They're not here now.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   They're jerks.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.880]   They're banning Google Glass.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.080]   They're blood eyed jerks.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.320]   You know, it's funny because I was reading this article and I kind of had the first impression
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.080]   that Jeff did is they're just being jerks.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.840]   They're just, they're just trying to jump on the glass bandwagon.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.360]   But looking at a little bit closer, it seems, I mean, they ban cell phones too.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   Right.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.640]   I mean, they just don't want you can wear your glass into the theater.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.000]   You can continue to wear it while the lights are up while you're ordering your tacos and
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.560]   your beer.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.960]   You can, while you're in, but as soon as the lights dim, you have to take off your glass.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.480]   That's not what if they're your glasses jerks.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.760]   Oh, they're my glasses.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.280]   Well, maybe turn them off.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.720]   It seemed like with them to be my glasses.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.320]   They want them turned on.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.000]   They serve tacos while you watch movies.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   It's the best place in the world.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.520]   And that's more disruptive than the phones.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.680]   I don't want to hear crunchy.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.160]   No, no, they're soft tacos.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.160]   They're soft tacos.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.620]   Oh, all right.
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.680]   And they're very good.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.520]   And so when you sit down in the theater, the loudest thing is a romaine lettuce from the
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.400]   producer, the producer salad.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.240]   Your movie theater seat is in front of like a desk.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.240]   There's a long table.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   Table.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.800]   Well, it's narrow, but it's a table in front of you.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.760]   And the waitress comes up to you and you take, say there's a menu and say what you want.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   She delivers your food.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   The movie stars is great.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   It's the greatest thing.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.080]   Oh, those places around us who do that, they come throughout the movie.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   I hate it.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.080]   I won't go because they come throughout the movie.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   And I don't know the whole experience.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.240]   When you sit down, you don't get any ads for any other movies.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.880]   They show you, they program it.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.160]   Yeah, they would love it, Jeff.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.080]   They show you bits and pieces from like, oh, we went to go see the Star Wars movie.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.360]   Not if I'm hearing open mouth chewing next to me and the waitress coming back.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.560]   Can I have another popcorn?
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.200]   I don't want to hear that.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   You don't.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.440]   You never speak your order.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.720]   You always write it down.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.720]   That's right.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720]   You have a little piece of paper.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.640]   But they come walking in the theater.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.760]   Your seat is on a level.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760]   You're overlooking them.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.760]   Right.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.760]   You watch other people.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   It's going to irritate me.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.760]   I love irritate me.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760]   I'm not going to tell you try it.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.760]   I just loved it.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.760]   I thought I was going to tell you try it.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   And they programmed stuff.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.760]   I'm going there with my glass and then I'll get shot.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.760]   It's Texas.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.000]   It's Austin, Texas.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.320]   You remember how they, how they shamed the cell phone user.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.600]   I mean, this is a, they have, there's a segment before that's, we'll take your ass out.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.120]   If you make any noise in our theater.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   Here it is.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.600]   If you talk or text during a movie, we'll kick you off out.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.080]   Sometimes that pisses off an actual talker.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.000]   This is a voicemail.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   Somebody left them.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.200]   I was wondering if you guys actually enjoyed treating your customers like a piece of the
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   sh- because that's all I felt when I went to the Alamo drop top.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200]   Okay.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.680]   You know what?
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.480]   I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to text in your little beard.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.920]   It was a few stars in that place for me to find my seat.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.920]   All right.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.920]   I used my phone as a flashlights.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:29.320]   So excuse me for using my phone and USA, United States of America where you ask for
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.080]   two texts in a theater.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.600]   I was not aware that I couldn't text in your theater.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   All right.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:42.240]   I've texted in all the other theaters in Austin and no one ever gave about what me doing
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.240]   my phone.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240]   Sorry.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   I'm trying to do this live.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   It was not a word.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.240]   It was loud.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.760]   I'm not bothering anybody.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.680]   You guys, obviously, were being...
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.480]   And I'm sure that's what you do.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.640]   You know, to rip people off, you take my money and then you throw me out.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:04.680]   You know, I will never be coming back to your Alamo drop house or whatever.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.400]   I'd rather go to a regular theater where people are actually polite.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.920]   And you know, I'm going to tell everyone about how sh- you are.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.160]   I'm pretty sure you guys are being...
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160]   I'm just going to talk to them.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.160]   I'm just going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   I'm just going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.160]   I'm just going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.160]   I'm just going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.160]   I'm just going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160]   They are going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.160]   I don't know.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:41.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160]   I'm going to tell them how they are.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   I apologize for the belt.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   There's a few that came through.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160]   Honeywell is going to do a nest.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   Only it's not called the nest.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   It's called the lyric.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160]   It actually looks -- I wouldn't mind having it.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   It's kind of beautiful.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.160]   It shows you the weather.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.160]   And it's pretty much a complete rip off of the nest.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:26.160]   You could program it from your phone.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.160]   We've designed lyric to be mobile first and DIY says Honeywell.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.160]   So I wonder, really.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.160]   I mean, it's a voice activated -- oh, wait a minute.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.160]   Honeywell also has a voice activated thermostat.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   They also have that.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   It is so crap.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.160]   Is it?
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160]   We had it for BYB.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.160]   And I had to -- like, installing the nest was a dream.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160]   You take off your old one.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.160]   It's very easy and they make it really easy.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.160]   You plug it in.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.160]   You snap it back in.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   This thing, it doesn't work.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.160]   If it's not plugged into the wall, they give you -- they gave us an extra little adapter
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:04.160]   so that it could stay alive off of the wall.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   And it was just a big pain in the butt.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   And the interface wasn't a capacitive touch screen.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   It was a resistive and it was just a piece of junk.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.160]   Well, they're expensive.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   The nest is expensive.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   This has expensive $279.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.160]   It will be available at Lowe's.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   And somehow they got Steve Wozniak to -- is that Steve Wozniak or some other Wozniak?
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.160]   They're quoting in here.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.160]   Bruce Wozniak?
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.160]   Is it?
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.160]   Is it?
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   [Laughs]
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   Okay.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160]   Anyway.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   I'd mention it.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160]   I don't know.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160]   What happened with TweetDeck?
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.160]   They were -- were they hacked?
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.160]   What happened there?
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.160]   What happened was this -- I had it.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   If you open up TweetDeck, it was showing you this message and it was retweeting this horrible,
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.160]   retweet with a dorky image on it.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   So it turns out -- and then they said, "On your account or no?"
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.160]   Anybody who used TweetDeck.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   So it would Tweet out on your account something else on your behalf.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160]   Yes, on my behalf.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   Retweeting my account.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   Yes.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   It was a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.160]   So JavaScript got executed inside.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.160]   This is in the Chromact.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   So JavaScript got executed inside the Chromact.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   That shouldn't have been, but what it did was basically retweet this thing.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.160]   It was my understanding of it.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   It turns out it was some Australian kid or Austrian, I forget, I was going to go confused,
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.560]   who wanted to get a heart and he realized that if he started the Tweet with a heart, it
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.320]   opened up that vulnerability and he says he didn't -- he notified Twitter immediately,
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.160]   but meanwhile other hackers evidently --
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   Found it.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   You've seen hackwood.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Found it.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   And executed on it.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   And so you couldn't -- you couldn't do anything.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.160]   And they were saying, "Oh, just sign out.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   It'll be okay.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   It's fixed."
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   But you couldn't sign that because you think it was taken over.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:52.160]   So then I killed the app, brought the app back, and then deauthorized it.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.160]   It was that waste of half an hour of complain on Twitter.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   That's life.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.160]   So this was only in the Chrome version of --
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.160]   Yes.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   Okay.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160]   So if you're using the apps, no.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.160]   Well, they're not supporting the desktop app anymore.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   As far as I know, I think --
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.160]   If you go to TweetTech, you can download it.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.160]   I just did.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.160]   Because I wanted to see --
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160]   They're still saying --
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.160]   No, I think it's the desktop app as a second-class citizen.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   I think that they basically said, "We're going to develop -- we're going to be active development."
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   Because I grumbled and switched over the Chrome app just because.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.160]   And then I really liked it, actually.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.160]   So is it safe now?
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.160]   You know, I haven't tried to get into it since this happened.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160]   Jeff, have you gotten back?
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.160]   I'm using it now.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.160]   All right.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.160]   Because I was late to this, and then I tried to log in, and I couldn't at all.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   It just said, "Hey, I assume that they just disabled log in once they were aware of the vulnerability."
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.160]   They took it down for a while.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   I'm trying to find the --
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   Somebody said, "Beef says in the chatroom, I don't know if this is true.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.160]   I was running TweetTech for Windows, and it happened to me."
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.160]   So --
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   Oh.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   Maybe --
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.160]   I just think, correct it.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   I'm back into the Chrome app.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   No problem.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.160]   David Weiner, not to be confused with Dave Weiner, said his tweet was "fix."
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.160]   One, log out of TweetTech.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.160]   Two, never log back in.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160]   Three, take a deep breath.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160]   Four, look out the window.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   Five, find a partner.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160]   Six, procreate.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160]   I love Dave Weiner.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   I love Dave Weiner.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   I love Dave Weiner.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.160]   My wife walked past my desk when I had TweetTech sort of expanded, and I've got, you know, whatever, ten columns.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.160]   And she was just like, "This is what you do."
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Like, it just feels such an overwhelming sort of like --
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   And you have a problem with that?
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   You know, like, how I'm scrolling down at different speeds.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160]   It's a pretty active app.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   I like to stay in touch.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   That's how you do Twitter.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.160]   I don't understand.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.160]   Well, now that I have a three-monitor setup at home, I'm going to have TweetTech fill a whole monitor.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.160]   TweetTech is pretty crazy.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:02.160]   It took me a long time to get to the call -- because the problem is I'd scroll down to column and then the columns would move.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160]   That pissed me off.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.160]   The other thing is, it's supposed to.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   If you just scroll up a little bit on TweetTech, it'll stop the movement, but it doesn't do that.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160]   So I'm reading the column and suddenly, "Whoop!"
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160]   I hate that.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160]   I know it's what it tweets, and I really hate that.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   And that should be so easy to just stop.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:24.160]   I have clicked on the wrong link because the Tweet bumped down and it's time that it took me to click.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.160]   The activity column, particularly online, moves really, really fast.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.160]   It's like everything that your friends favorite it's everything that's happening.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.160]   And it's kind of always kind of flying by.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.160]   It's a love attack, though.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.160]   I bet the win says, "Go ahead."
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   You're flying.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   You're talking to the whole world.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.160]   You're complaining about this?
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:49.160]   I would bet that the Windows and Mac versions are wrappers around, essentially, a web interface, and that's probably why the frost site.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.160]   Yeah, for a while they were Adobe Air.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160]   Oh, that was terrible.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160]   I remember that.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160]   Yeah, it was terrible.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   I'm not sure what they are.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.160]   And I think that they went native, and then I think they just said, "We're going to be working on the Chrome app."
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   This was the product that your friend Bill Gross was about was poised to buy along with Echo Fund.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:13.160]   He was going to buy up all the Twitter clients and create a Twitter competitor, and Twitter swooped in and offered them an obscene amount of money and said,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.160]   "Not even a Twitter competitor or what he's going to create was a Twitter ad network."
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.160]   Just a serving mechanism, Twitter.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.160]   They swooped in.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   That Twitter didn't let it happen.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.160]   Yeah, they swooped in all right.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.160]   What did they pay for it, do you remember?
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.160]   I don't remember.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160]   More than Bill was offering.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160]   Like, more than it was probably worse.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.160]   Well, I don't think it was just a question of that.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   I think it was also that if you -- we won't be nice to you.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.160]   Right.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160]   Right.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:45.160]   Yeah, if you want to continue in life, you must exceed our demands.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:50.160]   Anything else, let me see before we get to our tip and number and tool of the week.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.160]   Obama did a Tumblr Q&A.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.160]   The new AMA is a Tumblr Q&A.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   David Carp gave me a fist bump.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.160]   Look at David chilling with the president.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.160]   He's what?
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.160]   I know.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   I know.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160]   He's amazing.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   He actually looks younger in this than he is.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.160]   Can I get this full screen?
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.160]   No, Yahoo!
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.160]   Apparently doesn't do full screen.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.160]   This is the Yahoo! news story.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   David Carp is -- as the founder -- look at him.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.160]   This is so small.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   Why is it so small?
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.160]   Let me make it a little bit bigger.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   Here we go.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:37.160]   It looks like he's like, "I'm in the model UN and I would like to interview the president."
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   Is he not wearing a tie for the president?
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   Not wearing a tie.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160]   It's not more a tie.
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.160]   Give him a break.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   He put on a jacket.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   He might have combed his hair maybe.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.160]   Oh, man.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.160]   Looks like he might have shaved yesterday.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.160]   You know, just another day.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160]   Whatever.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   I think truthfully, at this point, Obama doesn't have a whole lot of respect built up in the
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.160]   piggy bank.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.160]   In the tech community?
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   Yeah, but anybody.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.160]   I think the NSA is kind of sour.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.160]   Sour that thing.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.160]   I feel like -- I don't even -- is he president still?
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160]   Is he still --
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   He's still waiting for Hillary, man.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.160]   I'm waiting for Hillary.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.160]   So is every other Democratic candidate?
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.160]   Wow.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:34.160]   So on the list, will you get in trouble and get pulled down if you play any of Celine Dion?
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.160]   We won't get stuck with the copyright police, but I think our audience might disappear.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:43.160]   Where is this one?
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   Whoever's right next to it now.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:52.160]   How can Vegas or airport Canadian man lip sync Celine?
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:55.160]   He's alone all night in the Vegas airport.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160]   He makes a video.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.160]   A lip sync video because he's got nothing else to do.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   It's brilliant.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160]   Oh, let's watch.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.160]   Let's watch.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.160]   He put it on Vimeo.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.160]   I don't think I get in trouble playing Vimeo clips.
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.160]   I think that's --
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.160]   No, I'm just joking.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.160]   What do you do when you're stuck at the Las Vegas airport overnight?
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160]   Shoot a music video on your iPhone.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.160]   Apple should pay this guy.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.160]   You should probably skip in half way.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.160]   Yeah, skip in half way so you don't --
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.160]   Takes a while to get started.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.160]   It's a five-minute long song.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:28.160]   Oh, it's an Eric Carmen tune called All By Myself.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   So he used the moving sidewalks to do pan shots.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.160]   How is he doing the zoom?
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.160]   I don't know how he's doing the zoom.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.160]   He's doing the zoom.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.160]   He does look alone there.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:47.160]   Yeah, he's using the Delta counter.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.160]   It is four in the morning.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.160]   There is no one there.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   Oh, my God.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   It's kind of great.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.160]   I'll give it to this guy.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:05.160]   Richard Jingress on Google+ pointed me to it and he said this guy is now his hero.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:09.160]   What do you think the thought process was?
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.160]   He got bumped off voluntarily off two flights.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.160]   It was a six-am flight.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.160]   No time point in order to the hotel.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.160]   He said, how am I getting trouble?
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160]   So he does this.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:25.160]   [ Laughter ]
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.160]   Do you think he had playback like it?
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.160]   He had to.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.160]   Oh, God.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.160]   Oh, my God.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160]   Women.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.160]   Women.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:40.160]   Women.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.160]   That was a good one.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.160]   That was worth it.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.160]   That was kind of great.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   I like that one.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.160]   Here's the other one that might be too.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   Go ahead.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   Go ahead.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.160]   I was going to ask about totally random.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.160]   But the newsroom I saw on your think up that what's going to be on the newsroom is that a confirmed thing?
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.160]   Was I not supposed to bring that up?
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.160]   Did you read the tweet where it said private?
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.160]   Confidential.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   Yeah, that part.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.160]   I don't know.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.160]   Hey, I agree.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.160]   I said okay.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:13.160]   But it did say confidential in the tweet, so I don't know if I'm supposed to mention it.
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.160]   Oh, I'm doing it for you.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   But I'm going to tell you, when I saw the end -- and I don't think this is a spoiler -- but I saw this the end of Silicon Valley.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:25.160]   And not only did Cara Swisher get a massive cameo, so did Mike Arrington.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.160]   I'm a little hurt.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.160]   [ Laughter ]
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.160]   So apparently the same -- and we all we got, by the way, on Silicon Valley was a tab.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.160]   We got a favicon.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.160]   We got a favicon.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:47.160]   But the same people apparently who do that, which is the on-set playback that they do the computers, they apparently -- I can't say any more than this.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:51.160]   They apparently are going to try, not guaranteed, to get us into the newsroom.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.160]   Not me or, you know, nothing like that, but you'll see.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.160]   And they have me in the photo in there.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160]   But I do. So I'm excited.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   I'm excited for you.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.160]   I now love the newsroom.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.160]   You now love the newsroom.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   I was once on Murphy Brown, mentioned on Murphy Brown, the network vice president, because I had smashed an episode, so the network vice president said on Murphy Brown, Jeff Jarvis, he's a bottomless pit of hate.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.160]   Wow.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   A proud moment in my case.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.160]   It is because that means that enough people know who Jeff Jarvis is.
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.160]   Or was.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.160]   Well, I think you stole live.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.160]   Have you passed?
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.160]   That could explain the pink texture.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.160]   It could be good.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.160]   I know that's really good.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   You know, it means your popular culture.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.160]   But it was also just their way to just be here.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.160]   Did you not like Murphy Brown?
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.160]   I loved it, but then like Cosby, it got bad after a while.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160]   I said so.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160]   All shows do.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160]   They go on too long, including this one.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.160]   So that's why we're going to wrap it up.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.160]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.160]   I have lots of detours today.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:04.160]   Well, I do want to just mention, I just want to wrench real quick, because we're coming out to the Bay Area twice in the next month that I'm not going to the Bay Bridge.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.160]   Oh, you want to show that?
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.160]   Well, the Sacramento Bee did a major investigation piece of everything that's wrong with that bridge.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.160]   The new one or the old one?
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   The new one.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   They built it's gorgeous.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.160]   The gorgeous structure.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.160]   They're saying that the new Bay Bridge is, by the way, the Sacramento Bee very with it.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160]   They're designed.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160]   Look at that.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.160]   That is the modern design.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160]   Look at that.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.160]   The next 10 minutes.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.160]   But this looks just like medium.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   Wow.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:41.160]   I can't believe the Caltrans Choice of an inexperienced company left structural day was a very expensive bridge.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.160]   I think it cost billions to many billions to build cost.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160]   Can you find even more?
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.160]   It costs as much as what's app to build this.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.160]   Just one.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.160]   I just want to say I'm not nuts to dislike.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.160]   I want to say actually I'm sorry.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.160]   It only costs six and a half billion to bridge it.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.160]   What it was cost a half of what's app.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.160]   Half of what's app.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.160]   Zuck can fix it.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   Can you believe that that a iPhone app cost more than twice an actual bridge?
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   Admittedly, we didn't have the best builders.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.160]   Huh.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:22.160]   So, well, no, you don't have to go over the Bay Bridge to get here.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   I know.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   I'm not quite sure.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   How are we going to get to Petaluma?
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   The Golden Gate Bridge, which was built 60 years ago, 60 plus years ago, is actually structurally
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.160]   quite sound.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.160]   That's what you say.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:40.160]   Are you so your fears that the bridge will fall?
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.160]   Well, it's favorites.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160]   This go folks.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.160]   Or is your fear that you will go over the edge?
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.160]   Either one.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   It's a cliff effect thing.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160]   It all counts.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   It'll start shaking the car.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   It'll start vibrating.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]   Gina's driving that part.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160]   I think.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.160]   So you're going to be here when?
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160]   Where are you going to be here?
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.160]   For I/O.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.160]   So I/O is, yeah, we're going to come up after the keynote that Wednesday.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.160]   That's in two weeks.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   Is there anybody else coming up with us?
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.160]   Maybe.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160]   Don't know.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   Yeah, we'll gather up whoever we can.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.160]   Just get them all.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160]   Drive them up.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160]   We'll get a big car.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160]   We'll get a stretch limo.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160]   If you want.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.160]   That's how Andy and I go and Renee Richie came up after WWDC.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   We thought there were going to be a lot of them.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160]   It was just the two of them in a stretch.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160]   Well, I can run a car too.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.160]   We're going to send you with a gigantic butterfly net and see how many people you can have.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.160]   We'll get one of them stretch hummers.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   You can just load it up.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   It's like get Kevin Marks.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.160]   Kevin Purdy, Kevin Marks.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   Yeah, just get everybody up there.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.160]   Actually, we're trying to figure out who's going to do our live coverage.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   I'm going to be here anchoring the live coverage as we watch the keynote.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   Everybody we think of is going to be in the keynote.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   So we're going to have to get somebody who's like, I don't know, not famous or something.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.160]   Are you worried about flying, Jeff?
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   You're actually in the air three miles high and yet doesn't bother you.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   Oh, I'm loving.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160]   If I think about it too much it would.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.160]   Okay, don't think about it.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:10.160]   It is Time, Ladies and Gentlemen for Gina's Tip of the Week.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   This is a little bit of a geeky one, but I kind of liked it.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:20.160]   There's a new Chrome Apps and Extensions developer tool that you can install and you can kind
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.160]   of watch what your Apps and Extensions in Chrome do.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.160]   How many times history basically of their behavior when they access your browser cookies,
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.160]   when they search through your open tabs or modify a site.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.160]   That's great.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160]   Kind of neat.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.160]   Not just I'm not saying, you know, this isn't necessarily a paranoia thing.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.160]   This is just kind of like interested in technology.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.160]   How do these things work type of thing?
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.160]   So this is a free, actually it's a Chrome extension itself.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160]   It's the Chrome, what's it called?
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160]   It's got a long name.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   It's the Chrome Apps and Extensions developer tool and it's by Google and it's free to
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.160]   install in Chrome.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.160]   If you want to see the stuff that you installed in effect, Adam Pash, my former co-editor
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.160]   at LiveHacker just released a really cool bike sharing Chrome extension and I installed
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.160]   that and then I got to install this developer tool and got to kind of see, you know, oh,
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.160]   look, he's going to CityBike and grabbing, you know, how many bikes are at the open docks
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.160]   nearby.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.360]   So this developer tool kind of lets you see that and gets you into what your extensions
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.160]   and apps are actually doing.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.160]   So it says, I just installed it, it's been added to the Chrome app launcher.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.160]   Yes.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.160]   So now where is that?
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.160]   So now where is that?
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.160]   It goes into your dock.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160]   Are you on a Mac there?
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160]   No, you're not on a Mac.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.160]   I am on a Mac.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.160]   You are on a Mac.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.160]   It's in your dock now, which I didn't like that.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.160]   Like, look at your dock.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.160]   You find my dock here where I met.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.160]   Where's my dock?
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.160]   There's my dock.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160]   Yes.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160]   Oh, there it is.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160]   That's weird.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160]   That's weird.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.160]   Huh.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.160]   I went directly to options remove because I'm.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   Can you just drag it out of here?
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.160]   Yeah, you can.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.160]   Yeah, you can.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.160]   Yeah, but then I can't close it.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160]   Whoops.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.160]   Now I have it permanently installed.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.160]   I like it.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.160]   In Chrome.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.160]   Did it used to be in the menu bar?
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.160]   I thought it used to be in the menu bar.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.160]   You can put it.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.160]   It's actually on your bookmarks bar and you can show or hide it.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160]   That's where it should be.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160]   That seems reasonable.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   I didn't love the Chrome was sort of showing up my desktop.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160]   So I removed that.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   But apparently I did it the wrong way because.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.160]   Are you still that menu still there?
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.160]   The launcher still open?
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.160]   No, it's gone.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   It's gone.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]   It's gone.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160]   Hangouts is doing that too now.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.160]   When you click Hangouts, it opens a new it's like an app.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.160]   It's like an app.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160]   I don't know if I really approve of this.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.160]   Chrome was becoming feels like it's really over.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160]   It's taking over.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.160]   Taking everything over.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.160]   All right.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160]   The Chrome apps and extension developer tool.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:57.160]   If you can say it, you can use it.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160]   If you can say it, you can download it.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.160]   Jeff Jarvis has some numbers for us.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   Well, Henry Blodgett says that a source of his says that Uber's revenue.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   There's a lot of talk this week about it.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.160]   Uber's latest investment.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160]   Is it really worth $17 billion?
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   Is it really worth $20 billion?
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   Well, they're gross revenue.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   Gross.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.160]   Of which they get 20% is supposedly running a $10 billion.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   Wow.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.160]   So it's a 10 source.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.160]   But the number I wanted to go to was a number of the heart here.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.160]   Zero.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.160]   That's where according to Business Insider, an analyst says Radio Shack stock will be very soon.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   Oh, they're going to be.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.160]   They had really bad results.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.160]   And we don't wear them.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.160]   I got to go to buy my resistors and capacitors.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160]   I don't know.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   Online.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   And that's the problem.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   Oh.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.160]   But what about the battery club?
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.160]   I know.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.160]   I know.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:49.920]   You know, the last time I was in a radio shack, there were no customers, four or five clerks,
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.200]   but they were all on the phone.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.800]   So nobody helped me.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.120]   I know it's really not experience.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.400]   So I really helped myself and walked out the door.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.960]   I slapped a 20 on the counter just so they'd be happy.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960]   Wow, that would be sad.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.560]   I think Radio Shack is kind of the last bastion of electronic stores in many cities of the
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560]   country.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560]   I talked to them.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.160]   We tried to talk them into an ad campaign.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.160]   Oh.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   You would have been perfect.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   Yes.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.720]   Because it is the place where you can get geeky stuff still.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.040]   We could have saved them.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:24.800]   Maybe it's not too late, Radio Shack.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.160]   Call me.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.680]   It may not be too late.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.800]   If your stock price from going to zero, I have an app.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.360]   Somebody told me about this before the show.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.560]   You're going to love this, Gina.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.040]   You know how you can have the new Swift key just came out really neat, free.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.560]   Everybody should get Swift key.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.160]   There's new features where they, I guess they're going to in-app purchases.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.880]   So they have all these themes and I love Swift key.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.960]   It's my keyboard or choice on Android, but sometimes there's times when you need to communicate
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.080]   in a different fashion.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.520]   That's what the Hodor keyboard is for.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.520]   Hodor.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.400]   All it says is Hodor.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400]   Hodor.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.800]   So I was just telling my coworkers about the time I was standing in line at Comic Con,
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.440]   waiting to get into the game of Thrones session and the guy who plays Hodor comes out and shaking
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.440]   hands with the fans.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.500]   Everyone is chanting, "Hodor."
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:22.220]   And he's saying, "Hodor, back."
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.220]   Oh.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:24.220]   It's amazing.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:25.220]   And I love this keyboard.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:29.740]   You're going to love the reviews 4.9 out of 5 stars.
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:35.300]   Aaron Caston said, "Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor."
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:40.340]   Now if, by the way, you are baffled as to what we're talking about, I'm sorry.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.900]   But that's just, look at all the reviews.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:42.900]   They all...
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.900]   Hodor.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.900]   Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor.
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.860]   You should have this in the Apparina next week.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.380]   Go to the game of Thrones week.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.900]   I know I'm regretting not having put this in the Apparina.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.900]   You would have won.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.140]   I like that it's long press for maximum Hodor.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.180]   Look at the reviews, Chad.
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.220]   I've got the reviews up on my screen.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.220]   Look at the reviews.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.220]   They're so good.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.260]   Hodor, Hodor, Hodor, Hodor.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:11.260]   You couldn't write a bad review if you wanted to with the new Hodor keyboard.
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:14.220]   The sad thing is it's 99 cents.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.900]   My favorite thing is that if your password is Hodor, it's the fastest way to get your
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.900]   password in.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.940]   It's true.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:24.180]   All my passwords are Hodor.
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:28.060]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of this wonderful edition of this week
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.060]   in Google.
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:33.180]   I think by now you're getting the idea that you never know what's going to happen next.
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.860]   Neither do we.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:35.940]   That's neither do we.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.180]   That's right.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:41.340]   Even though we rehearse as much as possible, it just, you never know.
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.340]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:45.700]   He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, founder of Entertainment
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   Weekly.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:50.340]   He's also the author of Public Parts of Fine Book and the Gutenberg, the Geek Book and
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.700]   Amazon Kindle Single.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:55.540]   Amazon hasn't delayed deliveries of your Kindle Single hasn't.
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.140]   I doubt it.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.740]   You're in good standing with them.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:00.940]   Good by three readers.
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:01.940]   Yes.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.940]   No.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:03.940]   It's also on.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:04.940]   I bought it.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:05.940]   Audible.
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:06.940]   Audible.
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:07.940]   Yes.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:08.940]   Jeff reads it.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:09.940]   Nice.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:10.940]   Gina Trapani, she writes Think Up.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:15.620]   That's where you're going to see these amazing insights about your social media who follows
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.620]   you.
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:20.180]   Actually, this is, I really like, I really like my Think Up.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:22.500]   Because I learn a lot.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:27.940]   My number one tweet, my re-tweets out number replies by 48 favorites by 14.
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:33.300]   My biggest admirers, my status updates from last week got the best responses between 10
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.100]   AM and 11 AM.
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   So that's what I should tweet from now on, I think.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.900]   Do you think Think Up Leo?
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.420]   I love my Think Up.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.740]   It's getting better all the time.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:49.540]   On this day in 2011, my most popular tweet, I had 13 tweets last week that's seven fewer.
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:51.780]   So I got to get going.
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:55.500]   What is, how many tweets do you have every week, Gina?
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.380]   Let's see what my latest is.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.380]   Your data is infatastic.
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:01.620]   We've actually found a few good bugs thanks to your data.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.620]   So I appreciate that.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.300]   That's like two tweets a day.
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.460]   What do you, how often do you tweet Jeff?
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.460]   Let's see.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.660]   I'm about 18 a week.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:10.660]   Okay.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.660]   I had 18 a week.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.180]   I thought I was a little bit of a slacker, but maybe not.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.660]   Jeff probably tweets like 50 or 60 times.
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:18.380]   But I've got a great one.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:21.300]   Gina's own application made her a humble brag.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:27.180]   Go to Jeff Jarvis.thinkup.com and go to the third box down.
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.020]   So I can read your Think Up.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.020]   Yeah, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   I want to know that.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.020]   I say I can't even read the truth.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:38.220]   So the third box down reading someone with twice as many followers and Jeff retweeted
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.220]   this tweet.
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:43.300]   That somewhat happens to be Gina Trefani.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:48.180]   Now if I retweet that tweet, maybe I can even improve it more.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:49.180]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.180]   I'm sure that you could.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.660]   Let me retweet that tweet.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:53.660]   See what I can do for you.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:56.620]   We actually, you know, think of has the Twitter problem where it's a little hard to explain
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:57.620]   what it does.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.940]   And we launched a new homepage this week.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.500]   Oh, how is that going?
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:05.300]   I think does it just at think just at thinkup.com, which I hope does it better.

[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:24.580]   Very nicely done.
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.780]   On pages are hard.
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.620]   Believe me, I know.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.620]   You know, Lee.

[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.660]   Yes, yes, it does.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:51.260]   Matthew Ingram can thank Jeff Jarvis for twice as many people seeing his tweet.
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:55.220]   See we love Matthew.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.020]   One fat frog followed me selling new and used restaurant equipment in Orlando.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.620]   How do you think I'm telling you that?
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:08.260]   That's like I said, your date is really good at figuring surfacing bugs.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:12.260]   You never know what you're going to find.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:13.700]   Leo Laporta is getting personal.

[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:35.180]   Aang.
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:36.180]   What's my Pixel?
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:37.180]   I love my Pixel.
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:38.180]   Both of them.

[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:46.740]   I'm Pixel up, and I'm Chromebooked up.

[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.820]   Actually, I've completely come around on Chromebooks.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.980]   I recommend them on the radio show all the time to people who just need something.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.460]   They're the perfect thing.
