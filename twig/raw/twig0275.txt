[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff and Gina are here. Kevin Tofel from Giga Home 2. Kevin is bringing his Nexus 6 phone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We'll get a first review from Kevin on that. That's exciting.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   We'll also talk about Lollipop rolling out for a variety of devices today.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And Taylor Swift's pulling out a Spotify. What does that mean for the record industry? It's all coming up next.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   On Twig.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Where we talk about Google, yes, but also a lot of stuff about the cloud and Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Gina Tappani is here, founding editor of Life Hacker.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   She is hacking her own software at ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Mother, daughter, sister.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Sister.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hello.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Good to be here.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I wasn't sure actually.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I knew you were a mother and a daughter. I wasn't sure about the sister part.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yes, three times over.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Three times a sister.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Nice to see you. A little under the weather earlier. I'm sorry, but I hope you're feeling okay.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   A little bit, a little bit. First cold of the winter, I guess.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's one of them. I'm a little stuffed up myself.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Also here from the City University of New York from CUNY.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He just flew in from where?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Prague.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Oh, I love Prague. Did you see any of it?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I walked some hours.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   That's about it. It's an amazing place.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We'll do this.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   European broadcasters union news event.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Oh, neat. That's neat.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, it's only about nine.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I woke up at one thirty Prague time.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I'm going to go get back to sleep.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Morning.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I got a couple hours on the plane.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'm groggy.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I'm groggy.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, groggy.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Groggy.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Well, if you need to bow out, you can, because we weren't sure if you'd make it.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So we brought in a ringer, ladies and gentlemen, from giga-alm their mobile editor, Kevin Toful.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hey there. How are you, Leo?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Great to see you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Let's be honest, though.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You know, Jason said the only reason you want me on this show is because I got one of these nexus points.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Ah!
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Ah!
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh, yes it is. Look at that.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   You enjoy showing that, don't you?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I do. It's nice. It's nice. We'll talk about it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I know.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's so big it takes up the whole frame of your camera.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Actually, I'm pretty small, too, but that's fun.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This has been a banner year for Android devices for phones in general, but particularly for Android devices.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   The ecosystem is clearly mature. The variety and choice available to consumers is unparalleled.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And it's hard to pick one because there's so many good choices.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It started with the HTC One, which is still a gorgeous, beautiful phone.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We had the Galaxy S5, which I wasn't as crazy about, although I love the Note 4.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Ah! Really great phone. Motorola, of course, not to be left out.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Did a number of phones. They updated the G, which is a low-priced phone, but still for many, exactly the right price size and feature set.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Then the Moto X 2014 edition.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Then the Droid Turbo, which frankly is just a Moto X on steroids.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Don't forget the OnePlus One.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   The OnePlus One, which we still think maybe it was the winner, the kind of the dark horse.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We'll see how the Nexus 6 looks.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Embarrassing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And you played with both?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I have. I have.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And the OnePlus One is very nice. It's hard to get, obviously, because the whole invite system and whatnot.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But you're getting a lot of phone for $300.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah, that's the key, right? $300 or $350 for the 64 gig.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And the other thing about it, I found no other phone that had its battery life.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   None.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   20 hours in normal use for me is remarkable.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So, and that was kind of bitching about this last week.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You take the Droid Turbo, you take a phone, you add a massive battery.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And then you say, "Well, what else can we do now that we have all this battery life?"
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   "Well, let's put a 2.7 gigahertz quad-core processor in it and a quad HD screen."
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And then the battery life goes right back down to normal.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You know, would have been like incredible.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So you kind of have a similar situation with the set Nexus 6.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's a QHD screen.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   A lot of pixels to push the battery life.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   What's the battery life there?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I think most people will get through a full day on it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I mean, if you're a heavy-duty power user, I don't think 20 hours is going to fly.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's a 3,220 milliamp hour battery.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Comes with that turbo charger, just like the Droid Turbo.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It recharges the whole phone in less than two hours.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's very, very quick.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But, you know, I think most people are good for a day on this.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Good.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That's the real question.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Because in every other respect, it's a beast.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It is.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The camera is not historically done.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Great cameras.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You know, Google says it's the best Nexus camera yet, which, you know, that's not a high bar
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that they've set there.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But yes, it's actually quite good.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's surprisingly good.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   There's still some bugs with Android 5.0.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Even the camera app itself crashed on at least six times in the last 10 days.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So, you know, there's some things they need to work out.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But the actual quality is pretty good.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Low light is still a challenge, I think.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That's definitely going to be a problem.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   There's still some better camera phones out there.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The Lumia is the iPhone 6, for example.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Just do better in low light, in my opinion.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And, you know, the truth is it's going to be about as hard to get for some time as a 1+1.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Maybe even harder.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   With the 1+1, at least you could win.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I managed Motorola.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Did you?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I twig.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   God bless.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I got two twig fans who came in to Twitter and said, "Order now."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I went in and the first one, it said, you know, the thing you just ordered isn't in the stock anymore.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   In my car.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So, I refreshed the order and killed one of them and it supposedly on its way on November 18th.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Nice.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Which one did you get?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   The Black 64.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   That's, yes, exactly.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I had to settle for, I think, a Black 32 or a Midnight Blue 32.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I wanted the Silver 64.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But, you know what, this is, I think this really rounds out the year.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   What a year it has been for smartphones.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Wow.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Any size, any shape, lots of power.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Any price?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Any price?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's the only negative, I guess, in the Nexus 6.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's 650 bucks starting point.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's really priced like the other high-end phones.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And it always had to look at the course of the mouth because you're right.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It has been a great year for the variety.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But I think it took the phones arrived and then the variety spread out.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And the question is, is there now a next development of amazing things phones will do?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You know, I got to say, I think we're now in a very mature space.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I think we are, yeah.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's hard to imagine, I guess you could make the camera better.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   There's no quad HD, it's already beyond anything anybody cares about.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   The Droid Turbo is more than 500 dots per inch.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Done.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   There's no point in going, in fact, overdone already.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Battery life would be nice.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah, I mean, screens that don't break, totally waterproof front-facing cameras that match
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   back-facing cameras in terms of, you know, I mean, I think there's still some catching up
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   that we can do.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I still think, go ahead, Kevin.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I don't think he's saying anything.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   No, I don't think he's saying.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Don't put words in my mouth.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He's the guy who would always probably be good.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I just think things now.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I still go for a vision that I'm going to have on my person, my computer, and the phone is
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   another accessory device to it.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   What?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   See, I think this is your computer.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And next is a computer.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   No, I think where it goes.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I think that, in essence, this becomes your computer.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Your computer is something that is you and is on you.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Like you wear it.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And this becomes a display unit.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So you're saying the phone is a display unit for the watch?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Well, not the watch.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I mean, I don't care.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You have something on you, your key fob or your something that's your computer, that's
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   your identity, that's your you.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And that it can speak through your phone, your tablet, your laptop, your watch, your
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   glasses, your whatever.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I think that's where we eventually go here, is that you kind of have one computer in
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   many accessories.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I think you need a computer in the fifth dimension that is as big as a house.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   But it has a little viewport on you in your dimensions.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And it can land on comments.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Hey, by the way, wow.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Wow.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Did you all get up in the morning?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It was 11 a.m. for you, 8 a.m. for us.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   But I had to watch it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Even CNN covered it.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So it must be.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I was on the plane.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   What was there to watch?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Seven hours of waiting?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Well, at 8 a.m. it landed, but we didn't get a picture for 30 minutes.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.600]   But just watching the folks at Mission Control and the European Space Agency, when they got
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.000]   the news that it had touched down and seemed to have survived.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Remember, they launched this 10 years ago.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So they've been waiting for today for 10 years, not knowing if it, you know, might miss or
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   crash or all sorts of things.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   There's a thing.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I haven't seen other new good pictures up.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Lots of pictures.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It's sending out pictures.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   There was some issue.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I think that they have several ways of fixing it to the comet.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   One, the harpoons did not deploy, but they have screws on the feet, which did work, which
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   screwed in.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, the thruster was supposed to push it down, didn't deploy.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Right.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   So there's harpoons did out of the harpoons did deploy?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Okay, I might be wrong.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Anyway, it's there.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I think they need to secure it a little bit.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But other than that, there's a picture of the comet.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Yeah, that's going in.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yes, this is during descent about three kilometers from the surface.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   There's the little guy.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   That one I saw.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   This is it.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   That's a rendering, I believe photo illustration, as they say.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   No, that's accurate.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   This is exactly what it looks like.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   You can see the Arctic tree on from there.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That's the comet.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's a pretty big little thing.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Here's an image of the surface.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That was from the fly.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   From the, yeah, because they still have a, so they have a satellite going around and they
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   had deployed the lander from the satellite.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So I'm looking, maybe there'll be some more pictures.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   This is it.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   This is the set.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So this is, but they're going to be, right?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   They haven't come yet.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Uh oh, so they keep losing communication with it.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   They've got a lot of data, no pictures yet.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Oh, the ice screws had been shot by the craft's harpoons and were secured to securing it to
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   the surface.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The lander is in great shape.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It says that the harpoons did not fire.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The agency is looking at trying again.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Oh no, it's you.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You were right.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I was wrong.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   After analyzing telemetry, the ESA says it seems the craft's harpoons didn't fire as first thought.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I'm curious.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I'm curious which carrier they're using.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They're losing signal and they got their new blades there.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   It ain't Verizon.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Today I'll be complaining about AT&T later.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Just really amazing.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You can follow it on Twitter.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Just really cool.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   It's making sounds.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   The sounds are at a frequency higher than the capability if you're in hearing 40 to 50
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   millihertz, but if you make it audible and increase it by a factor of a thousand, this
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   is what it's.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Can you hear my audio?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   This is the comet singing.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Sounds like dolphin.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   It does.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It totally does.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   What if they're trying to signal the dolphins?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   That must be it.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They're in cahoots.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Sounds like a Star Trek movie.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It feels like a little Douglas Adams.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Like we actually unknowingly are doing the work of the dolphins.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   To get this thing there, the dolphins sent us a message 10 years ago.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   We're doing the work of the dolphins.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   By playing this, I am now learning the dolphins.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I knew they were smart.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   We are here.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm afraid to play this any longer.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   No, no, it's good.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I'm afraid about what might happen.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   The work of the dolphins.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   This is good.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   In the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, we're one of the volumes.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   The dolphins leave.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Turns out they were in fact the smartest species on earth.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   They leave a little note saying so long and thanks for all the fish.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I love that line.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's not great.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I can kind of listen to this forever.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I love it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I'm blown away by this.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You've got to do more of this.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Meanwhile, Jeff wants a computer in fifth dimension.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Jeff and I have ordered.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Now you're not Gina.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You're happy with your OnePlus.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   You're going to stick with that.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I'm going to stick with it.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I've been through a few too many phones this year.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   As long as I don't destroy this one, I'm going to hold on to it.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   What is the update situation there?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Because you're running cyanogen.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Yeah, running cyanogen.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I think they said 90 days from the AOSP drop.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I think they said the new mod is supposed to be out now for our OnePlus 1.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Oh, not R39 or something.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Oh, well, no, I think it's a bigger number.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I think it's 45 or something.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But this might fix the problem I have with my phone, but I still don't know.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It's now a week and a half and I have a working phone.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   What's your what?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Wait, what?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   PNT.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I've worked for years with AT&T.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I think it's yours.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Here's the deal as quick as I can make it.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I've got a video up on the rundown.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I'm going to pull that up for you.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Every single time that I call, you'll see this.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It just happened time after time, after time, after time, after time again.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I went with a very nice person on Twitter and a very nice person elsewhere.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Then it got escalated.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I'm trying to call the AT&T retail store.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It will ring.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And they call it just ends.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It drops.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Well, I think you have a defective.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And then people start singing and then people sing.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Paris last year.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   He's lost the signal again.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Oh, he's lost the signal again.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   That Jeff Jarvis has.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   (Laughter)
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   (Inaudible)
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   (Laughter)
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   No, it's not back to phone because I put the SIM in my Nexus 5 and same problem.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So I go round and round and round and say, well, we're doing some upgrades.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Oh, so in your Nexus 5, you drop calls with the same SIM.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I dropped every, almost every call, 99% of the calls.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So I go to the store to get a new SIM finally.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   They tell me that's not going to do any good.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I get a new SIM.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   They tell me to get a SIM.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I get a SIM.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They're doing a good.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I finally go to the device repair center, wherever they call it.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And they say, oh, yeah, no an issue.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Nexus 5, two weeks.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   LTE can't, the only fix we have is to down-code.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What a hell of a fix AT&T.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   That's great.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   So I'm doing all kinds of troubleshooting.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It gets elevated thanks to another Twig fan, a marketing executive.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And I get to the person at corporate and where they were saying, oh, we were up great.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Well, clearly what happened here was that there's been no new software for the Nexus 5 with a 1 plus 1.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So you guys changed something in your system that made it not work.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And then they came back and said, well, no, we haven't changed anything.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And they were telling me they were upgrading the whole time.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   So they were speaking with me.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And so they're speaking with Fork and Tongue.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And so their big responsibility was buy an AT&T phone.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Oh, that's not a good idea.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And yet I know I've used both the 1 plus and the Nexus 5 on AT&T.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   It seems to be regionally here.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   It must be a regional issue.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Now I went to my good buddy, my good Twig fan buddy, Alex Hugo, who works in a store.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   He's just been very nice and helped me time and time again.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And I've praised him to the hilt, to the AT&T executives.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   This is a guy who cares about AT&T working for its customers.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And Alex, thank you for all your help.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And there's the woman at corporate tonight, but his theory was just trying to guess.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There have been issues with voiceover LTE.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I don't even know what to say over LTE.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Yeah, well, that would make sense.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   That's been an issue.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   That would make sense.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So I'm in the one hand, I'm ready to throw up my hands and have psychofed.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So the other hand, I'll wait for my Nexus 6 and my presumably work.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Because if it doesn't, there'll be lots of people.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Let's just go to T-Mobile, which you should have done ages ago.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I probably won't.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   How's T-Mobile in Manhattan?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Is it OK?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I love T-Mobile.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I have my grandfather on limited data plan with AT&T.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Really?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   They haven't taken that away from you yet.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Well, just maybe.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You know they want to.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   How can we get Jarvis off of that unlimited data?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Just turn his 4G off.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's one way to do it.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   That's one way to do it.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   That's one way.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   So just to wrap it up on the Nexus 6, you want to give us a quick pros and cons.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Kevin, you've used it for 10 days.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   This is really the most thorough test I've heard about.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   No, I got a little dog and pony show in New York City with Google about 10 days ago.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Walked home with the Nexus 6.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   You know, it's definitely a big phone right off the bat.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Show us the screen.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Show us the screen a little bit so we can get a sense.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Sure.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Yeah, it looks big.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It's big.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I don't have an iPhone 6.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I think it was rounded without stretching too much.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   No, and that's because it's got the nice rounded back like the other Moto phones and all.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It's about as big as the iPhone 6 plus.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It's filled with the hand, doesn't it?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Oh, it definitely fills the hand.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You know, I mean, you know, next to my head, it's perfect.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Oh, we've gotten over that years ago.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's fine.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I do have a Moto X from this year to compare it to.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That's a good comparison.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Yeah, so I think that's a fair comparison.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Not so much bigger.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I mean, it's bigger.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   This is my OnePlus one and my figures are like all dangly on it, right?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You got room.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I mean, so, so right off the bat, it's big.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And see, that's kind of, I said in my review, the Nexus 6 is in a very strange place because
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   let's think about it.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   This is the first time that all the carriers are selling the Nexus phone.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It's really a very close copy of an existing phone in the Motorola Moto X and the Droid
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and so on.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And it's bigger than any phone pretty much out there right now.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   A few exceptions.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The OnePlus one.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The OnePlus one is only five and a half inches.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So this is the Note 4.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   The Note 4 is bigger physically, but a smaller screen is 5'7.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Correct.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   They really did pack in that.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   It's actually a 5.96 inch display.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I call it 6 here, but it's a beautiful display.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Leo, as you said, it's the quad HD.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I mean, it's just gorgeous.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   You know, you can't see pixels and such.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.080]   But, you know, so part of me says that this is all great, but really internally it's got
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.640]   the same guts as say the Droid Turbo.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.400]   It's got the nice big battery.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   And those are smaller.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   They're a little easier to handle.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.160]   So I think a lot of people, you know, if you need a big phone, okay, this is a great
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.680]   one and it's got Lollipop.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.520]   The other ones are all getting Lollipop like now and they're a little more easier to manage.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.120]   So it's a nice phone.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.000]   It's probably the first Nexus that really hasn't cut any corners.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.320]   It was always something missing, you know, be it a bad display quality or a bad camera
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   or whatever.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.640]   This is really the first no corner cut Nexus device that I can think of and it's nice,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.360]   but it's a handful.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   So that's what I'm kind of saying is I think we're at a maturity point on this stuff.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.080]   The processors are more than fast enough.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.480]   A turbo has a 2.7 gigahertz.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   Same chip.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   Same chip is that.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   805.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.560]   High end GPUs in these things.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.520]   I don't think you need much faster.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.120]   Lollipop is pretty darn mature.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:36.840]   I mean, I think this is a, all the hard edges have been sanded down.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   So what's next?
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.400]   It feels like we should close up shop.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.840]   We've hit Alpha State.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.240]   I think it's possible that this phone you buy, this last few months of the year will
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.120]   be the last phone you buy for a couple of years.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   Wow.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   Like you, of course.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   Not me.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.960]   No, I can't go there.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.440]   But I frankly don't think there'll be much of an improvement going forward.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.200]   I think this is about as good as you're going to get.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Maybe better cameras.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.680]   You know, there's one thought though, and this really surprised me that this is all
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.440]   meant to showcase Android 5.0, which it does.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:14.000]   But Android 5.0 is Google 64-bit operating system and only the Nexus 9 right now has
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.360]   a 64-bit chip.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.400]   I'm not saying people are going to notice a difference between 32-bit, 64-bit and so
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   on.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.280]   But the point about this may be the last phone you buy for a while, I would have liked it
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.520]   if it had the Snapdragon 810, which is not yet available, but is 64-bit, for example.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.960]   Then your future-proofed, you know?
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.280]   Maybe although I'm not sure what you get with 64-bit, access to more than 4GB of RAM,
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.760]   and none of these devices that Nexus 9 only has 2GB of RAM.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.640]   So none of these devices use anything really significant with 64-bits, and they're all
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   plenty fast enough.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:56.880]   I think 64-bits is like Quad HD, a number that's kind of detached from any real value.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.600]   It's just, well, it's got to be better.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.280]   It's twice as many bits.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.200]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.640]   So yeah, I guess- What are your predictions about Project ARR?
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.120]   Oh, that's a joke.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   Come on.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.240]   We had, remember the visor?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   Remember that?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   The visor.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.640]   Yeah, the visor had, okay.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.680]   So this was a palm device that had modules you could slot in.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   Terrible idea.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   The things fall out.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   They're janky.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   They never fits quite as nicely and as beautiful as it would if it were built in.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.060]   People don't, I don't think consumers say, "Yes, it's bad enough that there's 12 phones
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.760]   to go in and say, 'Well, okay, now what modules you want installed is way too much.'
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.760]   People know what they want.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   Yeah, hobbyists.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   Yeah, hobbyists.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   It's a hobbyist thing.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   And I think it always has been.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.160]   I think it'll be a successful hobbyist thing though.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.960]   Yeah, I mean, gas.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   Well, but to Kevin's point, you could conceivably modularize the whole mother board, but the
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.760]   chip and change the chip is not great.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.160]   You change the chip, it'll cost as much as buying a new phone.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.960]   Exactly, that's the problem.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.400]   So you just get a new phone.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   Here's the visor.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.560]   We actually have one here.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.280]   It's better than the picture I was searching for.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   Yeah, no, this is it.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.000]   So you recognize kind of the palm form factor, but instead-
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.760]   Aww, I hate nowhere, remember.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.600]   You could put a modem in there.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   And other stuff.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   Oh, God.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.920]   So that's Project Era.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.840]   Back to the future.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   I know people are so excited about Project Era, and I guess it's the maker movement and
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.360]   the hobbyists and stuff we want to.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   But it's not even going to be that interesting.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.880]   You're going to have eight modules or whatever.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.480]   You can snap them together.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   I don't.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.440]   So that's not what's next.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.040]   I think we've got one then.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.240]   Well, is there anything you feel like you don't have?
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.880]   By the way, PCs hit this maturity point years ago.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   You said it yourself, Jeff.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.600]   I'm not going to buy another PC, you said.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.040]   You don't need to.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.440]   There you go.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.520]   Well, the funny is I have this reflex where I actually, I mean, my Chromebook is absolutely
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   fine.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.800]   That's the best one in the market.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   I still want to get a new one.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.000]   Yeah, because there's this consumer urge.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Right.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Ad.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.400]   You're still using the Pixel, Jeff?
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   You bet.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   I'm the one.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   Yep.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   Are you on it right now?
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Yeah, I am.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.320]   Actually, you know, I think I've come around on Chromebook.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.840]   I really see its value for certain users.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.240]   And I actually recommend it a lot on the radio show for people who just need, if I say,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   you're just browsing an email, yeah, then you know, you need a Chromebook.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.840]   And you don't have to wear a security or anything.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   That's good advice.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:53.040]   If you go to Google right now, I think, I might have turned it off, you will get, you
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.760]   will be encouraged to donate to fight Ebola and Google will match your donation two for
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.040]   one.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.440]   That's pretty cool.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   Google has pledged.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.920]   How many millions of dollars?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   Seven and a half million dollars.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.800]   Facebook was $35 or something.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.200]   Well, it was a bunch of dollars.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   For every dollar you give, Google will give $2.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:21.400]   They now have $5.7 million pledged on their way to the $7.5 million goal.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.320]   So Google will give up to $25 million to fight the Ebola crisis.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.000]   And people are very much responding.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   That's great.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.720]   I just threw $5 their way.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.960]   It made me feel good and tweeted it out.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   I signed up.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   I just saw it so it's really easy.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.600]   I wanted to do something about it.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.400]   If I read an article and I posted it, I think, on my Facebook page saying, "If you're
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.680]   worried about Ebola, don't elect a Republican.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.720]   Just give some money to fight Ebola in Africa."
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.120]   Because the key is to keep the number of people who have it down to treat the ones who have
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   it.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.240]   That's how you keep it from spreading.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.520]   So at that time, it was a great article on Medium.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.520]   I'll see if I can find it.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.680]   At that time, I gave money to partners in health.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.560]   They're working in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.120]   And then I started a sustaining donation to Doctors Without Borders because they do great
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.640]   stuff all around.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.040]   And they're very involved in fighting Ebola.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   Great.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.480]   But Medium on Ebola.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.440]   And it's an example of a network society.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   What's really happening here?
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.360]   And our vulnerability isn't here on our shores.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   It is over there.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.880]   And we've got to find it there.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.680]   It's Ebola, the real reason everyone should panic.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.040]   And it's by, I don't know how you pronounce her name.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   Zaneptofiski.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   Zaneptofiski.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   You know her?
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Oh, yeah, she's great.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   She's brilliant sociologist.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.800]   She is just brilliant.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.200]   And it says really the global institutions are broken.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.440]   The problem is not in here in the United States or Europe.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.280]   The problem is in Africa.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   Let's go there and fix it.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   And it's not even that expensive if we just do it.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:03.240]   And so she says at the end, so you want to do something about it, donate.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   So act, move me.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   I said good.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.160]   I gave money to Partners in Health, which she recommended and Doctors Without Borders.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.200]   And it's doing some fundraising at the end of the year, right?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   We are.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.400]   We're going to do a, not this I don't want to be self-serving, we're going to do a
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.480]   fun marathon, which we invited all of you to do.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.520]   We did it last year, our New Year's Eve marathon, but we thought if we're going to do this,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.400]   we should really make it for charity.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.800]   And I asked our team to come up with a charity that was international, was highly rated
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.600]   four or five star charity, and was doing good work with Ebola on the ground in Africa.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.680]   And we came up with the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.440]   And so, and they're going to work partner with us.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.000]   So we're going to be raising money for UNICEF from 3 AM New Year's Eve to 3 AM New Year's
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Day.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.840]   And we really try to get all of you out.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   And I'm trying to figure it out now.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   I know you guys are trying to figure out.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.440]   I know Gina couldn't, can't do it because of the baby, but next year.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.240]   I might bring you a Skype in.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.280]   Yeah, and we'll all Skype in.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.840]   All our hosts will either be here or Skype in.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.920]   And what we're really hoping to do is raise a lot of money and awareness and have some
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.000]   fun while we do it and celebrate New Year's Eve in a geeky fashion.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.560]   If it's okay, I think I'll bring Jake.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   It's encouraged.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.120]   I thought you'd like that.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.680]   We'll put Jake to work.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.880]   Oh, good.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   So it's interesting that Google and Facebook have both responded.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.200]   I have to think this medium post had something to do with that.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   Really?
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.920]   I feel like she's amazing.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   And she's highly respected in geek world.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.280]   Zanep knows her stuff.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   Zanep, she's Turkish and really brought from a perspective on the network world there.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.240]   And she just understands the sociology of the net brilliantly.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.040]   I'm a huge fan of hers.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.240]   So when you log into Facebook, you've probably already seen a retangular box that says we
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.520]   can help stop Ebola.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.200]   That's support organizations working in West Africa so they can stop the disease and save
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   lives.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.360]   Again, the focus on stopping it in Africa where it's really a problem and people are
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:07.080]   really sick instead of worrying about quarantining nurses in New Jersey.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.800]   And they're asking for donations to the International Medical Corps to save the children or to the
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.200]   Now let's note that we are now with a doctor in New York was led out of the hospital like
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   yesterday.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.320]   Because now, I mean, the United States is now free of known cases.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.160]   All the panics that occurred two weeks.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.960]   Terrible, terrible.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.000]   Zuckerberg donating $25 million of his own dollars.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.680]   So Google is doing the same and Mark is $25 million.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.800]   So that's awesome.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.360]   I think that's great.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:44.760]   This is when our community is doing a good thing and I'm proud to be a part of that.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.400]   Now I want to talk about the proposition, the proposal President Obama floated on Monday
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.840]   for solving the net neutrality crisis and get your opinions.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.880]   This is the beginning of a very of a long conversation, I think.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.680]   But first a word from brain tree.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.760]   If you're a developer or a manager of a mobile app and you're looking for a way to include
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:18.360]   payments, you need to know about brain tree, a great way to add their new V dot zero SDK
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:27.600]   will allow you to add Apple pay, PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo, and all major credit and debit
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.080]   cards to your app in just a few lines of code.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.220]   You'll be able to support 130 plus different currencies.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.420]   It supports all your favorite languages and dot net, node dot JS Java, Pearl, PHP, Python,
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.420]   and Ruby.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.700]   In fact, they'll even handle the integration for you and walk you through it.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.740]   Android iOS JavaScript clients, it makes it easy to accept payments in a way that your
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.580]   users are thrilled about.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:32:00.680]   70% of shopping cart transactions stop before the purchase of the product.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.860]   People just get frustrated by the experience.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.260]   This solves it.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.980]   An easy way to accept multiple payment types on mobile with a simple integration.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.900]   You're going to love this and I invite you to visit braintreepayments.com/twit.

[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   tree?

[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   Uber uses brain tree.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   Airbnb uses brain tree.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.980]   They started with GitHub at the very beginning and they grew with GitHub.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.140]   They've all scaled really from early stage startups to successful companies with brain

[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:27.140]   So President Obama as a campaign promise said, we're going to preserve a free and open
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   internet.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.700]   It's one of the most important technologies in the modern world.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.220]   Didn't seem to do much about it.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:40.780]   In fact, appointed as chairman of the FCC, a fellow that maybe some of us might have felt
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:47.700]   wasn't really going to look out for our best interests.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.820]   Actually he did in some ways.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.820]   The FCC-
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.060]   There was a great tweet.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.740]   I forget who did it this week.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.980]   It was Matthew Keys said that he had was trying to split the, can't figure out how to split
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.300]   the baby and someone said, oh good, a dead baby.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.260]   I feel like Tom Wheeler, you know, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, was a lobbyist we
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.500]   know for the cable companies and the wireless companies.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.220]   He's in the hall of fame of both.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.060]   So I had very little faith in him.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.700]   And yet I feel like he has been trying the FCC for maybe I'm misreading it.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.700]   But the FCC-
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   Well, I think Obama gave him cover.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.820]   I think that's what happened here is that he's trying to play both sides.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.420]   And Obama, what the hell, he has no Congress, he has no Senate, so what does he have to
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   lose?
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.260]   And by changing, pardon me, I guess, AT&T just turned off my lights.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.260]   Well, get your Travis.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.660]   Go away on the other.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.420]   And so in a way it gives him cover to say, okay, well, here's where the bar is.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.460]   Obama put the bar up here, which is neutral's neutral.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:56.540]   So the FCC proposed open internet rules for rising immediately sued.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:02.740]   The judge looked at him and said, look, FCC, you have a mandate from Congress.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.700]   Your mandate does not allow you to impose these rules.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.260]   So we're going to have to agree with Verizon, but nudge, nudge.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:16.380]   If you look at the Telecommunication Act, you'll see a thing called Title II that allows
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:22.220]   you the FCC to declare internet service providers to be common carriers.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:28.900]   And if you do that, we can assure you that will be fine with us.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.620]   The judge really gave them a roadmap.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.740]   Now then remember Wheeler made a proposal, which we, everybody was very upset about.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.980]   They received, oh, what is it?
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.020]   1.7 million comments in their open comment period.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:46.820]   I mean, the most, for almost anything except the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, which
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.100]   really is a problem.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.220]   But they, they still kind of fencing around with this.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.780]   So Obama on Monday said, you know what?
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   Well, then we'll be tight on it.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   We'll be tight on it.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.580]   One more step between, before Obama, didn't Wheeler come out with this idea of, of, yes,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.420]   maybe, I being neutral for Netflix, but not neutral for consumer?
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:14.100]   He said, we will, we will protect the interconnects, the behind the scenes stuff.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.300]   The, and you saw this happen with Comcast, which slowly throttled down Netflix until
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.260]   all of the Netflix customers on Comcast said, well, this experience sucks.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.860]   And Comcast said, okay, we'll pay you.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.020]   They basically blackmailed Comcast into paying them.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.580]   That's what Comcast thinks anyway.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.980]   And although I have to say there's, there's arguments on both sides.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.860]   I don't, I don't think it's that clear.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.060]   So Wheeler said, okay, we'll protect that.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.500]   The interconnects, we'll protect the behind the scenes stuff.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.380]   But we want to stay out of the public internet.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.620]   I actually don't think that that's necessarily a bad idea, but Obama came in and said, nope,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.580]   title two, but he also said, but you don't have to fully enforce it.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.580]   So,
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.580]   What's an example?
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:03.540]   What's an example of discriminatory service on the consumer end that you think is tolerable?
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540]   Well here's, okay.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.620]   So, by the way, we're going to do a big debate on this on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:14.380]   We have Brett Glass, who is a firebrand and an internet service provider in Wyoming.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.380]   He's an ISP.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.620]   He's also been a tech journalist.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.940]   He's an ISP.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:23.300]   And he says any regulation at all of the internet is going to be a problem.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.500]   You don't want government fiddling with the internet because they don't understand it.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.820]   It's a, it's a blunt instrument.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.700]   And if you regulate internet service providers as carriers, you're going to make it far worse
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700]   than it is.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.700]   We will get on somebody.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.700]   I don't know who we have.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.700]   Did we try to get Neil?
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.700]   I have to tell.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.700]   We have Dane.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.180]   Dane Jasper, who is the CEO of SonicNet, another internet.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.860]   It's actually a good guy to get on the other side because he's also an internet service
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.940]   provider.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.700]   And I think he can argue the other side.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.700]   I hope he can.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.700]   He absolutely can.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.100]   He's been very, very, very, very much looking forward to it.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.420]   So, we'll have a debate between internet service providers about whether they should
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.420]   be regulated as carriers.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.020]   Of course, there's an argument here.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.980]   The Al Franken argument from a couple of years ago was held by Southwest is the net neutrality
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.780]   is not trying to regulate the internet.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:14.260]   It's trying to stop the ISPs from changing the architecture of the net.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.780]   I, you know what?
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.500]   I would love it if Title II would just boom, solve this problem.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.660]   I remember talking to John Perry Barlow, founder of EFF.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.940]   He said even the EFF board is very split on this.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.660]   Some of us are just anti-government.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.100]   We don't think the government can do a very good job.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.100]   The internet moves too fast, is too technical.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.380]   We just don't feel like government is the right solution.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:41.860]   But we also recognize that just leaving it up to Comcast Verizon and AT&T isn't a great
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   solution either.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.940]   I mean, I think we all agree that what we really wish we had was real competition.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.820]   If there were 10 choices, it wouldn't be a problem.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.540]   I think that's what that has to be the barrier.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.620]   Until we have some measure of true competition, there's temporary regulation in place to preserve
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.620]   certain rights.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:03.220]   Under the belief that competition will then deal with this.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.660]   And the arguments that the phone companies are making, of course, is that, of course,
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.540]   they have huge profits even in these capital intensive businesses.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.980]   But they argue that we're not going to invest.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.860]   But they seemingly are investing.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:20.340]   And if the barrier is, if the bar is set at a competitive level, it says regulation will
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.540]   come off when you are this competitive.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:29.940]   Well, okay, I'm going to channel somebody like Jerry Pournell who's a right-wing libertarian
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:36.340]   who would say, "When have you ever seen the government give up any regulation once imposed?"
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.980]   In other words, once you give the FCC the power to regulate, are they very likely to
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.780]   say, "Hey, God, there's competition now.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.780]   Have fun, guys.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   We're stopped."
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.420]   Well, you can sunset it in that way.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.980]   I mean, listen, I'm not a libertarian sometimes.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.100]   I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.980]   I think there's a role for government in certain places and not in other places.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.140]   And I scream generally about the government staying the hell out of the Internet.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.380]   And I generally agree with that.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.020]   What about those who argue there isn't any problem right now?
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.020]   Everything working pretty well.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.060]   I mean, yeah, Comcast put the screws to Netflix, but Netflix is still making money.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.900]   They were able to pay those interconnect fees.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.500]   It's working now.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.540]   In other words, it's a form of techno panic to use your own phrase.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.980]   I think that's fair, but I also think that at this point, and I just have my rant about
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.660]   a phone company of the month, but if cable companies and telephone companies think that
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:39.300]   we're going to side with them and give them empathy, man, it's time to pay the Piper,
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   guys.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.140]   You've been treating us like prisoners and like crap for years and nickel and diamond
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   us and set in all your own rules and not operate in an open way.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.180]   And now you expect us to sign with you?
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.740]   We have no trust in you.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.180]   Sorry, AT&T, you do not have the most reliable 4G network.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   And I got the proof.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:03.100]   Sorry, cable companies, you throttle us and I know your margins on Internet are unbelievable
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:07.820]   and you bundle us and screw us in all kinds of ways and you don't give us good service.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.540]   No, we're not going to sympathize with you.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.140]   We're not going to leave the Internet in your hands.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:18.620]   But I want to also point out that Title II doesn't say anything about paid prioritization,
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.940]   which is really the issue here.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   Yes.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   And it does impose all sorts of interesting.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.900]   I'm nervous about that part too.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   I agree.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.420]   Maybe that's a marvelous point about selective enforcement.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.500]   Maybe you just set the principles to say these are the principles that we will enforce.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:44.180]   Well, Title II, and this is the key thing, Title II Section 202 says, "Common carriers,"
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.660]   and this would make ISPs common carriers, "can't make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:55.220]   and charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities or services."
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.900]   So Michael Weinberg of Public Knowledge says, "Under Title II, the FCC would be free to
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.860]   create blanket rules that prohibit problematic discrimination."
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.820]   But I know already that Brett Glass is going to come on and say, "Yeah, that's fine, but
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:14.060]   let me tell you some of the other things Title II requires."
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.700]   There are a lot of arcane provisions.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.900]   Spires or enables.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.900]   Huh?
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.260]   Requires or enables.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:28.780]   Well the commission says, "For bear, we will selectively not enforce certain features
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.700]   of Title II."
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.900]   And so that's the thing, do you trust them to enforce just the good stuff and not everything?
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.380]   Because that's the heart of the matter right there.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.900]   Who do you trust more?
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.700]   The government to be involved or the carriers themselves to not take advantage of the current
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   situation.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.700]   And I think that's the big split right there.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.700]   Right.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.620]   I don't trust either of them.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.620]   Exactly.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:57.140]   I guess if I had to pick one, I guess I'd pick the government, but God knows.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.060]   For one thing, they're clearly influenced by the dollars donated by...
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.660]   I would pick companies in a competitive marketplace hands down.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.660]   Right.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.660]   Absolutely.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.660]   But in an absolutely competitive marketplace, I have issues.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.940]   Now people will say, "Oh, Jarvis, what about you and Google when you defend them?"
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.340]   Well they're in a competitive marketplace and everything except advertising.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.340]   But there are fact choices.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.340]   We are not imprisoned.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.260]   We as users, as post advertisers, are not imprisoned by Google.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.500]   We are imprisoned by the terms of phone companies and cable companies.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:34.020]   That's me, is the difference.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.660]   We're going to have a heck of a debate on Sunday.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:42.580]   I have a lot of prep work to do because this is a very complicated subject.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.020]   That's going to be a good show, yeah.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.900]   Glad you're doing it.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.820]   Well I think we kind of have to.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.740]   And even in our own audience, it's very split about how to solve it.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.100]   I think we all generally agree if there were competition, we wouldn't have to worry because
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.660]   if Comcast were screwing you, you'd have somewhere else to go.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.580]   Comcast has been able to gobble up even more.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.300]   Well, and by the way, that was with the help and support of the Federal Communications
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   Commission.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.900]   You actually gave them a monopoly.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.060]   Now the argument, if you go back in time, was, "Well, Comcast said, "Well, we're not
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   going to build out our system unless we have a monopoly in each region."
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.980]   And the FCC felt like, "Well, if we're going to let these guys to build this, you
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:34.100]   know, this infrastructure, we've got to give them a monopoly."
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:39.980]   It's very interesting.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.620]   And I think that we all kind of need to understand it as best we can.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:51.140]   Matthew Inman did, of course, a famous oatmeal, response to Ted Cruz's tweet, "Net neutrality
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.380]   is Obamacare for the Internet.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.100]   The Internet should not operate at the speed of government."
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.380]   And then Matthew said, "This led me to assume one of two things.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:03.860]   Thing one, when you accepted campaign funds, Ted Cruz from telecom lobbyists last year,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.380]   they asked that you publicly smear net neutrality.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.580]   Thing two, you actually don't know what net neutrality is."
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.060]   I love this guy.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.060]   He's great.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.460]   He says, "I can't do anything about thing one instead.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.540]   Let me explain what net neutrality is."
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:25.660]   The problem is all of these very kind of simplistic explanations make a huge amount of sense.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.100]   We've seen so many of these.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.620]   But this isn't what's happening.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.420]   And I'm not sure that this is, he even says this is an extreme scenario, not a very likely
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:36.420]   one.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.940]   Well, even the New York Times had a headline this week about, "What's the really simple
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.180]   way to understand net neutrality?"
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.220]   It's not that complex.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.420]   If you oversimplify it, you ruin it too.
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.300]   And the New York Times piece was not bad.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.180]   It was a fine explanation.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.460]   And I think Matthew is very smart.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.100]   He did a great job.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.220]   He says, "Net neutrality is a bipartisan issue because net neutrality isn't about control.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.980]   It's about freedom."
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:10.620]   And it seems to me if you are conservative and you believe that innovation is going to
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.380]   keep this country economically vital, then you must believe in the internet and a free
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.860]   on federal internet too.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.540]   But of course, remember, conservatives just don't trust government.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.980]   I have to say, Ted Cruz is against it.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.980]   I'm for it.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.900]   Personally, that helps me make it in choice.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   But I think it's actually very complicated.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.780]   But the American here that says anything Obama touches gets political kudos.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.860]   Yeah, maybe by saying what he said.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.420]   Because now he's provided a target.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.500]   Do you think it was covered for Tom Wheeler?
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.780]   In a way, yeah, Wheeler can seem more reasonable or I'll figure it out.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.140]   Otherwise, it's now going to be known as the Obama net.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.540]   Well, right.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:05.500]   What we do know that Comcast for Verizon and AT&T hate Title II, which is another good reason
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   to do it.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.300]   Well, now there's now Wheeler has negotiating power.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   That's a good point.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.260]   Okay, folks, the president of the United States and a lot of people, 1.X million, are
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.260]   after you.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.260]   Let's actually talk now.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:24.420]   Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe that could be a very savvy political move there.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.620]   But I don't think the problem is the idea that he's going to negotiate that neutrality
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:34.460]   with a telephone company is because that alone makes my skin crawl.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.360]   Such a challenge.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:42.580]   In areas where there are multiple Internet service providers, I do believe that things
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.820]   are better.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:49.220]   But in general, in the United States, something like 80% of all Americans only have two choices
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.220]   is your phone company.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.380]   I have my files.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:57.020]   And my files is better than my cable setup was.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.540]   And the two of them have each other for features.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.180]   And yeah, I think it improves it immensely.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   That's only two.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.180]   That's still a little opely.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.180]   Right.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.860]   And let's face it, both Verizon and Comcast are kind of in bed on this one.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.980]   The New York Times argument was basically was arguing that it was the net neutrality
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.300]   is the power company.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.860]   And we turn on the power, we don't know where it comes from and we get to pay a bill.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.220]   That's the British model where BT does the last mile and anybody can sell you service
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.220]   over it.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.220]   We're not anywhere near that.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.620]   Well, that's the thing is we can think of solutions.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.540]   Competition, government owned Internet, that kind of thing.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:40.300]   A lot of people, including Bob Frankston, Bob Frankston, the guy who created VisiCalc,
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.060]   one of the guys who created VisiCalc, are advocating for local municipalities to just use their
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.820]   right of eminent domain to take over the Internet wiring in that town.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.420]   Say we own this, it's a public utility and we're going to let any company that wants
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.180]   to provide Internet service over these wires do it.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.660]   And that would be a great solution.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:04.100]   But none of these are likely to happen in most areas.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.340]   We found out why the Google barges didn't fly.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.380]   They were fire hazards.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:19.620]   The Coast Guard said these barges, these were the member of these barges that appeared in
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.020]   Portland, Maine and San Francisco.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.220]   We didn't know what they were.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.820]   They were supposedly floating showrooms for Google.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.380]   Crazy, millions of dollars spent on these barges.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   The barges that they bought to re-condition alone cost something like four and a half
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.380]   million.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:40.420]   Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US Coast Guard repeatedly raised fire safety
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.420]   concerns.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.180]   Google could not answer.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.660]   They warned that the barges would have over 5,000 gallons of fuel on the main deck right
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.580]   next to a substantial amount of combustible material.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.020]   They're floating bombs.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:06.140]   You've got your Chromebook aisle, your Nexus aisle and your fuel aisle.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.620]   And in fact, they dismantled and sold the Portland barge for scrap in August and they
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.060]   have moved the San Francisco barge in so much for the barges.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.540]   I think Christopher Mims, I think, is the columnist for the Journal did the story.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.300]   On Twitter, he was arguing this was an act of hubris, technology hubris.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:27.620]   I said maybe, but I often imagine his right hand left hand, not so much that we can get
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.620]   away with this.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.620]   It's just somebody did something.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.540]   The company is just too darn big now.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:37.580]   Here's an example of government regulation working exactly like it's supposed to.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.620]   True enough.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.620]   Barge neutrality.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.620]   Here's another question.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.260]   No, there's a barge.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.500]   Barge is it I thought were pushed by tow truck.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.500]   Toe truck.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   Yeah, I don't know why they have fuel.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.500]   I don't know.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   Right.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.500]   What do they have fuel?
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.500]   Apparently they did.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.060]   Google didn't dispute the point.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.300]   Yeah, we got 5,000 gallons of fuel.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.300]   What's your problem?
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.300]   We'll sell it off.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.300]   Okay.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   100% project.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.300]   You're right.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.300]   It could blow up.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.300]   It could blow up.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   I never thought it.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   Never mind.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.300]   Whoops.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.860]   Google has a Google drive for genomes.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.860]   That's interesting.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.580]   Remember they killed their health.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.620]   That was more of a consumer level.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.380]   Yeah, this is aimed at hospitals and universities.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:35.460]   It's the big genomic data on Google Cloud platform.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.460]   Google Genomics.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.540]   Boy these guys think big.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:44.020]   And yeah, wow.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.180]   Got to love them.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:52.020]   cloud.google.com/genomics if you would like to explore genetic variation interactively.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.180]   Hey, he's gonna be out of it.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.180]   Who doesn't?
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.180]   And who doesn't?
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.900]   Compare entire cohorts in seconds with SQLite queries.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:05.420]   Compute transition, transversion, ratios, genome-wide, association, allelic frequency
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.420]   and more.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.820]   Have we got a cloud for you?
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.780]   It's easy to sign up.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.300]   If you don't already have a Google account, make one.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.740]   Wow.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:26.580]   So you have to download the Java client jar file.
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.100]   It's all done in Java.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:35.260]   Let's say I want to do the change login in the mood.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.260]   Let's do it.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   All right.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.260]   Let's do it.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   Before we do that?
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.260]   No.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.260]   Oh, sorry.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.260]   That's cool.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.260]   I thought that was the throw in the business.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.260]   A tease, not a throw.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.260]   Sorry, I got it.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:54.260]   It's a tease, not a throw.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:00.300]   Our show today brought to you by personal capital, personal capital.com.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.260]   And I can understand.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.220]   You might say, well, I'm going to get a little bit of a break.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.020]   I'm going to give them all my personal financial information.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.180]   The back end on this is exactly the same when your bank uses.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.100]   They already know all your personal financial information.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:21.340]   But what you do, once you enter all this stuff in, stocks, investments, mortgages, loans,
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.700]   assets, bank accounts, checking accounts, you're going to get a great, a beautiful dashboard.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.020]   So you see exactly where your money is, where it's going.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.180]   You can even use this for budgeting, which is great.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.180]   They have apps for all the devices, including Android Wear Watch Apps.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:40.220]   So you can get the notifications about your investments as you walk around town.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.100]   Personal capital will show you how much you're overpaying in fees, how to reduce those
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   fees.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.900]   It will get you tailored advice, optimizing your investments, plan for the future from
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.940]   the most granular budgeting all the way up to, what am I going to do when I retire?
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.820]   This is great.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.820]   Why wait?

[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.100]   Great way to invest personalcapital.com.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.980]   Now, the throw.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.660]   It's time for the Google change log.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:33.660]   The Google change log.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.700]   Peter Travani has the latest from Google.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:44.300]   Google voice users, you now get MMS support on Verizon, Verizon Wireless users and native
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   support.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.740]   So now this means that Google voice now has supports MMS, all the major carriers in the
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.220]   US and Canada.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:55.500]   And if you're using Hangouts with Google voice, you can send these messages natively.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.980]   You're not going to get a link to an image.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.420]   It all shows up right there in your SMS client the way you would, you know, in Hangouts the
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   way that you would expect.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   So it looks like the only thing we're waiting on at this point is group messaging via MMS.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.780]   And that apparently will be enabled in a future update.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.620]   So Google voice, get in the MMS going on.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.420]   Yeah, yeah, good news.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.980]   Google Drive has been optimized for iOS 8.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.900]   So a couple of nice updates for iOS users.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.900]   You can now open files from Drive and say back to Drive from other apps on your device
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.660]   if you're using iOS 8.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.700]   You can use Touch ID now to unlock Drive.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:40.580]   There was the ability to pass code lock drive out for a while, but now you get Touch ID.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:46.620]   And you can add videos that you store on Google Drive to your iOS device as well.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.020]   You can save videos from Drive to your devices.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.740]   Camera roll, you just tap the file and then say open in and choose save video and you
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.220]   can save it to your camera roll.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.140]   That's pretty nice.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:04.140]   The keyboard was updated with material themes and Lollipop's Messenger app is now in the
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.780]   Play Store.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:11.580]   So of course the Google keyboard now, it got a couple of, it shipped, there was a refresh
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.740]   and update which included light and dark material design themes.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.180]   You don't see them by default.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:21.420]   You have to go into settings and select which theme you want to use if you want to see them.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:25.620]   And the Messenger app which has been introduced in Lollipop is now available in the Play Store.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:30.340]   So if you have a device running Android 4.1 or higher, you can download Messenger now.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.340]   It's not a replacement for Hangouts.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:36.460]   This is the app that ships kind of baked into Android 5.0 Lollipop.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.260]   It just gives you kind of plain J and SMS, N M M S capabilities.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.260]   That's the place to run out.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.460]   It's frustrating because basically Google wants you to use Hangouts.
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.980]   Yeah, they, right, it's a little confusing, right?
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.820]   They want you to use Hangouts, but messaging is if you don't want to use Hangouts.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.300]   You don't want to merge those together.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.180]   Hangouts should work that good.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   Hangouts should work that good.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.180]   And I should look in Lollipop.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.620]   Yeah, I mean, it looks similar.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.540]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.540]   I was thinking Messenger.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:08.500]   Yeah, it's almost like now Hangouts design feels a little bit behind some of the other
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   things.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.500]   It was like one of the first to jump and now there's Lollipop.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.700]   It doesn't look any better at all.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.420]   It looks exactly the same in Hangouts.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.300]   Yeah, no, the Hangouts definitely looks the same.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.740]   Yeah, yeah, Hangouts doesn't look the same.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.700]   Hangouts hasn't gotten the material design treatment quite yet.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.700]   No, it's numbers.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.500]   I'm starting to populate fake information.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.700]   It takes a long time to do that, by the way.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.260]   Yeah, thank you for doing that.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.260]   I might steal your--
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.260]   That's what I want to do.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.260]   That's what I want to do.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.940]   Numbers and my information on the air.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.700]   I want to create a dummy account that everybody can use.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.260]   Yeah, that's a good idea, right, with context.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.260]   Go ahead.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.540]   Yeah, and I think part of the thing with the Messenger update too, it is kind of confusing
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.100]   because it was this unified thing.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.860]   Hey, everybody use Hangouts.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.540]   This is the future, but that doesn't help for a OSP, right, because Hangouts is kind
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.540]   of a close source.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.100]   No, you have to have a message.
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   Exactly.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.100]   Right.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.100]   Right.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:08.020]   And finally, we were talking about this a little bit pre-show.
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:12.300]   Android 5.0 Lollipop begins rolling out over the air to Nexus devices.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.340]   I believe that tweet went out today.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.540]   So the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7, both generations, but not the LTE 3G version quite yet.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.860]   And the Nexus 10 are coming out.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.420]   I think they tweeted out this afternoon.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.460]   They're starting to roll out now over the next few hours.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.700]   Yeah, we just keep tapping that check now button.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.900]   Apparently, there's nothing but what the heck.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:40.620]   It's like when you add an elevator, you keep tapping the up button.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.460]   Come on, come on, elevator hurry up.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.700]   Of course, I was going to save this for my tip, but I might as well just say, Google
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.580]   did release the factory images as downloads.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.460]   So if you want to just go ahead and install it yourself, you can do that if you're willing
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.460]   to deal.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.700]   You know, it is just a pain.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.700]   You have to solve it.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   You have to ruin it.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.460]   No, you have to have an unlocked bootloader, but you don't have to root.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.460]   I mean, it's basically--
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.660]   The next seven bootloader is surely not locked.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:08.660]   Yeah, I think they're all unlocked the next ones.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.660]   All right.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.140]   If you do flash that, though, you're going to lose your data.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.900]   That's on your device automatically.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.900]   Oh.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.540]   Unless you get it from OT and I think there is actually a way to--
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.620]   I need to flash those that you don't lose the data.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.620]   I don't know.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.420]   We'll just end up doing it.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.420]   Personally, I'm waiting for the OTA because I'd rather just--
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.420]   It's easy to see.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   --because I'm lazy.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   It's six counts.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.380]   Yeah, you still need the Android developer tools and such to do the flashing.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.180]   So I-- over the air is much easier.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.180]   Oh, well.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.180]   Yeah, I'm over the air is way easier.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.180]   If you're patient.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.180]   No, we're not.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.180]   That's the problem.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.180]   That's the problem.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.180]   That's the problem.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.180]   That's the problem.
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.180]   That's the problem.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.180]   Anything else?
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.180]   That's it.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.180]   That's all I got.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.220]   And that's the Google Change Law.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:59.420]   Now, supposedly, Motorola did a post on its blog that they are also pushing updates for
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.900]   the G and the X this year and last years.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.180]   And somebody in our chat room has a MotoX Pure Edition, which is the one you get on
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.980]   Moto Maker with the T-Mobile Sim.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.300]   And apparently, that has-- his was updated.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.980]   So it's a rolling-- as always, they're rolling updates.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.380]   They don't update all the phones at once.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.380]   Just keep on--
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.020]   Yeah, they don't-- they can't release all the terabytes.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020]   That's the problem.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020]   That's the problem.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   That's the problem.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   The problem is that they don't have to do it.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.020]   They don't have to do it.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:48.020]   Remember we talked a little bit about Taylor Swift's snubbing Spotify saying I don't want
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.020]   to give the impression that I give away my music for free.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:58.020]   She made sure her most recent album 1989, I think all of her music is no longer available
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020]   on Spotify.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:05.020]   She says streaming is a grand experiment, but I'm not willing to contribute my life's work
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.020]   to an experiment.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.020]   I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, and artists, and creators of this
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.020]   year.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:15.020]   Meanwhile, Daniel Eke, the chief executive at Spotify says, a tailor, you might want
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:24.340]   to ask your label about that because this year we have paid $2 billion in royalties and
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:33.020]   he estimated that he had paid at least $6 million this year to Taylor Swift.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.700]   The problem is it's not Taylor Swift's money.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:43.620]   It goes to the label Big Machine and if Big Machine doesn't share it with Taylor, that's
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.100]   not Spotify's fault.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.100]   Leo, if you go to medium.com/atsignpud.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.340]   I love Philip Kaplan.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.660]   He wrote a wonderful piece about this.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.380]   She argues that the entire music industry was a grand experiment that lasted only a pleasure
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380]   of years.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.900]   But thank you, bud.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.260]   It's amazing that the old record industry existed in the first place, he says.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.980]   The record industry has a history of ripping off artists, period.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.140]   This doesn't surprise me in the least.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:26.780]   It's very important that Spotify, Daniel stepped right up and said, "You know what?
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.620]   We do pay money."
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:34.780]   We had on Twit last Sunday, Rob Reed, who started this whole thing, he founded Rhapsody.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.260]   He said, "We didn't know what to charge, but we talked to the labels.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:43.060]   We talked to artists and it seemed to all involve that if you could get a user," and
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:46.980]   remember this is in an appster era too, there was stealing going on.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.860]   If you can get a user to pay $10 a month like clockwork, there's more money overall
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.820]   in the pie, more artists can get more money overall than if you say, "Well, no, we're
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   never going to do that.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.460]   We're only going to sell music."
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460]   He was right.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460]   I mean, users love it.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.100]   He was the one at Rhapsody was on to set that $10 price, which has been pretty much written
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.220]   in stone ever since.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:13.660]   I mean, $2 billion in payments from Spotify to labels this year alone, that's almost
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.580]   doubled from last year.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:22.860]   I think the system works.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.780]   I don't think the music industry works, and I would agree with put on that.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.340]   He says, "Motsar didn't sell one copy.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.260]   Taylor Swift sold $110 million."
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.420]   When record stores were a thing, there were exactly 60 musicians who figured out how to
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.940]   work within the system become wildly successful.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.780]   60, six zero musicians who sold 100 million copies or more.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.180]   He says, "But that was because they took advantage of its inefficiencies in the market."
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.580]   How many of those millions of people only wanted one track but had to buy the entire
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.580]   album?
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.100]   There you go.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.740]   How many of those millions put the album on a shelf and never listened to it by removing
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.740]   herself from streaming services, which by the way, she didn't do.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.460]   She only removed herself from Spotify.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.220]   She's still on audio and everything.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.460]   Taylor Swift is intentionally adding inefficiency back into the market.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.460]   Well, she can.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.700]   She's on top, right?
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.220]   Like Comcast, her product is...
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.060]   And by the way, we had Damon Wayans on triangulation on Monday.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.820]   It's exactly what he said as well.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.420]   He said, "Someone like Taylor Swift can do that.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.260]   But what about all the artists who nobody's ever heard of?
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.300]   They get a lot of Spotify."
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.300]   He said, "He said too.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.300]   It's the record labels.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.780]   They're the ones keeping the money.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.620]   Like Comcast, her product is popular enough.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.700]   People will put up with it.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.620]   And when I believe an artist gets to choose what happens to her art, I still think it's
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.340]   a dick move to her fans."
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.340]   Really?
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.380]   I don't know.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:48.580]   I think it's great that Taylor is in such a position of power where she can make that
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   decision.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:58.460]   It seems like that came from a place where she said, "I feel like we're creating this
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.340]   music and we should get more value out of it."
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:02.340]   I don't know.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.340]   I think that someone in her position...
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   That is old for me.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.820]   She makes a fortune for her tours.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.820]   She absolutely does.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.820]   But see, this is the thing.
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.620]   I didn't think that this was about her.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:15.740]   I feel like she knew that she was in a position because she sells so well that if she said
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.580]   something, people would make a big deal about it.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.580]   And they did.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.860]   They also bought 1.3 million copies of 1989.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.660]   Maybe because some of those people couldn't get it any other way.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.660]   What is purely...
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.660]   What is she doing?
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.660]   A purely greedy move.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660]   $12 a month?
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.820]   Does she want to charge $15 a month?
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.260]   She just doesn't want streaming at all and only wants to do what record stores did for
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.700]   a limited time in this country?
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   That's the problem is, "Okay, what's your solution?
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.260]   The whining of, I deserve to be paid more for my creativity.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.020]   Okay, but the world's changed."
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.820]   A lot of artists don't like Spotify.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:59.020]   But I think they need to call their label and say, "Hey, dude, those big checks are getting
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.540]   from Spotify."
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.620]   I think probably this is a question of bad contracts.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.900]   Contracts that didn't consider digital distribution and streaming.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.380]   And I think the record companies have once again screwed artists.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.180]   This is nothing new.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:18.820]   So, Gina, because I cut you off and I should have done that.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.340]   What do you think that has happened before?
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:28.140]   What do you think that the streaming services should be doing?
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:36.740]   Well, I think it's good for someone to question the economics of it, particularly her because
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.420]   it made waves.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.460]   I don't know what the solution is.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.820]   It was interesting to me that someone who reaches Sony people, I mean, of course, she
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.740]   knew she was going to reach her fans no matter what.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:53.100]   Her fans were going to get the music, however they needed to get it.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.820]   And other artists aren't just in that position to do that.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:01.780]   But I think most artists are just at the mercy of whoever will distribute their work on whatever
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.620]   terms because they just want to get out there.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:11.300]   Jeff, would you consider putting your book on oyster books or somewhere like that where
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.180]   they charge $10 a month and you can read any book in their life?
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.100]   I think that my book is going to be entirely free on medium.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.860]   OK, you're the wrong guy to ask.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.860]   The whole book.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.900]   But what do you think about authors?
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.820]   I mean, oyster books is a basically spotify for books.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   Yeah, try it.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   Why not?
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.660]   I mean, that's what Amazon's argument is, is if you lower the price point, you're going
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.660]   to increase the sales.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.460]   You're going to, I mean, part of what you want to do as a writer or a singer is you
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.460]   want to reach more people.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.340]   Well, Rob's point was if you're getting very clear here, so I want to get in trouble with
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340]   my family.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.740]   My daughter is a gigantic Taylor Swift fan.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   I love Taylor Swift.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   We're showing Philadelphia.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.620]   She puts out an amazing show.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.380]   That is her scarcity now.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.380]   She announced her tour.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.500]   I even my wife immediately said, oh, get your finger ready.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.980]   We're going to be hitting refresh, refresh, refresh on the order screen.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.220]   We're trying to get tickets.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.060]   It'll be worse than trying to get a Nexus 6.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.500]   She's created a tremendous scarcity there, huge tour.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.620]   The more fans she has, the better off she is.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.500]   I think I've talked about Paolo Quelho on this show before.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.580]   He sold 125 million books.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.260]   Ungodly amazing.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.740]   He's pirated his own books because when he found that new people would discover him
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:20.180]   in a new country, it would lead to more sales.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.180]   We're not ready to say that we know what the economic model of music or media should
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.780]   be because just because of what it was.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.700]   I'm not saying that it's right where it is now.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.700]   It's not.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.340]   But neither was it necessarily right before for the current reality.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.100]   We need to experiment with more things.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.700]   Nothing that says you're going to get paid what you used to get paid.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:43.300]   But I think Pud's point too is it was a tremendous blockbuster-based business.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:48.620]   The variety we have now is greater than we had when artists had to go through the continent.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.580]   Taylor Swift, God bless her, is the blockbuster of blockbusters right now.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.780]   She's not representative of music.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.660]   That's absolutely true.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.620]   One question I have and I don't really know the answer.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.100]   I would imagine she probably makes a lot more from the touring than she does from the album
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.100]   sales anyway.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.460]   It all depends on the contracts.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:12.100]   I think it's a top artist like Taylor Swift is on track to exceed $6 million a year from
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100]   Spotify.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100]   From Spotify.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.340]   I've got to believe she makes more than that.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.580]   Yeah, but that's one.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.580]   That's one.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.740]   There's multiple streaming services.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.740]   True.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.180]   This is not an insignificant flow of money.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.180]   The point Rob Reed was making is the music industry was very happy to say, "Oh, $10 for
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:37.060]   everybody who listens, that's going to be more than we get selling CDs."
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.860]   They were very happy, especially in the world where people were starting to pirate like
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.860]   crazy.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.300]   Music sales are down 14% this year.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:50.060]   Digital music sales are down 14% this year already.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.980]   I think this is viable.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:10:01.140]   I think Taylor Swift actually is a data point that's fun, that was driven really by the
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:05.540]   promotional needs, not anything else.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:09.700]   If there's a problem, it's because the record labels are keeping too much, not because they're
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.380]   not making money.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:17.980]   It's always been a slimy business.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.900]   The head of her record label, Scott Borchetta, said that they wanted to restrict access to
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:28.580]   Spotify's paid tier, but Spotify said, "No, we won't do that."
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.580]   What does that mean?
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:36.820]   Well, there's free Spotify with ads, so there's revenue still, and there's premium Spotify,
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   that's the $10 a month.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:43.980]   I would guess almost all music fans pay at least pay one streaming service $10 a month,
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   right?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.980]   I pay Google my $10, used to pay Spotify.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.540]   Yeah, I pay the $8 for all access.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.700]   She was rejecting the ad base, the free/ad base model.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.380]   I don't know, there's something legitimate there for me, and I think that's because I'm
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:05.580]   equating it with software and web apps, which I've been covering for years, and we went
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.780]   through this time where everything on the web was free with the idea that it would grow
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.780]   big enough to attract advertisers to support itself.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:17.220]   But now that we're several years into it, we see that that isn't sustainable.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:22.580]   Small startups get swelled up in AquaHires because they weren't able to sustain a business
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.780]   model.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.020]   It's hard to sell.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.460]   I build a subscription service.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:31.160]   It's hard to sell a subscription to consumers because folks have been trained that these
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.140]   things are free.
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:37.380]   And so it kind of puts you in this weird position where it's like, "Well, if you're making something
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:43.940]   that's really good, whether that's an app or a song or a movie or whatever it is, that
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.700]   costs money and who pays."
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.900]   And I think for her to say, "I don't want my music to be free.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.820]   I want people to pay for my music through some way, whether that's the Spotify premium
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.420]   or buying the CD or whatever."
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:03.500]   I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.580]   Other artists have pulled their music off Spotify.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.380]   I'm reading an article from David Byrne in The Guardian in which he says he's pulled
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.900]   as much of-- David Byrne was the lead man for the talking heads.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:19.660]   He's pulled as much of his music from Spotify as he can.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:26.020]   But he also says it's kind of interesting that Spotify generates profits for record
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.060]   labels and free content for consumers, but it spells disaster for artists.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:38.740]   Again, it seems to me the problem is record labels.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:43.580]   Another kind of upside down quote-- this is from, again, from Scott Borchetta of Big
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.100]   Machine Taylor Swift's label.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.620]   He says, "We don't want to embarrass the fans.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.380]   If a fan went and purchased the record, CD, iTunes, whatever, and then their friends
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.420]   go, 'Hey, dude, why'd you pay for it?
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.060]   It's free on Spotify.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.780]   We're being completely disrespectful to that super fan who wants to invest, who believes
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.580]   in their favorite artist."
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.340]   Record labels seem crazy.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:13.780]   All right.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   Anything else to say?
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.780]   We're done.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:16.780]   Oh, well.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.540]   I think we've said it all.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.980]   Actually, I didn't cover this in the changelog because I figured we would talk about it separately.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.660]   Music key, YouTube music key.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.700]   Oh, has it launched?
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.500]   Speaking of subscription music services, no, it's been announced.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.700]   I think it's going to become available in a limited beta next month.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.820]   So it's $7.99 a month.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.820]   Oh, interesting.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.620]   subscription music service, which is YouTube.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:47.900]   It'll allow, enable offline videos, background playing, ad-free.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.580]   It will eventually be $10 a month like everybody else.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.580]   Right.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.580]   Right.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.580]   And it's bundled with Google Play.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.580]   Play music, yeah.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.580]   Play music.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.580]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.580]   This is interesting.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:03.020]   So if you have Play music, it's an additional $8 a month.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.020]   Let's see.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.060]   My understanding is that if you're paying one, you're getting both.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.060]   But I--
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.060]   Yeah, correct.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.060]   I think you get both together.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.060]   Oh, that'd be nice.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.340]   Yeah, music key also includes subscription to what the company is now calling Google Play
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.340]   music.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.900]   It's Spotify, competitor, which normally sells for $9.99 a month.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.900]   You're right.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.140]   It was $9.99 a month.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.180]   And so the Google Play music, all access name is dead.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180]   [LAUGHS]
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.180]   Really?
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.180]   Oh, interesting.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.180]   So this is the new Google Play.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.180]   That's right.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.180]   Right.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.180]   Oh, what do you--
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   It's now you did--
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.180]   --you did before?
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   Video, I guess.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.180]   Music video.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.180]   Oh, I see.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.180]   OK.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.180]   Through YouTube.
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.340]   So you get ad-free-- OK, a new way to enjoy music, ad-free anytime anywhere, ad-free music
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.740]   background listening, offline playback.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.140]   Listen to this is what Susan Wojcicki is talking about.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.820]   She mentioned, I think we talked about it last week, of an ad-free YouTube paid experience.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:58.380]   YouTube.com/musickey one word.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.380]   And you have to sign up.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.580]   It's not till November 17th.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.380]   And it's going to be a private beta starting then.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.380]   Wow.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:12.620]   Oh, and you can-- oh, you're going to have a dedicated music tab on your music home page.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:18.700]   So you will have a new YouTube music tab as a subscriber.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:19.700]   So there's video discovery.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:22.140]   See, I think this is cool and smart.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.500]   By the way, look who's there, Taylor Swift.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.500]   I think--
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.500]   I think--
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:33.940]   I saw it so she can file a complaint and get the show taken down, huh?
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.940]   Should I?
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:35.940]   How about this?
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.860]   I want to play Glenn Campbell, who is in the last stages of Alzheimer's.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.340]   It's a sad story.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:47.460]   He recorded a new song, which is probably the saddest thing I've ever seen.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.660]   And yet moving and yet beautiful, called I'm Not Going to Miss You.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.380]   And it features images of Clint Campbell as a young man.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.300]   But he sings it.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:01.060]   And he talks about how the world is slipping away from him.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.060]   Oh, man.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:13.700]   It's really quite moving.
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.700]   Oh.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.540]   He's been so brave to do this publicly.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.060]   It's a little bit like Jeff,
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.260]   so, you know, talking about your prostate cancer
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.340]   and being very public about it.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.100]   And Alzheimer's is kind of a taboo subject.

[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:21.940]   - Yeah.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:24.020]   - It was like clicking clack.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.260]   They show it off, what happened,
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.100]   something you don't know what happened.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.260]   - We didn't know what happened, and then he's dead.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.260]   Yeah, Tom Maljotz.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.780]   Yeah, so thank you, Glenn Campbell
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.740]   and his family for publishing that.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:38.620]   Okay, let's continue on 'cause now I'm depressed.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.460]   - Yeah, that was the bummer.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.300]   - It's beautiful.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.140]   - I think it's something about it.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.820]   It's really like touching.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.660]   - All right, I got--
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:47.500]   - Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.340]   - Go ahead, do something.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.940]   Say something. - No, 'cause I got no number,
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:51.540]   someone needed this for my number, I will fake it.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.660]   - Save your number.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.780]   Save your number.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.100]   Is there anything we missed?
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.580]   Kevin, any story you wanna talk about?
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.820]   The Moto 360 available in metal today?
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.180]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.780]   As is, you know what, not a lot of people
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.420]   realize the Sony smartwatch just came out this week
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.980]   and nobody's talking about it.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.140]   Yeah, the smartwatch three.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.580]   - Well, it's interesting to me on this one.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.340]   It's the only one with GPS, which as an average runner,
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.860]   I really want that in my watch,
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.380]   so I can leave my phone behind.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.460]   Even better, it's Wi-Fi ready,
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.940]   and not too many people have kind of glommed onto that yet.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.460]   Wi-Fi is not actually supported yet with Android Wear,
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.220]   but obviously it's ready when they do turn it on.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.100]   So I think you'll be able to sync data
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.740]   right over your home Wi-Fi network with this.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.580]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:34.580]   - Yeah, I like this.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:35.420]   - It's gonna be them.
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.820]   - Yeah. - Oh, probably not great.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.820]   Although it doesn't have a trans reflective screen,
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:40.660]   so that helps a little bit.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.700]   - And it is a bigger battery,
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.380]   I think, than the other Moto Wear watches.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.820]   This is a Moto Wear watch.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.980]   It also has a fast processor quad-core A7,
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.180]   Cortex A7.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.140]   Huh, very interesting.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.060]   Same price, 250 is the Moto X.
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.700]   - Yeah.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.900]   - Smartwatch three, it's on the Google Play Store,
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:04.420]   and the device is, I actually really love my Moto 360.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.260]   I really like it.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.380]   - It wants to come back in the country.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.420]   It gets too confused.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.260]   It's now one, Rod time.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.460]   - Well, it should get that from your phone.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:19.140]   - I'm turning it off and back on again, then it re-syncs.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.540]   - Yeah, but he's getting the time on his phone
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:21.700]   from AT&T, remember.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.740]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:26.180]   You actually are on Prague time.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.780]   - Yeah, that's a response time.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.620]   - That's terrible.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.740]   All right, let us get to our tips of the week,
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:35.500]   and we'll let Kevin start things off,
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.900]   just actually just did with the watch,
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.100]   but you got another--
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.020]   - Sure, I'm always good for another one.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.580]   Actually, I think Jeff will appreciate this.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:44.140]   He and I both use a Chromebook Pixel,
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:47.100]   and a lot of people actually use Chromebooks, as we know.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.820]   Talking about Google Drive for iOS,
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.980]   or minding me about this,
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:53.860]   you actually can stream audio and video directly
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:57.020]   from Google Drive using a Chromebook and a Chromecast.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.860]   You just go right into your Files app in the Chromecast.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.700]   Obviously, Google Drive files are there
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.580]   because that's how the file system works in a Chromebook.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.860]   If you got a Chromecast, just cast that video
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.940]   from the player right in your Chromebook,
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.180]   all of a sudden it just starts streaming from the cloud
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.100]   just like any other streaming service,
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.660]   so you're not locally streaming it
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:15.940]   where you get stutters and lags
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.620]   and need a really strong processor.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.940]   So it was in the developer channel of Chrome OS
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:23.140]   back in September, I bet it's probably in beta
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.820]   and close to Stable soon.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.580]   - Very cool.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.540]   So store video on your Google Drive.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.100]   - Well, I gotta do something with that terabyte
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.460]   I got with the Pixel.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.300]   - No, I'll ask that.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:36.260]   - I throw my Beatles anthology movies up there, whatnot,
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.500]   and I just stream it from the cloud.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.340]   - Left for--
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:41.180]   - Well, you can have your own Spotify.
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.100]   - Yeah, not with Taylor Swift.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:43.940]   - Yeah.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.420]   (laughing)
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.060]   - Gina Trippani, your tip of the week.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.260]   - All right, I just spotted this
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.700]   and I haven't had a chance to try it yet,
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:56.260]   but you can now flip a coin through Google Voice Search.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.900]   The new search is rolling out, I believe now
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.540]   the material design new,
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.660]   refresh to the Google Search app.
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:05.740]   And among other feature updates,
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   they've got one that you can say,
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.140]   okay, Google, flip a coin.
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.020]   - That's awesome, can you flip multi-sided die?
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.900]   Like, okay, Google flip a 20-sided dice?
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.740]   - I don't think so.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.580]   - No, oh.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.180]   - But clearly, clearly that's in the queue.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.420]   That's definitely gonna happen.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.940]   Google's just geeky enough for that.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.460]   So I haven't had a chance to try this.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.380]   I actually don't think I've gotten this update yet,
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.340]   but it looks like it probably works on a lollipop device.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.620]   If you, I don't know if you wanna try it on the--
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:32.100]   - Okay, this is the Nexus 7, doesn't do it.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.500]   So let's try it on lollipop.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.580]   Let's try it on lollipop.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.620]   We're not done yet, my friends.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.820]   Let's see, we're gonna go home.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:42.580]   The new home button, which is round.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.040]   Okay, Google, flip a coin.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.660]   - Don't make a liar out of me, Google.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.460]   (groaning)
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.020]   - No, I didn't--
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.340]   - Well, it might not have the new Google Search update.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.460]   - I guess, yeah, so I think it sounds like this update
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.060]   is rolling out, so I guess it didn't ship with lollipop.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.220]   Darn.
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.060]   - That's a great thing that--
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:03.900]   - You're the work, Gina.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.240]   - Say again?
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.080]   - What's that?
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.140]   - Hold your app, you know what that's--
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.460]   - Hold your app!
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.940]   - Is your hold your app not working?
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.820]   - Well, if you say hold or just search,
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.000]   it's supposed to say hold or back,
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   but I can't get it to do that.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.840]   - Well, let's try it.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.680]   - Hold on!
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.040]   - No.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:22.880]   - No.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.720]   - No.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.560]   - There's also the--
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.400]   - There's also the--
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.360]   - Tells you what's gonna do over there, we'll do it.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.840]   - I've heard of a hold or a keyboard,
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.720]   and that's all it'll type.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.280]   - Yeah, yeah, I love it.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.520]   If a new Google, starting November 12th,
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.960]   that's today, you could say hold or into the app.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.200]   The Google app--
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.680]   - I thought it was a search.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.600]   - Oh, you know, this is iOS people use an app.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.040]   It's just for iOS.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.240]   The app goes live at 1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   You can even program the app to set an alarm
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.080]   to remind you it's time to hold or--
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.280]   - Wow, so do we--
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.880]   So anybody got an iPhone?
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.400]   Anybody?
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.040]   - I thought you'd switch back to the iPhone,
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.080]   Leo, you were like that?
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.920]   - You did not switch back to the iPhone, what are you nuts?
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.000]   I'm probably droid-turboing,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.320]   although I like the Note 4,
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.000]   and I don't know maybe the Nexus 6,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.040]   it's between those three.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.760]   - What's the longest you've been loyal to?
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.200]   - I used the Moto X for the original Moto X,
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.760]   probably for eight months or something, almost.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.600]   - Wow.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.320]   - Yeah, I love that phone.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.400]   - Mm-hmm, no, I'm not even here.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.720]   - It's a great phone.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.760]   - You know, just to tag onto what you were talking about,
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.280]   Regina, with the update to search,
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.880]   they're also adding in the ability for you to use,
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.560]   okay, Google to search into other apps now.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.440]   - Yeah, that's cool, I think we talked about that last week.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.680]   - Oh, okay, well that's part of this update.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.800]   So this update also brings that game party.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.640]   - Oh, very nice.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.520]   - And I wonder if any of which apps are using it,
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.360]   they used as an example, Tripit,
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.200]   if you did a, okay, Google, within Tripit.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.520]   - And a million phones went, "Who do?"
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.920]   - Oh, that goes my phone.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.760]   And my watch.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.080]   - Yeah. - I'm a micrombo.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.960]   - Apparently, I just have a voice, Google likes.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:09.080]   - It's actually easy for developers to add that it's like
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.240]   three or four lines Google said when they announced that.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240]   - That's so cool.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.240]   - Yeah.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.480]   - I hope a lot of apps do it.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.080]   Let's see, Jeff, you're still doing them.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.720]   - Well, it's not a fake number, it's either a 199 or 99
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.240]   to probably pay, I wanna know that everybody else
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.200]   gonna order an echo.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.960]   - Did you order an echo?
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.920]   - I put in for the, to be invited to do so.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.840]   - I said it was, it was putting,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.000]   I'm so jet-lagged right now, I can't think.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.040]   Siri in a Prigles can.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040]   - It's true.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.400]   - Can we have an echo on the show if you get one?
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.440]   - Yeah, sure, if I get one, if I get one, if I get invited.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.160]   - Let me, we have the, just so for people who haven't seen it,
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.400]   we have the--
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.320]   - Yeah, that's bizarre.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.640]   - Let me see if I can find it here, don't show it yet.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.720]   Here we go, the early beta.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.560]   - It is.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.200]   - It seems better sitcoms that got canceled.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.040]   - You little family.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:00.880]   - Yeah, little family.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.600]   - Well, what does it do?
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.760]   - Alexa, what do you do?
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.320]   - I'm a talking cylinder.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.360]   I exist only for companionship and utility.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.440]   My existence is utterly meaningless.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.840]   - Awesome.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.000]   Alexa, play rock music.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:16.920]   - Rock music.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   - Alexa, stop.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.560]   - Wait, I wanna try.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.360]   - Alexa, what time is it?
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.440]   - It's time for you to calm.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.280]   - (buzzer)
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.200]   - You actually don't have to yell at it.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200]   Okay, it uses far-field technology,
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.480]   so it can hear you from anywhere in the room.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.320]   - Echo is pretty neat.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.960]   - This dad is such a jerk.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.580]   - It's a
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.240]   - All you have to do is ask.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.520]   - Alexa, how tall is Mount Everest?
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.040]   - Mount Everest is like probably the biggest mountain.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.120]   I heard a guy died trying to climb it.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.640]   - Plus, Echo's really gonna keep
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.840]   him trapped in things like shopping and to-do lists.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.680]   - And paper, Alexa, add wrapping paper to the shopping list.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.840]   - I've added wrap albums to your shopping list.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.680]   - Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.720]   - How is it possible a woman your age doesn't know that?
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.080]   Look it up, you insufferable imbeciles.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:04.920]   - Okay.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:05.760]   - That's not a morning person,
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.680]   but Echo's definitely helps him wake up.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.440]   - Alexa, alarm off.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.480]   - You gotta get up.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.640]   - Oh, Saturday.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.560]   - Alexa, what day is it?
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.680]   - Today's the day Ron gets off his ass
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.520]   and makes something out of his life.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.440]   (laughing)
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.960]   - I would buy it if it was this way.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.200]   - This is the parody obviously of what they did though,
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.520]   which is so great is they took the actual horribly
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.720]   insufferable Amazon video.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.640]   I mean, poor dad, he's such an idiot.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.280]   - He's such an idiot.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.240]   - And they, all they changed,
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.360]   the only thing they changed was Alexa's responses
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.340]   to make them more appropriate.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.200]   But Jeff, don't you already have this capability
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.040]   in your phone?
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.480]   - No, I probably won't actually order it.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.800]   I put it in so I can get them by now if we talk about it.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.000]   Can you imagine?
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.280]   Yeah, I have my phone.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.760]   I don't, I guess there's an argument that says
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.480]   that if it's just there and on all the time
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.800]   and you can start having a conversation
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.200]   with a computer at Star Trek time.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.040]   Computer?
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:14.160]   - Although I have to confess, I spent $600 on the G-Bo.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.280]   (laughing)
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.120]   What the heck?
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.040]   And I'm not gonna get that for a year.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.360]   So it's the same thing.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.200]   You haven't seen this?
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.480]   This is-- - No.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.320]   This is your toothpick.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.160]   - Oh, here.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.000]   - Here.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.920]   - But these are the things that matter.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.920]   And somewhere in between--
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:30.880]   - This is a-- - Is this guy?
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.920]   - Family-- - Introducing--
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.840]   - Robot. - Robot.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.280]   - The world's first family robot.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.600]   Say hi, G-Bo.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.080]   - Hi, G-Bo.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.560]   - They were totally scooped.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.120]   I'm sorry to say by Amazon.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.600]   - Throughout their day.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.440]   - He's the world's best friend.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.400]   - Cynthia Brazil, who is a real robotics expert
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.240]   has done amazing things with robots.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.880]   He's the person behind this.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.320]   They've raised several million, I think.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.360]   They've sold quite a few of these.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.480]   I was one of them, 600 bucks.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.520]   - He's a hands-free helper.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.680]   You can talk to him.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.280]   - And does have a head that turns.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.840]   - So you don't have to skip a beat.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.680]   - Excuse me. - It's definitely
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.520]   cuter than Echo.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520]   - Yeah. - He's G-Bo.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.360]   - Yeah? - And he's--
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.760]   - Just sent a reminder that she's picking you up
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.320]   in half an hour to go--
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.040]   - Cynthia's really good at creating friendly robots.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.840]   I remember seeing her at food camp
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.960]   with one of her robots playing with a kid.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.880]   And the kid just loved the robot.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.440]   Little kid, like four-year-old.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.160]   - And I'll blow your house in.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.120]   - So I'll tell you what, Jeff, you get the Amazon cylinder.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.040]   - Hey, where'd you go?
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.760]   - And then I'll have G-Bo, and we could have a show show with him.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.360]   - I was gonna say this would be a good panel.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.160]   (laughing)
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.240]   - I'm gonna play ourselves off, but the ones.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.240]   (laughing)
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.560]   - They raised $2.2 million, 5,554 supporters.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.360]   But they say it'll be probably next,
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.720]   like a year from now before it comes out.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.160]   - What was the little thing with the,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.160]   had the soft cushion?
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.360]   - Oh, the dat, what was it?
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.920]   - Chubby. - Chubby.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.760]   - Chubby. - Chubby.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.600]   - Yeah.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.080]   - Yeah, it's all-- - I had a chubby too.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.400]   I'm an idiot.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   - I have chubby.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.160]   - I'm an idiot.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.360]   By all this stuff.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.680]   - Chubby, wow. - Just you.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.000]   - While we're on me for just one more second.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.440]   I saw I was in Prague, and I did my favorite Auto Awesome ever.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.440]   It's on the rundown.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.120]   Oh, I wanna see it.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:21.960]   By the way, the only,
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.880]   there is something that's interesting about this Amazon thing
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.120]   is that somehow Amazon, in a skunkworks project,
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.360]   must have been going on for years,
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.480]   created voice recognition Amazon style.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.120]   I mean, that's something that Google took a long time to do.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.920]   Apple took a long time to do, Microsoft.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.840]   I mean, this is really cool.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.800]   What is this head?
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.920]   - Oh, neat, Jeff.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.200]   - That's a sculpture in Prague,
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.160]   and I just, it was made for Auto Awesome,
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.360]   that was all, it was made for.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.200]   So it's always moving.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.560]   - Yeah.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.480]   - So move with the wind or is it mechanized?
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.360]   - I don't know what's mechanized,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.400]   the face goes around.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.480]   I just took one.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.440]   - Prague is cool.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.280]   - It is cool.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.620]   - Yeah.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.580]   - I'm jealous.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.920]   All right, well, I don't have a tool,
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.540]   so I think we can wrap this puppy up and put a bow on it.
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:12.560]   Thank you very much for being here, Kevin Tofel,
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.040]   the mobile editor for Gigagon.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040]   - Great job for Kevin.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.800]   - And one of the few people in the world
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.440]   who's had Nexus 6 for.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.240]   - You weren't too obnoxious about it either, Kevin.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.440]   I was trying to keep it down.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.320]   - His review is on Gigagon.
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.840]   You wanna, I mean, in summary,
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.680]   I think you kind of did summarize it.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:36.400]   - Sure, I mean, you know, it's, again,
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.200]   got the same guts as some of the more current Android phones
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.000]   that are out there, as we said earlier on the show.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.280]   There's so many great phones to choose from.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:46.120]   If you have to have a large top notch Android phone,
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.480]   this is definitely one to consider.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.280]   You won't have to wait for the Lollipop Android as well.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.640]   Lollipop upgrade as well.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.360]   So yeah, I mean, it's a nice phone.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.880]   - It looks like Lollipop's gonna get to a number
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:00.080]   of the Moto phones before the Nexus 6 gets to the stores.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.800]   Team Mobile was supposed to have it today,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.320]   and they've announced it's gonna be--
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.160]   - It pushed back?
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.000]   - Yeah, they pushed it back.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.080]   And I think that's because there aren't any of them.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.880]   - Kevin, what scared me from what you said in your review
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.840]   was that might also be better off with the battery life,
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.360]   that's what the other phones?
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.840]   - Well, when you're pushing all these pixels
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.320]   on a larger display, even though it's an AMOLED screen,
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.000]   which is energy efficient and such,
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.560]   you know, you're gonna pay the price and battery life.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.960]   We still haven't solved that problem.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.400]   That's what we need for the next big thing in phones
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.280]   is batteries that last for days, right?
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.120]   - I agree.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.280]   - All right, so if the prices were equal,
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.480]   one plus one versus Nexus 6.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.440]   - If the prices were equal,
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.640]   I probably would go with the 6, I think.
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.440]   - Yeah, I think the one plus one is because it's so inexpensive
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440]   is what makes it so interesting.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.880]   - Right, and what you're getting for the price there
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.720]   is tremendous-- - Public phone,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.040]   not a cheaply made phone.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.760]   - No, it's a great phone for 300 bucks.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:59.760]   6 inches is big too.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.080]   Have you ever had a 6 inch phone?
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.280]   - I returned to Nexus 4, I mean, I have no 3 at one point.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.040]   - Okay, even that wasn't 6, that was 5, 2 or 5, 5.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.480]   The, I mean, I have a Nokia 1520,
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.800]   which is the only 6 inch phone I've tried.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.200]   And I like it, but--
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.960]   - Well, you'd like the notes, I like it.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   - Yeah, and I've always been, I've had every note.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.040]   Hey, I note that you say in your review
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.800]   that instead of Dalvik, the Nexus 6 is using art,
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.880]   the art runtime.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.420]   Is that true for all Lollipop devices now?
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:38.520]   - I believe yes, it was experimental in Android 4.3,
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.080]   perhaps, but it is the default runtime in Lollipop.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.840]   So maybe, and that could be attributable
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.320]   to some of the bugs that I've seen.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.960]   And I'm not the only one who saw those.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:51.080]   I've read the other reviews right before the show.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:54.040]   And a lot of people saw the same little buggy things
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.240]   like I did, so maybe there's some runtime compatibility
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.560]   things that need to be resolved, so.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.640]   - Okay, that's interesting.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.680]   I wanna see if I can, huh.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.680]   Yeah, I've had problems with compatibility with art
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.320]   with just a handful of programs.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320]   But that's-
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.400]   - That'll change over time though.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.960]   - Yeah, especially if Lollipop uses art.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:16.800]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.640]   - Interesting.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.600]   All right, thank you very much for that.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.560]   We're really glad to get a review on here.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.800]   That's, and the camera, you know what?
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.440]   That looks pretty, that is a good looking cat.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.920]   - That is a lazy cat that's been sitting here
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.480]   listening for the dolphins next to me, this whole show.
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.880]   - What a great picture.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.400]   And I mean, the detail on the fur, that looks good.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.200]   There's plenty of light, obviously, but that's still-
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.040]   - That's the key, that's the key.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.880]   - That's my new 4K monitor looking at a 4K video.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:45.760]   - Sweet.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.600]   How big is it?
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.440]   - More.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.600]   - 28 inches.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.320]   - Ooh, how much does it cost?
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.320]   - Amazon refurbed, $459.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.160]   - Ooh.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.000]   - That's great.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.400]   - Yeah, that's the one Samsung was making a lot of hay on.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.240]   - Yep.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.760]   All right, now I don't know what to do,
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.960]   but fortunately, I get to own them all.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.880]   It's a good thing.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.800]   - Yeah, it's the nice thing.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.200]   I could try them all, and then I have to decide
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.880]   which one, don't carry.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.720]   - Thank you, Kevin.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.080]   Great to have you, gigaohm.com.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.440]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, for sitting, suffering through
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.560]   sleep deprivation for us today.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.080]   - Or suffering through me, thank you.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   - Yeah.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.140]   No, you're great, you're always great.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:29.280]   I'm just, I know how hard that is to do what you just did,
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.120]   so thank you.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.080]   Gina Tarpani's suffering through the flu.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:34.920]   (laughing)
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.680]   - It's not quite the flu, but yeah.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.520]   - Everybody's limping here.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.360]   - Everybody's limping here.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.040]   - I got the Rudolph nose going on.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:40.880]   - Yeah, a lot of fun.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.700]   Thanks for having me.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.540]   We're quite a crew today.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:46.120]   We had sickness, sleep deprivation, whole thing.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.560]   - Yeah, thank you for being here.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.560]   - This is lots of fun as usual.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.240]   - Thinkup.com, you gotta go there.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.880]   You can get your free trial of ThinkUp,
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.400]   which is a great insight engine
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.880]   into your social media, Twitter and Facebook,
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.520]   and I use it all the time.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.800]   I'm getting ThinkUp notifications now, which is really fun.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.160]   - Oh, good, I'm glad.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.000]   - Yeah, it's fun to see those.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   - That's good to know that.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.040]   Did you know that iTunes Podcast can thank me
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.600]   for 184,000 more people seeing its tweet?
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.440]   Huh, huh?
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.080]   - Is that an official Apple account?
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.720]   You've got one for you.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.560]   - Yeah.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.240]   No wonder they keep asking me to retweet them.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.560]   I used exclamation points in 11 tweets
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.480]   this past month, exclamation point.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.720]   That's 31% of my tweet's exclamation point.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.440]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.760]   That's really, really bad.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.600]   - That is an LA.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.600]   - Yeah.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.960]   - You're not a 12 year old girl.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.680]   You have to go back to journalism school.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:40.680]   - Hey, nothing wrong with 12 year old girls.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.240]   (laughing)
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.600]   - And I think I am a 12 year old girl, so.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.000]   My best time for responses between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.560]   - How many aspects was do you have Leo?
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.400]   - 11 in--
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.000]   - Actually, you only have what, so we normally,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.280]   if you use double or triple, we chart it
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.200]   and you didn't have a chart,
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.640]   that means you were pretty restrained,
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.280]   but only using the exclamation points.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.520]   - Yeah, I know two double.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.680]   - I had 39.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.200]   - Professor of journalism, Jeff Jarvis,
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.720]   like Chisholmation Point, apparently.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.040]   - Who's the enthusiastic tween now?
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.140]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.280]   - Choo-chay.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.120]   Choo-chay.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.800]   (laughing)
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.640]   - This is fun.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.680]   This is really, anyway, if you haven't got your--
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.320]   - George's okay, change his profile.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.520]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.160]   Oh, my.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.000]   - My.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.320]   - My.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.600]   (laughing)
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.360]   - Oh, my.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.840]   This is fun.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.280]   All your best tweets.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.640]   All the information.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.240]   This is good.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.320]   Thank you so much, Gina.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.160]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.000]   - Thank you.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:47.840]   - Thank you, Kevin.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.680]   Thank you all for being here.
