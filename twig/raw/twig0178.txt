[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.120]   This is Twig, this week in Google, Episode 178,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.280]   recorded the day after Christmas 2012, the best of 2012.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.680]   This week in Google is brought to you
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120]   by Ford featuring Bliss, the blind spot information system,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.440]   with cross traffic alert and active park assist.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.880]   Check out these available features

[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.080]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to a special edition of This Week
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.520]   in Google.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.080]   You'll notice Jeff's not here.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.720]   Gina's with her family.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   It is after all the Christmas week.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   So we thought it'd be fun to do with Twig, what we've done
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.400]   with other shows in the past, and do a year
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.320]   and or best of some of the best segments from this year's
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.800]   this week in Google.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000]   We've got some good stuff for you coming up.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600]   Let's start with the fun that we all
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320]   had thinking about all the things we didn't get.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   And some of us did get at Google I/O early in the year.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.400]   I'll tell you what, I plus won.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.640]   Wow.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.880]   So Vic Conductor is talking on, a little bit of little droning
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   on about events.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.560]   This is a new feature in Google Plus.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   And all of a sudden, Sergey Brin, one of the fanners
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.520]   at Google, says, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.720]   I'm going to let you talk in a minute.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   But first, Beyonce-- no, no, it wasn't that.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.720]   It was--
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.360]   But first, this is a time critical demo.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.240]   Yeah, that was great.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.080]   I mean, you ran on stage breathless,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.920]   wearing the Google glasses, and just like, hey,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.960]   I hate to interrupt you.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   But just got something going on that's a little time sensitive.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.000]   And up on the screen, you see an air balloon
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   or a Zeppelin kind of hanging.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.440]   And we're like, my first thought was, oh, it's
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.400]   a Google Maps flyover.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.200]   They're doing something crazy.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.760]   It looks like that 3D thing, yeah.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.040]   But it was actually--
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   Skydiving, wearing Google Glass, Project Glass.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.200]   It was amazing.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   Now, some people were saying, well, that
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.520]   must have been scripted, right?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.400]   I don't think so.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.640]   I think that the Hindenburg or whatever was called the Zeppelin--
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.320]   it's probably not the right name.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.000]   The Zeppelin was right over the Moscone Center,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.360]   and it had to be when it was there, right?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.160]   I don't know.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   They can steer it a bit.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   They're not one by the wind.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.800]   It's not like a high eblen.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.600]   Yeah, well, maybe.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.640]   But why do you think it was so critical?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   Then that they do this at the exact time?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.920]   Oh, they do it the exact time.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.320]   I mean, yeah, maybe they had to have
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.880]   gotten some sort of airspace regulatory kind of permission
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   for these guys to drop onto the--
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.440]   So that's the other thing.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.680]   Do they have to put permission to do this?
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   They had to-- so the four Skydivers in a plane wearing
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.640]   Google Glasses jump out of the plane
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.880]   and land on the roof of Moscone.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.320]   Which was--
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.240]   While doing a hangout, by the way, there's five divers.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.240]   Yeah, you can see them on the phone.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.560]   And they're in a hangout.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   This was one of the most incredible live demos.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.360]   Gutsiest-- gutsiest.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.320]   I mean, just the ambitions.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.000]   Well, yes, Sir G said, this might go all--
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.440]   here's the interrupt.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   You can take it from my screen.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.200]   If you can see my screen, can you see my screen?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.700]   All right.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   Let me go back a little bit.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.960]   Here we go.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.480]   Sir Gage.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.440]   I like all the event for you.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.480]   So Sir G-Bren wonders that in the middle of Vic's speech.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.280]   Guys, we--
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.800]   And he's not seen in public without the last--
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.360]   He's doing something pretty magical here.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.860]   He's right.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.480]   And we have a special surprise for you.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.200]   We've got something pretty special for you.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.400]   It's a little bit time sensitive,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.680]   so I apologize for interrupting.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.200]   The good news is that Vic is very poised
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.360]   and he can handle this kind of thing.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200]   I don't know.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.800]   There's a lot of presenters who would have been completely
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.960]   thrown by this.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.540]   It was actually really neat to see the difference
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.600]   between the two of them.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.080]   I'm going to have 500 different ways.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.280]   Who wants to see a demo of Glass?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.080]   One of the reasons I like Google's keynotes, they're very real.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   They know they're talking to developers.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.800]   They're real.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.360]   They're genuine.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080]   And the developers, I think, appreciate that.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.640]   They don't want to be marketed to as much.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.080]   Yep.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   So they had these guys up in this Zeppelin.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   I'm told it's a Zeppelin because it's a rigid frame, not a blimp.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.240]   Well, we can see that on screen,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.600]   but they actually jumped out of a plane.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.120]   I think the Zeppelin must have just been there.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.920]   No, no, no, Zeppelin.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.520]   Oh, they--
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   That was--
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.720]   Because I thought you could see the wing when they were coming out.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.000]   No, no.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.520]   I think they jumped out of the Zeppelin.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   Because it's the gondola.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   Because they were hovering.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.000]   OK.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   See, the wing is probably that little fin there.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.600]   So they have a couple of guys.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.200]   Right, you're right.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   You're right.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.680]   We just saw the shot up.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.520]   In the Zeppelin.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280]   And they had a hangout.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.400]   And they have squirrel suits.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.280]   They have those flight suits.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.320]   I know, those flights, those are so cool.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.440]   Yeah, those are so cool.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520]   They must have been able to steer that way a little bit.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.320]   He said that.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.920]   He said, we can steer a little bit.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.560]   We've got to be over the top.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.000]   They did a perfect landing on the roof.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.280]   And then they biked and repelled and ran into--
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.680]   Here, I've got it on my screen here, if you want to watch it.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.880]   Which is great for their landing.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.200]   I lent you down here.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.480]   And I thought maybe you guys could show us a fun time
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.920]   on the way down.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.840]   And you skipped full a bit.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.120]   Because they took a while to actually jump.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120]   It looks like a long way down.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.320]   But yes, so somebody in the chat room was saying,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.120]   the quality looked good for it to the glasses.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.200]   But they had someone with a camera on as well.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.880]   You could see that they were cutting back and forth.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.640]   When they cut, they cut to a much better quality picture.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.960]   So the glasses do not have 3G or their Wi-Fi only right now.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.760]   And so this is clearly not Wi-Fi.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.480]   I would guess that they were glasses were connected to a pack
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.120]   that had 3 or 4G built into it.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.440]   Here he is.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   They had to.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   Coming down.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.400]   We speculated that it was maybe a live view, which we've used.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.640]   They have a small-- they have a very small unit it could have been.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.440]   There's other companies making something similar.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.480]   I thought I saw some wires coming up the back of the ear
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480]   that went down to a battery box.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.040]   It's a very good image, though.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.880]   And this is from the glasses.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.040]   And then they got the ground they cut to.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.240]   Then they have to see it.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.520]   That's a camera guy.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.920]   And you can actually see the camera operators running around a little bit.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.360]   These are the people landing.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.920]   At this point, Moscone, the whole hall was just like--
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.440]   It was-- everyone was losing it.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.920]   But it was this like 10 silence.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.200]   I mean, it was just-- it was ran.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.560]   The energy is just ranked up.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.240]   Yeah, they didn't.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.520]   Well, it was clear.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.000]   Sorry, it was clear that he was not sure that this was going to work.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.680]   And he was amped and kind of breathless and excited.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.800]   Which is why you should do stuff like this.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Takes some chances.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   Absolutely.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.160]   And they hand off the glasses to some acrobatic bicyclists on the roof,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.400]   who actually took my breath away because they ride to the edge of the roof--
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.920]   Yes.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   --to a ramp.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   This was crazy, too.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.600]   I jumped on the next building.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   And they jumped to the next building.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.360]   And you could tell the audience is kind of going, what?
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.840]   At this point, we were all just like, holy cow.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.560]   This is the best there's never been.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.800]   And now they're handing off the glasses.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   Now, it's funny because as it turned out, this was a non-working prototype.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.160]   Sergey pulled it out of the pouch and nothing happened.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.600]   It was like, you think this is it.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   But that's not the point.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.640]   Nobody's paying any attention.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.040]   So now this guy's going to repel down the side of Moscone Center.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.880]   How did they get permission to do this?
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.240]   How did they rehearse this?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.040]   I mean--
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.440]   Look at this.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.600]   I mean, they rehearsed it at Google.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.120]   I don't know.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.960]   They might have rehearsed it.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.880]   Is they should have a video at the end of them doing it--
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.080]   Yeah, they've done it at Moscone.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.480]   Because it would have stopped traffic.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   And I mean, look at that angle.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720]   This guy running down the side of the--
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   So he's telling the guy, oh, no, we're not on the first floor.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   He ran all the way to the bus.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.960]   Then he gets on a bike on the balcony.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.120]   He rides on a bike.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   And the most people I've ever--
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.760]   They aren't going slowly into the hall either.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.840]   It's pretty clear that--
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.280]   So this is not the glasses.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.600]   This is-- that's the glass.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.680]   This is another stuff like right there.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   That goes through.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.440]   A lot of hands.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.520]   This is going to go as an--
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.320]   akin to the Olympic torch being heavy.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.160]   I know.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.960]   And look, and they're riding through outside.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.280]   I'm amazed nobody got clipped, to be honest.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.520]   This is kind of like me running up
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.920]   full street on the way to the things.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.800]   And into the hall where you guys are.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.280]   That must have been very exciting.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.840]   It was exciting.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.480]   It was exciting.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.000]   It was exciting.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.840]   It was the showmanship.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.960]   You know, I have a press pass.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.040]   I'm sitting in the press section.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.760]   I'm trying to kind of keep my applause.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.560]   You know, I'm trying to be cool, right?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.960]   It was difficult, though, not to applaud for these people.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   Pro tip.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.240]   Or if not, the corporate tactics.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.320]   And the movie human effort.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.800]   It's OK to applaud this.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.080]   Yeah, you got to applaud these people.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.680]   This is not a product.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.040]   I mean, they just-- yeah.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.160]   These are amazing.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   It was an athletic feat.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.320]   And then this like, you know, crowd of glass wearing athletes
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.760]   kind of like strutted in all badass,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.440]   and everyone was taking pictures, and their lights.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.080]   It was crazy.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.640]   How long before they do the slow motion walk video of this?
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.880]   Because watch as they come in the hall.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.360]   They look very stubborn.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.880]   Yeah, they do.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.320]   They look very stubborn.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.800]   They wear in the glasses.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.440]   They're very right stuff.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.400]   Yeah, it's like, oh, right.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.880]   That's pointing to the--
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   Sergey handled this, I think, pretty well, too.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   He made it a little more exciting by being somewhat uncertain.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, he was uncertain.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.920]   He was excited.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.200]   He was-- I mean, he's a--
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.320]   I don't believe this is going to work.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.280]   He's a pilot, right?
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.920]   He's really into flying.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.320]   So not that I've ever met a pilot that was ever
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   in support of Skydiving.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.400]   Why would you ever jump on the corporate plane?
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.280]   We need the slow motion.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.520]   Yeah, but check this out.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   This is-- yeah.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.360]   Phone rights stuff, isn't it?
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.520]   Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.840]   Yeah, people were going nuts.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.880]   It was pretty jaw dropping.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.240]   That's a good demo.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.960]   Yeah, it was a really good demo.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   It really was.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.960]   Oh, man.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.240]   All right.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   Absent that, we actually learned nothing.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.320]   We learned that you can take pictures.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.480]   But we knew you can take pictures.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   But believe it.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.520]   Pictures for months.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.480]   You can take pictures.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.680]   It's like from your point of view.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.360]   From your point of view.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.680]   Did they mention that you can also take pictures?
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.040]   Because you could just take pictures.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.960]   With your-- from your--
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.400]   Look, here's a baby.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.320]   And that picture is being taken by the mother.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.920]   So, OK.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.880]   So what do you do?
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.280]   How do you take pictures?
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.080]   What do you do?
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.360]   Well, right, I know.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.120]   Do you press a button?
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.920]   Are you shrugging?
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.440]   Are you?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.240]   They said that it is just your wear.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.320]   So you can go like this.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.040]   You could blink.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.540]   I don't know.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.920]   They said it's paying attention.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.960]   It's pushing your gaze.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.200]   There was a picture of a runner--
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's getting these.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.360]   See, a lot of the pictures from your point of view
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.960]   aren't actually that interesting.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.920]   But I have to say that the baby video--
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.760]   I was cute.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.240]   So the skydiving thing was great and exciting.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.360]   But not all of us are going to be skydiving, repelling,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.680]   and jumping across buildings every day.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.200]   But looking at your newborn, who won't give you--
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.600]   give a big, bold camera a smile.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.480]   I mean, that was pretty powerful.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.840]   That's true.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.120]   And the newborn looks back into your eyes.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.000]   Yeah, and smiles because you see his mom.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.480]   Yeah, that's pretty powerful stuff.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.960]   Now, I thought this might get the biggest roar from the crowd
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.640]   at the very end.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.320]   And we're jumping ahead a little bit.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.880]   Vic comes back on stage and says, oh, and by the way,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.560]   we're going to let those of you here buy these.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.920]   Did you get excited?
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   I was pretty excited.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.640]   I want to put those glasses on.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.480]   I was less excited when I heard $15, $100.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.840]   When you heard the price, I was like, we're buying it.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.680]   And then $1,500, it was like--
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.400]   And he said it's not going to work very well.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.520]   Right, not going to work very well.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.760]   We only want people who really care enough about this,
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.200]   or as you said in the car up here,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.520]   or who are really rich to try them.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.640]   I don't even want to buy.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.120]   And then I'm thinking, can I expense that?
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.320]   And then it's next year.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.600]   Right, and then it ships next year.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.520]   So you order today, you can only order Ad I/O,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.160]   and then it ships early.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.800]   So I have a text from Jason Howell of all about Android and TNT.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.560]   He's there right now.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.800]   He says, should I get the glasses?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.440]   Should you take a vote?
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.920]   I think that what he meant to ask was,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.600]   can I use the credit card?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.840]   He says, exactly.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.200]   He says, you want me to sign up for Project Glass?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.960]   You could have mine if you want.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.200]   Yeah, with my money.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.480]   Should I say yes?
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.000]   Everybody in the chat room says yes.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.840]   I think I think you could--
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.520]   Yes.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   Do they keep your money?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.920]   No, they probably don't bill you until later.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.200]   But my favorite tweet of the entire morning was--
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Order 1 pair.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.160]   Tom tweeted, I lean in all caps.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.960]   Order the glasses.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.560]   Exclamation point.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.360]   And then they told us the price.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.000]   And as I remember, Tom said, stop it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.160]   But yeah, it reminds me of way back
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.480]   when I used to do video game development.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.520]   And they bring out a new console.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.840]   And you had to pay for development machines.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.920]   Prototypes are expensive and one of things.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.400]   Sure.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.320]   This is not an early manufacturing run.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.200]   This is like, we've got a bunch of these that--
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.320]   the ones they're wearing, they probably will handmade.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.680]   This batch will be an early manufacturing run.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   And it'll be flaky.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.120]   And they want to make sure that--
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.040]   I think it's deliberately to deter.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.960]   They've probably set that price deliberately to deter people
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.600]   from going, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.160]   So like, oh, well, that's like a whole new laptop.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   Delta 9 is pointing out that I could probably sell it
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.480]   for $3,000.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.920]   Yeah, I mean, that was right.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.120]   Right.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.960]   Could make a little money on the side there.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.360]   I'm going to try to use that argument with my wife.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.280]   When we're done, we'll sell it on eBay.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.160]   Yeah, we'll make a profit, honey, really.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.960]   It's cool.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.680]   Probably will, actually.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.000]   I look like a complete dork.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.960]   But really, we'll make some money from it.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.280]   I know about a track of it all.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.560]   OK, but you cannot wear these outside.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.520]   You can't wear these without--
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.000]   Right.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   Anywhere where we're supposed to look nice.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.560]   Right.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.760]   That's like that's something.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.200]   People trying on Sergey's glasses.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.320]   So this is the only thing.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.200]   I mean, we still don't know even is it Android?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.800]   Does it tie to a phone?
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.720]   Does it-- how do you control it?
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.560]   We don't know anything about it.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.640]   Besides the fact that it takes pictures from your point of view
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   and video.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.640]   Pictures and video.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.280]   That's all we got.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.520]   And it's a decent camera.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.320]   Although--
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:51.960]   Decent.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.920]   You take the sensor out of any Android
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.160]   phone.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.000]   And it's not that big.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.440]   I mean, I could fit that sensor in all the supporting hardware
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.320]   and a small battery.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.440]   I guess into something that would fit over my ears, right?
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.840]   I believe there are things like this already.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.680]   If all you're talking about is cameras,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.960]   a chat room, isn't there a company that
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   makes something that is basically glasses that you wear
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.720]   that take pictures?
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.800]   They don't-- it doesn't do anything else.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.720]   Right.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   So I don't think that that's particularly innovative.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.000]   We'll have to wait and see.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.520]   Yes.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.280]   The assumption is that it's talking to a phone in your pocket.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.200]   That's my assumption.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.840]   But I don't think they've even said that.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.280]   I think, well, yeah, I think I'm thinking they've shown that.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   But yeah.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.960]   Is it Android in here?
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.240]   Or is it a peripheral--
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.640]   Or is it Android accessibility?
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.040]   If the designer said they wear less than sunglasses,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.480]   the battery isn't in them.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.680]   No, they said the battery's in them.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   They said it.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.160]   I remember reading that the battery is in them.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.520]   It's very confusing.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.360]   If the battery's not in it, then you're
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.320]   having a wire leading from your glasses to your pocket.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.240]   Tell me that.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.720]   It had wires on-- look.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.520]   OK.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.040]   Anyway, there's--
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.800]   I don't know.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.960]   I hope not.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.400]   This is Sergei with a thing plugged into a wire going
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.880]   to the glasses, and Liz Gans is wearing this.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.560]   That's the pickup so that you can see the output.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.400]   You know what let's call Liz?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.960]   Liz, what's going on with that?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.400]   All right.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.280]   There's more to talk about.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.480]   This was a long keynote.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.920]   We've now kind of shown you the really most exciting thing,
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.280]   right?
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.080]   Yeah, well--
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.720]   That was fun.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.840]   Two other devices we haven't talked about yet.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   I'm waiting them.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.960]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.080]   Also, Google Play has encryption now.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   Would you-- OK, developer explained to me why the developers--
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.040]   does that mean they have for security?
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.160]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.800]   And it's not any piracy.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.400]   I mean--
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.320]   It was-- they said it was-- it was signed for that one.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.640]   So that basically, you could only decrypt it
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.120]   on that device that bought it.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   Right.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   The device ID is actually--
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.080]   DRM.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.160]   Yes.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.840]   That was whether they went every quickly.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.920]   They did go over it quickly, right?
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.360]   But it was a way to embed the device ID into the APK,
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.440]   which is the application package to say,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.600]   you purchased this on this device.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.000]   It's only going to be installed on this device.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.160]   Personally, I don't care about this.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.720]   I turn this off when I upload my app.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.160]   I just--
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.640]   The game was wrong.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.760]   Yeah, it was wrong.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   Right.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.720]   The incremental app updates I really like.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.160]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.040]   That I was excited about.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.080]   So only the parts of the APK, which have changed,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.720]   get downloaded, which is great for everybody.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.480]   Less bandwidth, less installation time.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   It's just great for everybody.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.080]   And I assume they use that smart compressed
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.280]   they develop for Chrome that's really good at compressing code.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.600]   Oh, I had a lot about that.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   But yeah, that makes sense.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.640]   There's a good technical about it.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   But basically, they looked at codes that, oh, right.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.840]   Code is really compressible if you understand code.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.760]   Right.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.200]   And you can compress it by--
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.840]   if you understand what the address offsets are
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   and all the pieces where the jumps are,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.280]   you can actually compress it really easily,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.400]   because then you can move it about.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.120]   If you don't understand that, all the address offsets
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.240]   don't work very well.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.800]   So you have to turn the absolute jumps
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.720]   to relative jumps, stuff like that.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.920]   There's a bunch of kind of stuff that they built for that,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.320]   which is deployed in the Chrome update cycle,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.000]   which how they can do those updates so quickly.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   So I think they move that brains into this as well,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.840]   which would be really good.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.640]   Yeah, it's really nice to see these things converge
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.680]   and to see different technologies kind of benefit one
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   another.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.480]   So Darren Murph writing for Engadget says, here's
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   what we know about Google Glass.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.800]   They were able to talk to people at Google I/O.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.920]   Engineers are experimenting with connectivity options,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.120]   existing prototypes, including those worn in the sky
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   diving stunt do not have 3G or 4G connectivity.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.960]   Although it is possible such a module could end up
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.200]   in production devices.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.400]   The general idea is latching onto nearby Wi-Fi hotspots
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.280]   or relying on a wireless tether with your smartphone.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.720]   So there you go with a smartphone.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.560]   So that was the big squeeze.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.600]   Controlling Glass will rely on a mixture of inputs.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.720]   It'll recognize voice commands while also taking cues
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.080]   from the right sidebar.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.880]   We've seen Sergey do that to swipe his template
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.960]   to do things.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.360]   The touch sensitive pad on there that'll understand gestures.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.560]   It's also probable Glass will be able to be controlled
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.040]   by a via one smartphone.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.680]   But physical inputs would be the preferred ones.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.320]   There's an accelerometer and a gyroscope
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.480]   so you could nod or shake your head.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.560]   The internal batteries, it's just behind the ear
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.040]   on the right side.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.520]   There's the battery.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.200]   Nice.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.720]   Nice.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.520]   Good looking.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.360]   Capacity and longevity not confirmed.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.880]   Glass will be able to record locally.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.040]   But the idea is to have most everything streamed live
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.840]   to the web.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   Great.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.200]   Take them off before you go to the bathroom.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600]   In an area where wireless data is not available,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   the storing video will be possible for uploading later.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.480]   So that's inside stuff that they can confirm.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.440]   Now they mentioned when they were talking about play cloud
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.960]   messaging.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.320]   Now I was really interested in that.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.440]   Is that sending intents through the cloud?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.040]   Would that mean that I could control an app?
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.840]   I mean, they're close because Play will install.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.280]   I can go on the web, say install it,
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.480]   and my phone starts installing.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.040]   That wasn't clear.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.920]   Well, they remember that.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.400]   They said go to the session and they didn't explain it.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.000]   I'm assuming it's an iMessage competitor.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.440]   That was my takeaway.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   They did it really quickly.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.880]   It was C2DM.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880]   When they just said--
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.680]   And it was like, what?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.280]   C2DM, so cloud messaging.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.120]   They just said, free for all developers,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   no quota limitations.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.920]   But I still wasn't clear on what exactly it was.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.880]   I mean, this is the same thing that
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.720]   lets you send up notifications to the device.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   But I think they meant that.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   Right.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.760]   I think they meant individual ones.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.320]   That was-- Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   C2DM.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:14.840]   C2DM.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.360]   So this is a service that helps developers send data
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.800]   from servers to their applications.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.600]   OK, so like push messages from the server?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.000]   So lightweight mechanism servers
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.880]   can use to tell mobile apps to contact the server directly
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.720]   to fetch updated applications.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.960]   Basically, you think your app doesn't
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.760]   have to wake up and poll.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.200]   So it should be good for battery life.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.920]   Instead of polling--
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.440]   Right, polling.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.840]   Instead of polling, push.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.680]   Your server-side app can--
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.120]   C2DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.560]   So I guess it's now replaced by GCM--
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.840]   Google Cloud Messaging Framework.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.360]   Right.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.480]   So this supersedes that.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.000]   Right.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So it's deprecated.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   This is the thing that I was talking about.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   It does the same thing.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.120]   This could be lightweight messaging,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.040]   telling the Android application there's new data to be fetched.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.920]   So hey, I got something for you.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.360]   Or it could be a message containing up
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.880]   to four kilobytes of payload.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.760]   So you could use it for instant messaging.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.600]   Yes.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Or tweeting.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.360]   Or tweeting.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.920]   4K is quite a bit, actually.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.080]   Quite a bit of text.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.160]   You have quite a bit of text.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.080]   Not so much for images.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.920]   It's a very short piece of audio.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.320]   It handles all aspects of queuing of messages
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.160]   and delivery to the target Android app.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.160]   That's cool.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.240]   I don't know if there's an analog in the Apple world,
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.040]   but I think there is.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.200]   I think when they introduce notifications,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.160]   they introduce some lightweight--
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.920]   Right, a little push.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   Push.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   I mean, any app right that was going to update with new content
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.000]   that could benefit from that.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.960]   And then magazines.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.840]   That was the deadliest response in the whole thing.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   And we've got magazines.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.360]   Any pause?
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.000]   Anyone was like, huh.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   OK.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.320]   Magazines.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.160]   Magazines.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.200]   I think you remember those.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.040]   Yeah, the magazines.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   What are those again?
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.720]   You have the identities.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.760]   You print there's something--
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yes.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   Magazines.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.840]   Movies for sale.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.360]   Movies for sale.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.240]   Not just rental TV as well on the Play Store.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.040]   This was all sort of build up to--
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.080]   An X is 7.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.240]   An X is 7.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.480]   So you're both going to get one later today.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.040]   I was hoping that you would push forward in the line
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.640]   and you would say, I want one.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.320]   I'm going up to the brick house.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.080]   I need to bring it for that, but you didn't.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.440]   It is a sea of very elb-y, backpack-laden nerds down there.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.080]   And they said they were going to start at 4 PM.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.120]   So that line at 4--
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.840]   In fact, I'm probably going to wait till tomorrow.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.440]   Right.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.840]   Well, I don't know if I'll be able to wait till tomorrow.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.040]   So I'm going to wait.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.120]   So Tegra 3, it's the first Tegra 3 device.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.440]   That is a very, very fast system on a chip.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.640]   They mentioned quad-core CPU.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.480]   And what did they say?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.120]   16 GPU threads or something?
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.560]   Some huge--
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.240]   Yeah, the spec sounded very nice.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.160]   And they demoed it.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   It looked fantastic.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   It was fantastic.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.720]   Really amazing.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.280]   Real-time 3D stuff, 12-core GPU, gyroscope, accelerometer,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.920]   9 hours amended, by the way, later to 8 hours of video playback.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   Was it amended?
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.200]   And if you go to play.google.com right now,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.000]   it's on the front page.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.200]   I already won.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.120]   It's for sale right now.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.640]   I'm 99.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.400]   I know you did.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   You did.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   You keep yours.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.280]   You keep lying.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   That's yours.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.720]   And I ordered one.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.520]   So this is the Google's Kindle Fire for the Play Store.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.440]   This is not an iPad 10.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.520]   But more responsive, I think, than the Fire.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.080]   Because I think Google looked at the Fire and said, that's crap.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.760]   We can do better.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.200]   And we want people buying stuff from our store.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.840]   How often have YouTube rented movies from the Google Play Store?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.240]   I do it from Apple all the time, every day, almost.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.160]   From Apple.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.280]   From the Apple Store.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:27.480]   Right.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.080]   But how many times have you rented something from the Play Store?
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.120]   If it is the Play Store, use the Amazon one.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.000]   I use Amazon.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.520]   Quite a bit.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.320]   I use the free ones on Amazon quite a lot.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.160]   Because I've got Prime.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.680]   Why not use Play?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.960]   Because you'd have to watch it on your phone.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.240]   We're going to get to the solution to that in a second.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.840]   $199, that is a shocking price.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.960]   That's the only one right at Amazon available next month.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.680]   $250, $249, for 16 gigs.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.320]   Target's straight at fire.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.840]   And obviously, unless you feel like the connection to Amazon
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.880]   is important for you, it's going to be a fire killer, I
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.520]   would say.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:04.920]   I would agree.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.520]   I mean, it has all the Google productivity apps built in
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.080]   as well, right?
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.040]   So the Fire is very much a media consumption device, an e-reader
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.600]   watching.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.920]   But with this, you get Google Calendar, you get Gmail,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.520]   you get all the Google goodness maps, you get all that.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   And--
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.760]   Right.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.480]   The Kindle Fire is a not with Google Android.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.160]   It's an open source Android, which
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.640]   means that they don't get all those pieces that you get
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.960]   by signing a deal with Google.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.160]   So they were making a thing about that.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   You get the full set.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.920]   You get the full set.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.600]   Yep.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.160]   And it will be ice cream sandwich.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.640]   Yes?
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.320]   Yes.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.320]   Oh, no.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:35.880]   For Jelly Bean.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.480]   For one, Jelly Bean.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.160]   And presumably, the Kindle app will still run on it.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.120]   Has Amazon done a video playback app for Android?
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.000]   For Android Android?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.200]   Or only for Kindle Fire?
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.680]   I think just the Kindle Fire.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.760]   I was wondering about that.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.480]   No.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.200]   Because they have--
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.800]   That's a very good point.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   I cannot watch Amazon movies on this.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   I don't think you can.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.280]   That's a very good point.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.440]   Anybody in the chat room, can you watch Amazon movies
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.320]   on your Android phone?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.200]   I don't think so.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.040]   Or on your iOS device, either.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.360]   No.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   Right.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.380]   No.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.280]   The only reason why these Amazon is I can download to my Tivo.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.840]   Well, you can, but you're going to do it for the web
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   and with Flash.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.200]   Right.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.800]   You can do it right.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.200]   Certainly you can do it on the web to Flash.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.160]   You can do it on Google TV.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.880]   And it's Flash.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   And it crashes a lot.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.360]   And it--
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.720]   Yeah, it gets the OSNAP.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   A lot of OSNAPs.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.560]   Yeah, a lot of OSNAPs on that.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.800]   I always download Amazon stuff to my Tivo.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   Which is paying because you have to say send a Tivo and then you
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.500]   have to wait for it to download.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.140]   So I'm willing to switch to Google Play Store
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.620]   if I can get it on my TV.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.140]   Well, get ready because for a mere $300,
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.460]   I don't know why 199 seems like such a good deal for the Nexus
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.340]   7 and 299 seems such a bad deal for this cube.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.660]   But it does.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.940]   They're the cube, I should say.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.440]   Cute.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.300]   It's anything but a cube.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.260]   It seems like a bad deal because that's three Apple TVs.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.900]   And the other thing that's tuned away
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.780]   to price has a screen.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.020]   So it's like, what did you put in there?
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.180]   And apparently the people saying the cost is they put a really
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.860]   good audio amplifier in there.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.300]   And now that's an interesting point.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.620]   So there's a 25 watt--
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.100]   There's a 25 watt--
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.340]   Right.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.700]   Even Sonos, which is probably the most direct competitor
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.060]   for this, sells a connect--
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.380]   it's $350.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.180]   It's a little more expensive--
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.660]   that lets you connect to the internet.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.540]   It's Sonos uses a proprietary network, not your Wi-Fi.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.900]   It uses a mesh network.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.940]   And it doesn't have an amplifier and the Sonos connect.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.900]   But I--
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.700]   But you know, Apple--
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.020]   And I have one of those and I like it because I'm
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.380]   into the Sonos ecosystem.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.700]   But Apple says two things here.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.540]   Apple sells the Apple TV, which is $99, does this, does the TV.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.460]   And you can't hook it up to your own speakers.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.100]   You can be--
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:44.700]   HDMI.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.980]   You have to use an HDMI cable and go to a TV--
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.820]   You're right, or your AV is--
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.820]   which is all they said this did.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.140]   Which is how I do it.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.340]   But Apple also sells the little Wi-Fi extender thingy
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.380]   that has an audio socket on it that they've sold for years.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.380]   Yeah, but what airports press?
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.260]   It would express that you can plug any headphone jack
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.740]   into it because--
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:00.740]   Absolutely.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.940]   --that's analog.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.420]   That's analog out.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:03.980]   So I don't--
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.340]   And that's cheaper than-- you know, that's still--
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.700]   Now--
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.860]   That's a hundred bucks or something, right?
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.380]   One of the reasons it's so expensive, it's made in America.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.220]   Yes, it is.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.900]   Made in USA.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.220]   They made a point to kind of zoom in on that label,
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.180]   kind of on the inside.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.460]   That's very interesting.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.100]   Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.100]   That made me really happy.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.460]   And they're pushing the social aspect of this.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:20.980]   OK.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:21.980]   They're calling it the first.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.140]   It drove me nuts.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.060]   OK, you come over to my house, I'm playing some music,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.780]   you take over my playlist.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.420]   That sucks.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.100]   No, but I call over your house and say, Leo,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.420]   did you see this kit video?
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.620]   Then you can add it, and you can add to it.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.300]   You got to see this.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.540]   You got to see this YouTube video.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.100]   That happens.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.100]   Exactly.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   We really don't want you to do it.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.820]   Did you see this kit and video?
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.300]   Come on.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.620]   But you don't do that with your friends.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.340]   You don't go like, oh, I'm passing around the little screen.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.820]   I do it with Airplay, yeah.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.260]   Oh, have you seen this thing?
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.660]   OK, you see this thing.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.660]   And then you say, yeah, Apple already has a solution.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.300]   But it's screen sharing.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.780]   They're saying, this is a playlist.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.980]   You can see the playlist on the screen.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.820]   You can manipulate it.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.780]   So it's kind of a turntable--
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.140]   Dave MacDian, our chat room, says a great idea.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.980]   I have music listening parties with my friends all the time.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.660]   And also movies.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.180]   Like, oh, hey, I bought this movie on the Google Play Store.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.700]   It's awesome.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.500]   Let's watch it.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.100]   Well, now that's not going to--
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.580]   I would guess that's not going to work,
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.820]   because I would guess.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.220]   But I don't know that the queue is logged into--
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:11.980]   No, they said that--
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980]   They said that does work.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.820]   That's what it's going to do.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.660]   Be your friend's house with your Android device.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.060]   And you say, hey, let's watch this movie.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:17.700]   It pulls it from the cloud.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.700]   On my account.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.020]   Yeah, it pulls it from the cloud.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.340]   It just says, yeah, it's a tech account.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.420]   The queue is not registered to the home users account.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.740]   No, the queue is registered to the home users account.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.060]   But when you log into it on the Wi-Fi,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.020]   it inherits the accounts of all the people who are there.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.260]   Yeah, like it recognizes devices.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.260]   That was fun.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   I think it-- that's cool.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.420]   So that was the neat part.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.420]   And that's the piece.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.020]   So I could bring a movie over in a--
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.520]   Right.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.020]   Right.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   I could pay for the movie.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.540]   Right.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.460]   It's doing-- OK, I'm good.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.540]   Ah, I'm back on my day.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.380]   When we did--
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.420]   Did you bring your set over?
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.740]   Here, I brought a VCR cassette.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.340]   No, I'm-- the analogy for me is the thing we did with iTunes.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.540]   When I was at Apple, which was, you can see all the machines
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.180]   in the room and everyone's connection and play that.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.660]   Right.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.160]   Right?
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.060]   And that was very cool.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.820]   Right.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.180]   Even if you weren't attached, you brought a laptop in.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.380]   And that actually did work over the net.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.940]   But Apple had to turn that off because the label's got grumpy.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.980]   So I was somewhat involved with that.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.500]   And the version we shipped would play anything over any URL.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.620]   And so you could actually subscribe to anyone's music
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.140]   anywhere, but it would find the local ones easily.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.460]   And then that gradually got turned off as the label was going,
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.860]   you can play music while the people's houses.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.820]   What the hell is that?
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.260]   Not going to allow that.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.220]   Now, you can buy multiple $300 queues
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.820]   and put them around the house and plug in your own speakers.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.900]   So it could have a sonos like--
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.380]   So if you--
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.180]   Yeah, well, the sonos is up against clearly.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.220]   It's dead on the rival.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.860]   It's just bizarre compared to the Apple TV.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.020]   That's the piece that I don't get.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   I don't understand it.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.700]   Apple is selling something in every retail mall in America
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.060]   for a third of the price.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.060]   They're just the same thing.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.820]   If they made this $99, it might have a chance.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.780]   At $300, I think it has zero chance.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.540]   Am I off base on that?
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.060]   Also--
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.100]   I want to play with it a little bit.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.220]   It doesn't have the screen sharing airplane thing.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.380]   They explicitly said it doesn't do that.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.120]   And that is the other--
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.300]   Apple TV is worth buying just for that, actually.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.020]   Wait, what's the screen sharing?
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.300]   So Apple TV, you can--
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.820]   from your iPad or your iPod or your phone,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.100]   you can go to the bottom and say, share my screen to that.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.180]   And it goes on to the TV.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.500]   Oh, and so then whatever you're doing--
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   So the way you're doing can be--
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.100]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.860]   And that's become the way we do presentations at work.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.740]   So everyone has an iPad.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.700]   And we just have one of those.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.940]   And you just push into that and stuff, get shared around like that.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.440]   Right.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.380]   And they just announced at the Apple thing last week,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.780]   the week before, that the next version of Mac OS,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.740]   we're able to send to that as well.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.580]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.580]   So it doesn't do the--
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.260]   it doesn't do the sharing.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.620]   It does do the screen sharing.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.100]   The nice thing it does is it does--
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.860]   you're not having to push.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.180]   The problem with the Apple AirPort Express one
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.340]   is that you have to have your Mac open and it
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.180]   and iTunes running to send sound to it,
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.740]   whereas this one is just queue them up
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.900]   and it'll pull them and play them.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.740]   That is actually a better decision.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.100]   And I can see that making more sense.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.220]   But wait, for $400 you could buy a pair of bookshelf speakers
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.420]   on the Google Play Store that will then turn your Google
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.140]   queue into a stereo.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.780]   Right.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   To me, the differentiator is the app.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.300]   Right?
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:22.940]   That's it.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.700]   But that-- yeah.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.220]   But--
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.180]   You know, amps are not magical things.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:26.900]   Turn that expensive either.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.900]   And if I am the kind of person who cares about amps,
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.580]   I've already got a separate pre-empirate power system
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.300]   and a whole bunch of expensive high-fi kits
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.700]   from the expensive high-fi kits store.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.100]   I think Logitech is just saying, thank God,
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.620]   we didn't license this.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.660]   That's all I'm thinking when I see it.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.660]   Well, you know, I'm assuming that at some point they'll go,
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.740]   OK, we'll license this and you'll get third party ones that
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.860]   don't have an amp in them.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.780]   They just have an HDMI cable.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.580]   Well, is there technology in here that you could like?
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.260]   I mean, what is the--
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.820]   Wait, it's Android.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.700]   Oh, it's Android.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.300]   It's a little Android device.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.940]   They said it's running the same chip as the tablet.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.900]   Also, it's micro HDMI.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.940]   What kind of--
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.420]   It's not a-- in fact, the connectors in general
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.180]   are a little odd.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.900]   You have to have banana plugs for your speaker wire.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.860]   They're banana plugs.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.180]   They're not--
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.820]   They're banana jacks.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.660]   No.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.940]   So--
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.740]   No, I mean, everything--
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.620]   That means there's going to be a sudden run on a banana
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.820]   plug.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.380]   I happen to have banana plugs at home
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.300]   if anybody wants to borrow them.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.820]   Micro HDMI, which is a type DHTMI.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.460]   It's not a standard.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.660]   It's why this space were a full-size one, man.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.260]   There's plenty of space.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.100]   It has ethernet.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.940]   I presume it has Wi-Fi.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.780]   And then it has a TOS link.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.700]   It has optical out.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.500]   I don't think this is particularly competitive.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.100]   I think Sonos is here first.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.140]   I think Apple TV, if you're price sensitive.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.540]   I don't-- I just don't see this.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.740]   I don't know if it's crucial where it fits.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.500]   Especially with Google TV.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.020]   Right.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.540]   Which we'll see presumably tomorrow, right?
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.300]   Yeah, presumably.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.220]   It's kind of weird.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.100]   But this is the first device they said
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.180]   that Google has designed completely from the ground up.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.580]   You know what?
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.380]   It is pretty.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:03.900]   It's pretty.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.860]   It's got 39 LEDs that you can program to do anything you want.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.460]   What do we say?
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.980]   It looks like the training device, the Jedi training device.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.540]   You said that.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.300]   That was a good line.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.940]   Yeah, that was a good line.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.100]   That looks like the ball that Luke Skywalker used.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.060]   Or the Death Star.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.020]   You know, depending on how you want to look at it.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.540]   Use your mind, Luke.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.940]   There, it looks even better with the banana plugs in.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.660]   I don't have it up.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.900]   That looks like an oud.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.260]   That's a little scary looking.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.500]   It looks like something's good.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.780]   You remember the oud?
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.220]   You've watched "Up To Who?"
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.940]   They don't want to talk to you.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.260]   They squid line to things like this.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:37.820]   And they carry goggles.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.140]   They've watched "Glee" because that's a great show.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:40.820]   Nice to meet you guys.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.580]   It's up to you.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.220]   I hope you're enjoying our best of 2012 on this week in Google.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.260]   Our show today brought to you as so many of our shows this year
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.820]   have been by the Ford Motor Company.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.980]   I'm a big Ford fan.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.060]   I don't have to tell you that.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.140]   You've seen me driving around.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.620]   If you're in Petaloma, you know that Santa
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.780]   drives a red Ford Mustang with twit license plates.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.420]   Let me tell you.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:01.980]   I'm going--
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.620]   I love my Mustang.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.780]   And I'm going to be sad to see it go.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.740]   But yes, I'm trading it in because frankly, I
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.420]   want the 2013 Ford Fusion.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.820]   I'm going to get the energy, the plug-in hybrid fusion.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.500]   But the other thing I want is some of the hot new technologies
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.340]   Ford's putting in its vehicles like the Bliss Blind Spot
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.820]   Information System with Cross Traffic Alert.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.620]   It lets me know if there's people in the lanes in my blind spot
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.660]   so I don't pull into them with a little light, little tone.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.060]   It also lets me know as I'm backing out of a parking spot
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.500]   if there's car oncoming traffic.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.100]   It's so cool.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.780]   These are little sensors in the rear of the car,
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.500]   probably radar or something like it.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.580]   There's active park assist, which uses cameras.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.340]   That's amazing.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.820]   You press the button on the dashboard,
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.300]   say, I want to park somewhere around here.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.620]   Watch for a space.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.500]   The camera's spot a space that fits your car.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.340]   They'll notify you.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.380]   And then you go, OK, and you'll lean back,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.100]   and you let the car park itself in 24 seconds.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.460]   Perfect parallel parking.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.620]   Every time.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.900]   If you've never experienced it, it's truly amazing.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.460]   And frankly, I think it gives me high hope
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.740]   for the future of autonomous vehicles.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.940]   It just works perfectly.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.780]   I want you to try it.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.980]   Go to a Ford dealer near you.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.100]   Say, I want to test drive the Bliss System or the active park
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.260]   assist.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.340]   And of course, if you're in the market for a new vehicle,
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.860]   the 2013 Ford Fusion and the 2013 Ford Taurus
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.180]   both have available Bliss and active park assist.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.060]   You can also go to the website, Ford.com/technology
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.180]   to learn more.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.900]   Thank you, Ford.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   We really appreciate your support on this week in Google.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:39.620]   Now, back we go to the best of 2012.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.140]   Fortunately, I think one of the benefits of this week
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.060]   in Google is we've got such a smart team.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.380]   We've got Jeff Jarvis, who's an expert in new media
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.660]   and journalism.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.220]   And we've got Gina Trapani, who's a programmer
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:59.500]   and an Android developer, and understands things like APIs
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   and SDKs.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.300]   And certainly, her program Think Up,
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.740]   which is a program designed to analyze tweets,
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.300]   is very much impacted by the Twitter API.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.900]   Gina was there to explain what the new Twitter API means
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.220]   to people like her watch.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.260]   All right, let's talk.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.460]   Let's talk Twitter.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.180]   Is it been-- was it this--
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.140]   it feels like I've been talking about this API change
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.060]   for a long time.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.980]   It happened right after the last show when we had the discussion
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.620]   about App.net.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.700]   Right after that is when all this stuff--
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.500]   Isn't that funny?
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.580]   Dalton's timing is pretty darn good with App.net.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.220]   It was Thursday last week.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.020]   Marco, I first became aware with Marco Arment's post.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.900]   He's the creator of Instapaper, interpreting
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.420]   some of Twitter's API changes.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.740]   And this, what I would say, is arguably the gloomiest
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.020]   interpretation.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.020]   Yes.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.460]   There are those, including the guy at TapBots, which
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.260]   is one of the top iOS Twitter clients who said,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.580]   ah, no, it's fine.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.620]   No way about it.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.460]   But here's-- this all comes from a post on the Twitter blog
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:07.180]   by Michael Sippy titled, Changes are Coming in version 1.1
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.660]   of the Twitter API.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.940]   It gets weird after that.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:18.300]   For instance, you can't detach photos in the Twitter stream
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.340]   and put them on another window.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.220]   No other third party or social actions
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.660]   could be attached to a tweet.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.380]   In effect, tweets have to be published exactly as Twitter
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.020]   specifies, no matter where you're publishing them.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:39.900]   Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.820]   may not be rendered with non-Twitter content comments,
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.260]   updates from other networks, or presumably circles arrows.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.620]   Whoa, but they said Spotify was fine.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.420]   No Spotify, a storeify was fine.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.860]   But that's exactly what you can do in storeify is annotate.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   Right.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.460]   How could they do it?
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.660]   It's not your content, Twitter.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.060]   Oh, that's really what the battle is, isn't it?
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.860]   Whose tweets are these anyway?
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.300]   Geez.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   Flipboard's Mike McEw left Twitter's board, apparently,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.300]   recently.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.060]   And Marco assumes because of these APIs,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   because I imagine it's going to affect Flipboard.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.460]   One of the-- this is quoting from the post.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.900]   "One of the key things we've learned over the past few years--
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.060]   this is from Twitter, Michael Sippy--
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.740]   is that when developers begin to demand an increasingly
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.900]   high volume of API calls, we can guide them
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.100]   towards area of value for users and their businesses."
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.220]   To that end, and similar to some other companies,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.620]   we will require you to work with us directly.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.820]   If you believe your application will need more than 1 million
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.460]   individual user tokens.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.100]   And if 1 million sounds like a small number,
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.180]   you'll need our permission if your application will
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.100]   require more than 100,000 individual user tokens
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.580]   if you're using our user streams product, 100,000.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.220]   However, you could be grandfathered in.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.060]   That's why the tapbox guy is not upset.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.900]   He says, well, you get double what you've got now.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.340]   And this is specific to traditional Twitter clients,
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.940]   not other kinds of Twitter products.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.620]   Like Flipboard.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.180]   Oh, it's just clients.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.580]   Yeah, traditional Twitter clients.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.380]   The 100,000 user token permission kind of ceiling
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.420]   applies to clients that make large amounts of calls
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.740]   to certain endpoints that map to traditional clients.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.620]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.540]   So only Twitter clients, like traditional Twitter clients,
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.900]   are going to get hit by this 100,000 user token ceiling.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.380]   Well, that's significant because that means
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.980]   you, without Twitter's permission,
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.380]   you can't have more than 100,000 users.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.460]   Right, if you need a traditional Twitter client,
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.860]   but so something like Starify isn't a traditional Twitter
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.860]   client, right?
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   It's like a curation site.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   But the Starify--
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   But the Starify--
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.220]   Go ahead.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.460]   Well, but let me understand, though.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.900]   But the earlier things that Leo listed
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.540]   about how you can't interspers other content,
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.900]   you must display the tweet is the full tweet.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.300]   You may not put any other social action upon it.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.900]   That's not just for Twitter clients.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.020]   That's for any--
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.740]   That's for everyone.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.740]   Use the API.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.620]   That's for the Huffington Post or Starify.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:20.100]   Display requirements do apply to all apps.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.140]   But yeah, the user cap is targeted
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.900]   toward traditional Twitter clients.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.580]   I mean, Twitter's been telling us for 18 months
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.020]   that they are discouraging developers
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.620]   from making new traditional clients.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.980]   They're saying this area is saturated
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.780]   and we want you to build on Twitter,
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.980]   but we want you to make products that are not
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.140]   traditional Twitter clients because we've
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   got those already.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.340]   That's basically what they've been saying
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.260]   for the past 18 months.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.500]   And these guidelines changes are just kind of like--
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.940]   And this is how we're going to provide that guidance.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.620]   Paul had that.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.700]   A tap bot's response.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.300]   Don't panic.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.980]   There's been a lot of fear, uncertain,
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.940]   and that generated by Twitter's latest announcement.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.860]   I wanted everyone to know the world is an ending tweetbot
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.100]   for the Mac is still coming out.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.860]   They're in beta now.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.340]   Tweetbot for iOS isn't going anywhere.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.580]   He says, "The changes to the API won't affect tweetbot.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   All current API calls are made using authentica.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.540]   That's the authentication requirement."
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.420]   That's appropriate, by the way, right?
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.180]   Yeah, I mean, it's the thing.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.140]   Like, as a Hama developer, I build Twitter product.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.580]   I'm building-- it uses the Twitter API
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.380]   as part of its primary function along
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.060]   with lots of other APIs, Facebook and Bitly and Google+,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.540]   et cetera.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.540]   And I read these changes.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.620]   They're about five major bullet points.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.780]   Three of them are great.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.260]   Awesome.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.020]   Per endpoint rate limiting, awesome.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.860]   Verifying pre-installed clients, awesome.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.220]   OAuth across the board, awesome.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.740]   There's one that's like, meh, because it really depends
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.620]   on how they enforce it.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.100]   That's the display requirements.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.140]   And then there's one that's pretty
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.340]   yucky for traditional client developers, which
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.580]   is that user token ceiling.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.340]   But I have to tell you, as a developer,
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.340]   I was really frustrated with what I thought
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.540]   was wildly sensationalized and oversimplified.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.740]   And I thought that was a really--
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.780]   I just thought that was a mischaracterization
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.300]   of what's going on.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.540]   I definitely think that there are troubling parts
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.780]   to this announcement.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   But the majority of it is actually really great
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.900]   for developers.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.940]   And I felt like there was just a lot of misunderstanding
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.460]   there.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.740]   And I thought, Marco has a section in his post
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.380]   about how there's a lot of subjectivity and uncertainty
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.940]   here, because Twitter, very specific,
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.060]   is a very interesting thing.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.060]   And I think we have a right to go crazy.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.260]   But I think for the most part, these aren't.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.300]   I know I read these and I have a lot of questions.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   I think that's a lot of the questions
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.700]   that I've been talking about.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.580]   And I think that's a lot of the questions
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.100]   that I've been talking about.

[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.540]   that I've been talking about.

[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.420]   about.

[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.180]   about.

[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   that I've been talking about.

[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   about.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.980]   about.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.980]   about.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:21.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   about.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.980]   about.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   about.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   And I think that's a lot of the questions that I've been talking
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.980]   about.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.980]   And I think that there are just parts of that announcement
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.980]   that were very dealt developer specific.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.980]   I think there are a lot of people saying Twitter is turning
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   their backs on developers who don't really understand what
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.980]   per endpoint rate limiting really is and why it really is a
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.980]   period of what they offer now.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   So, yeah.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.980]   When they say per endpoint, they don't mean per app.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   They mean per user.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   They mean per API endpoint.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   So the Twitter API provides a set of endpoints.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   So an endpoint would be like a kind of question you'd ask
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.980]   your API.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.980]   So an endpoint might be the home timeline.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.980]   The endpoint might be your direct messages or your profile.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   These are all different like questions that you can ask the
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   API.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   So right now you get 350 calls per hour across all endpoints per
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.980]   user.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.980]   This change you get 60 calls per endpoint per hour.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   So if you use more than six endpoints, right, because 6960 is
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   360 and 360 is greater than 350.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.980]   I know I'm doing this quickly.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.980]   You basically what Twitter is doing is they're saying you get
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   more API calls per hour across a lot of endpoints with this change,
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.980]   which puts the squeeze on traditional client apps,
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.980]   traditional Twitter clients, which are constantly querying the
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   home timeline endpoint, right, primarily.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   They're using one endpoint over and over.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.980]   They're using one endpoint a lot over and over exactly versus
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   products that use lots of different endpoints that do something
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   interesting with favorites or do something interesting with, you
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   know, which things think up does.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   Think up does do that.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   So I mean, I mean, I can.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   Good for you.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   Bad for tweet bot.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   All right.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:02.980]   Right.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.980]   I mean, just on top of my head, think of uses over nine endpoints,
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   right?
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   So that already that ups our API call allocation in 350 an hour to
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.980]   5, 40 an hour.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.980]   So that's like, that's great news.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   That's great news for us.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   And sweet bot doesn't seem too concerned about it.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.980]   Honestly, even if you're a traditional Twitter client and
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.980]   you're being conservative, you're being smart and conservative
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   about about your API calls, 60 per hour per endpoint is totally
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.980]   reasonable.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.980]   Because so tweet bot could make one call and then feed all of
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.980]   its clients with that one call.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.980]   So they're saying every second or every minute you make.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.980]   It's per user per endpoint, right?
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   So like a video.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   Yeah, it's per user per endpoint.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   So you authenticated, you have tokens and your timeline is
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   different than is that, you know, if you hit the timeline endpoint,
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.980]   that the response is going to be the payload is going to be
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   different than if I hit it, right?
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.980]   Because my time on timeline looks different than yours.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.980]   So it's per user per endpoint, 60 per hour.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.980]   So in the, in a Neil's blog, he said, our biggest Twitter API
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   upgrade ever more API calls for almost every kind of app.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   Better security by extending OAuth to all APIs, a clear road map
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.980]   for Twitter app developers to know what's encouraged a few new
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   restrictions for people making traditional Twitter clients.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.980]   And when official 1.1 is released, you'll have six months to
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   migrate.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.980]   Some have posited as like Dan Fromer and ReadWriteWeb.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.980]   This is, this is Twitter saying we want to survive.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.980]   They have to do this.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.980]   Does that seem reasonable, Gina?
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.980]   It's not a, not a land, not a money grab.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.980]   They need to, they need to monetize.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   I don't know, but that's not, that seems to be, right?
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.980]   I mean, it seems to be why they're doing this.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   This is where, this is one area where I think their communications
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.980]   could have been different.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.980]   I mean, you want to assume that they have, they want to restrict
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.980]   the display of tweets because they want to be able to insert
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   advertising or insert links back to Twitter wherever they can,
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   right?
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.980]   Because they need the eyeballs and they have to keep, they want to
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   keep Twitter users using their tools for the primary use of
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   Twitter, which is your timeline, your replies, direct messages.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.980]   So yeah, this seems like this is about their business model.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.980]   I don't think, I agree that this isn't a money grab.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.980]   I think this is Twitter figuring out that it needs, it needs a
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   business model and figuring out how it's going to do that.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.980]   And they're taking the long view and saying we're going to start
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.980]   this now.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   If they did anything wrong, it's that they didn't think of this
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   ahead of time.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   Right?
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   Well, look, they've been giving us this guy, 18 months they've
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.980]   been saying, hey, like we got, we got the client area covered,
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   make other things.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:33.980]   Stop doing that.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   Right.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.980]   The unfairness, Google said, the founders of Google said we don't
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.980]   like advertising, we don't want advertising.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   Right.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.980]   You know, and I said that when I started this network, boy, that
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.980]   was a mistake.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   Right.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.980]   So I'll give them all that.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.980]   I think what probably disturbs people is two things.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.980]   One is, yeah, the cultural attitude of it.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.980]   People do feel as if they really contributed to Twitter's
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   success by creating conventions, by distributing Twitter, by helping
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.980]   make it popular.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.980]   And so the attitude was not, let me be fully open here and explain
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   what we need to do and why we need to do it.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.980]   And yes, we're grateful what you did, but this is the reality of
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   what we have to deal with.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.980]   People would deal with that, I think.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.980]   They should probably accept that.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.980]   The second part of this, I think, and this is from my ignorant,
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.980]   non-developing view, and I'm grappling with this in a lot of
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.980]   context, is what's the responsibility of a platform and
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.980]   what's the, thus the reliability and trust you can have in a
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.980]   platform to build your future on it.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.980]   I'm reminded of, and I think I've told this trip before, but I
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.980]   took day life, originally to Fred Wilson.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.980]   He said to the founder, you're penishardenon, can I build a
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   profitable company on your platform?
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   And let me tell you before you answer that the right answer is
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:41.980]   yes.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   Really?
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.980]   And when I complained about some features that were not
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.980]   existing, existent in Twitter, Fred responded publicly, well,
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.980]   that's what the, you know, the clients are supposed to make, the
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.980]   outside developers are supposed to make.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   So there's a compact there.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   There's a relationship there, a covenant that can change and
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.980]   perhaps has to change.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.980]   I'm not denying that at all, but I just think it does come out
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.980]   of the way of the communication to say, okay, folks, we've tried a
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.980]   lot of things.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.980]   Here's where we are, and here's the reality of that.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   And we want to bring you along, but you got to play by these
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.980]   rules to come along.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.980]   And then I think it'll be a little bit different.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.980]   And Neil has a real good point then is, but it's not just about
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.980]   gloss over what exists.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.980]   It's also about being transparent about the rationale, what's
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   going on, A, and B, about trying to maintain ongoing trust.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.980]   Because what Marco's post says at the end, I believe it was his
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.980]   post said, I ain't building on Twitter.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.980]   Well, that's the issue at the end.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.980]   Is if there's no trust there, then are they really willing to go
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:40.980]   alone?
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.980]   And the irony of this is, then Twitter does become a media
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   company, it becomes a very old fashioned media company.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.980]   Well, just as I'm telling media companies to make themselves
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.980]   embeddable and spread their stuff out on the web, Twitter's
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.980]   saying, no, no, no, you all have to come to our website.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.980]   We want our page views.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   That's so 2005.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:57.980]   Right.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.980]   I mean, if developers interpret this announcement as a giant
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.980]   FU, which many have, obviously Marco did, and said that he might
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.980]   not, you know, he might just rip all the Twitter related features
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.980]   out of InstaPaper because he can't bear to develop against
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.980]   Twitter's ever changing rules anymore, which again, I thought
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.980]   his reaction was extreme.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.980]   You know, if he interpreted that way, the risk is that you're
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   not going to have a Twitter developer come along and say, you
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.980]   know what I want to do?
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.980]   I want to build a business making a really awesome Twitter
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.980]   client that does all the things that none of the official
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.980]   clients do.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.980]   Right.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.980]   I mean, that's how Tweety happened.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.980]   That's how Tweety deck happened, which got acquired by Twitter.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:36.980]   Right.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.980]   So that's how that innovation happened in the beginning.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.980]   That innovation is not going to happen now because a developer
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.980]   in a right mind is going to build, are going to try to build a
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.980]   company and a product with a cap of 100,000 user tokens at which
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.980]   point you have to kind of apply for permission from Twitter to
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:53.980]   continue.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.980]   Exactly.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.980]   So I think that's a really important thing to do.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:04.980]   I think that's why we have to build a new company called Powerlands
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.980]   and Stock Twits and Twitter took over the convention.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.980]   I would include Bitly on this.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.980]   The funny thing is the various people who still work with
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.980]   Twitter and some other eye-sensor being so cautious.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.980]   But, you know, I'm cautious in becoming hypercritical of
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   Twitter here because I've made mistakes before when it comes to
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:21.980]   Twitter.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.980]   I'm sensitive to something in one country, but leave it in
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   other countries and make it transparent.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:27.980]   I didn't get by that, though.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.980]   What they were doing was exposing censorship.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   You know, it was a good thing.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.980]   So, but I'm also a little gunshot with Twitter now after the
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.980]   Olympics and what they did with Guy Adams account.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.980]   That was a cultural problem of not understanding their
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.980]   responsibility as a platform.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.980]   And when I argue that media companies now to become platforms,
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.980]   that's why I'm grappling with this.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.980]   What does it mean to be a platform?
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   Sun Jake says, "Yeah, you build your business on someone
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980]   else's platform.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.980]   You get what you deserve when they pull out the rug."
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.980]   Right.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   You know, I kind of agree.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.980]   It's funny.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.980]   I was saying on Twitter that we have to wait to see how Twitter
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   actually enforces a lot of this stuff before we can truly
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.980]   criticize.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.980]   And Mache from Pinboard and Jason Kaki,
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.980]   you do a stellar.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.980]   They both said to me, "What do you mean you're not supposed to
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.980]   protest a law until someone gets arrested for it?"
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.980]   And I was like, "But Twitter isn't a democracy.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.980]   We're not voting about whether or not this is okay.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.980]   I mean, after that was--"
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.980]   But with the last, Twitter is nothing.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   The first rule in time--
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.980]   I wrote a post about trying to explore these notions of a
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.980]   platform and simply put, without users, a platform is nothing.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.980]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.980]   So it may not be a democracy, but it is a collaboration.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:39.980]   And if it's not collaborating two ways, then it doesn't work
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.980]   as a platform because there's not two-way trust.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.980]   Right.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:44.980]   Absolutely.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:45.980]   Absolutely.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:46.980]   That's true.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.980]   My point was, if I'm going to be outraged if Twitter indeed
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.980]   bans an app for having an email, this tweet link in it,
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.980]   that no social actions bit, which could be interpreted very
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   broadly, like, I'll feel more outraged and I'll feel like
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.980]   they're truly evil if they really don't want us to email tweets.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.980]   For example, or share a link to InstaPaper from a tweet,
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.980]   which is what Marco brought up in his post.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:14.980]   But people were saying that we should protest these changes
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.980]   now before we actually start to see enforcement.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.980]   I mean, I'm going to learn a lot about enforcement because I'm
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   building a Twitter product.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.980]   So I'll let you know if we get pulled over for something.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.980]   But I think you're going to--
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.980]   But Gina, isn't it weird that you're saying that you are not
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.980]   going to build it to the letter of the law because you're assuming
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.980]   they don't mean the law?
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   No, I'm going to comply with the display requirements.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.980]   I'm going to comply with the changes, what Twitter's asking
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.980]   me to do, whatever terms I've accepted when I said I want to use
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.980]   this API, I'm going to comply with.
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:50.980]   But, like, for example, the Android example, I think, is a good
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.980]   one.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.980]   Android, you have sort of a built-in share menu, right?
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.980]   You can tap something and say, share this to email, share this to
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.980]   messaging.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.980]   That's a social action if you interpret that very broadly.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   You know, is Twitter really going--am I going to take that,
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.980]   for example, menu, I had to disable that menu on tweets because
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:10.980]   if you interpret this guideline very, very strictly, you know,
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.980]   Twitter might ban the app?
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   No, of course not.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   I'm going to leave it in there.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.980]   And if Twitter calls me out on it, then I'm going to pound my
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   fist and say that they've gone evil.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   Now, I'm going to go back to your point about democracy.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.980]   It's not an democracy.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.980]   You're absolutely right.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.980]   But Twitter has to acknowledge publicly that it depends upon you
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.980]   developers.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.980]   And I think that they did at the beginning.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   I was at a conference where Biz Stone was asked along with Chad
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   Hurley and Reid Hoffman from by Wall Street Guy, what big company
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.980]   do you want to deal with?
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   They looked at them like they were confused German shepherds
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   with their heads cocks.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.980]   They were like, "No, our users and our developers distribute us.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   We rely on our ecosystem."
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   It's a member of an ecosystem.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.980]   And let me just do this real fast.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.980]   But when I wrote the post, I tried to come up with some rules
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.980]   for platforms.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.980]   The first, I think, is that users come first.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.980]   If you don't believe in that, then you're creating a walled
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.980]   garden, you're creating a service.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.980]   Hey, user or loser, we don't care.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:10.980]   It's like a telephone company.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   Second, a platform is defined by its users.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.980]   If it's truly a platform, you don't necessarily know how
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.980]   everyone will use it.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   Only through its use do you learn what it is.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   The platform is collaborate.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   If you don't collaborate, it's a dead thing.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   A platform changes.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.980]   And the platforms need principles that a platform, I think,
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:26.980]   should be transparent.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.980]   It should enable portability.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.980]   These are principles.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.980]   And that it has to be reliable.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.980]   If you can't rely on it, if you cannot trust it,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   to be what you think it is going to be, if you can't rely on it,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.980]   to at least be transparent about its changes, then is it really a
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.980]   platform?
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.980]   Now, is Twitter a platform then?
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.980]   Or is it becoming AOL?
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.980]   People always say, oh, Facebook is the next walled garden
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:51.980]   the next AOL.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.980]   Is Twitter trying to become the next AOL?
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.980]   Can you be a platform for people but not a platform for
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   developers?
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.980]   I don't know.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.980]   Because I think people are developers.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.980]   Even if you don't write code, right?
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   The people who put in hashtag or @sign in Twitter.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   That's true.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.980]   But they're not disenfranchised.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   People would use it.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.980]   So in other words, people are you, I would say, I would submit
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:22.980]   that these API changes affect developers.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   And so, Twitter might be saying, we don't want to be a platform
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.980]   for developers.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.980]   We want to be a platform for people.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:30.980]   For people.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.980]   For people.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:32.980]   For Justin Bieber fans.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.980]   And it's less about power users and developers and more about
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   regular people.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   That's not unreasonable.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   Is it?
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Right.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   In fact, a lot of these changes empower regular users, right?
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   So getting your app certified, apps that come pre-installed
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.980]   and devices must be certified.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   The display requirements are going to, those things are going
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:58.980]   to reduce confusion and make a consistent experience, right?
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.980]   So I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   And I think that's the best way to do that.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   And I think that community wants, there's plenty of places
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.980]   that Tech Community can go.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:35.980]   Twitter is pretty much saying we want to be for real people.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   We want a business model.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.980]   And I don't think real people know or care about APIs, 50 bucks,
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   stewardship platforms or anything else.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   If you think people are seeking out non-Twitter clients,
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.980]   I mean, regular people are typing Twitter into the App Store search
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.980]   box, right?
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   They're not typing in--
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.980]   They don't have to because it comes with the iPhone.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.980]   Oh, right.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.980]   So they don't--
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.980]   And that's what Twitter wants, by the way, right?
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.980]   Yes, Twitter does it.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.980]   But Twitter built itself on the back of those platforms.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.980]   Yeah, that was a mistake.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   And that was my question is, should Twitter--
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   Is it a mistake though?
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.980]   Thought of this earlier?
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.980]   Could Twitter be what Twitter is without those developers?
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:14.980]   I would argue absolutely not.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   No, I agree too.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.980]   Twitter, without the @sign, would be useless.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.980]   Twitter, without the hashtag, would not allow people to organize
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   revolutions.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.980]   And all of that came from third parties, not from Twitter.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   Absolutely.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.980]   Twitter's not smart.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   Twitter's smart, but it's not smart enough to build Twitter.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   But putting myself in Twitter's shoes, I would say, well, that's
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.980]   true, but now we need to survive.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.980]   We need to monetize.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.980]   And we need to be a less confusing, more consistent platform
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   for the real people who are using us.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.980]   That was then this is now.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   That's my question.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.980]   Don't develop on it.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   Right.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.980]   And don't develop on it.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   We'll take it from here.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   Is it immoral or dishonorable to have built a company on developers
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   backs at five years later to say, hey, you know, that's nice.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.980]   Thanks.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980]   We've got enough clients.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   They're not saying to tap bots, don't make, you know, tweet
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   bot anymore.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.980]   They're just saying no more new ones.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.980]   Although they'd like to--
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   They're saying you can make it, but you know, at 100,000 user
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.980]   tokens, you're going to have to talk to us if you want to go beyond that.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:19.980]   Right.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:21.980]   I think-- I know.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.980]   I'm not defending Twitter by any means, but I think I understand
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.980]   what they're saying.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.980]   It's how--
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   Now, what my question is, is it wrong?
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:30.980]   Is it bad?
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.980]   Is it hubris--
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   It's hubris-tick.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   It's hubris-tick.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.980]   It's thinking that they can go it alone now.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   And it's like weasily in that it rejects a community that made
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   them what they are.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.980]   Weasily.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:42.980]   They're saying we got this, right?
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.980]   So the reason why Twitter was built on the backs of developers,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   really, it was users making up new conventions like app replies
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   and retweets and independent developers being faster than Twitter
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.980]   proper to make clients to support those things, because Twitter
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.980]   proper was so small and unproven and was just dealing with stopping
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.980]   the fail-whale every day, right?
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.980]   Exactly.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   But now Twitter's got the infrastructure and the team and the
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.980]   clients, and they're basically saying we got this.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   Any new traditional client features we can handle.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   We're building cards.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.980]   We're innovating internally.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   So we got this.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.980]   You guys do the other stuff.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.980]   So it is a little bit of hubris.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.980]   Here's the analog.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:29.980]   OS X is built on an open source kernel, mock kernel, and BSD.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   So they built up-- now Apple never made a promise to that community
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.980]   and they made a little bit of a promise.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   We'll give back Darwin, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.980]   But they're built on IMDB.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   There are many, many-- CDDB is actually the most accurate
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   analog, which was a database of CD information that was created
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   by users, which went basically private.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.980]   And they said, OK, we got it from here.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   It happens a lot, actually.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.980]   So is it a moral?
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.980]   Is it unethical for a community to grow and change?
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.980]   Especially if you accept the premise that they couldn't survive.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.980]   I think that's the crux of it.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.980]   Do they have to do this?
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.980]   Is it greed or was it necessity?
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.980]   We don't know because they really haven't told us.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.980]   And Dan fromers says it was necessity.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.980]   What's the downside of-- so I guess the downside is we must put ads
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.980]   and tweets and if those ads don't appear.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   Right.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:35.980]   Yeah, I mean, I wrote another post this last week trying to rethink copyright.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   Not that this is the first one doing that.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.980]   There's millions of people trying to rethink it.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.980]   But it occurs to me that there's a notion of what I call credit,
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   the right to credit, the right to move things on.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   And that creates new models.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.980]   And so I saw a company I met a mission last week called Repost.us.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   Did I mention them?
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   That enables an article to become embeddable.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.980]   So that I wanted to build this because no one would build it,
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.980]   but luckily a long human company that did it.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   And it's really very cool that an article could travel and be embedded
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.980]   like a YouTube video with brand advertising, your own advertising,
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.980]   the creators advertising, the creators analytics, and the creators links
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   associated with it.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.980]   So rather than trying to get everybody to come to your site,
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   which is the old media model, now you can go to where the readers are.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   And what that has embedded in it is the business model that says,
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.980]   yeah, you need advertising and analytics to travel with your content.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.980]   If it's going to travel anyway, let's take advantage of that and leap on top of it.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:34.980]   So I argue that yes, the creator has some rights to create those rules
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.980]   by which this can happen.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.980]   So is Twitter right to say we think these buttons have to travel
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   with the stuff that we've created?
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:42.980]   Okay.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.980]   The only thing that he has about there is not one shred of content
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   was on Twitter was made by Twitter.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.980]   It was made by its users.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.980]   And so we asked you, is it a democracy or not?
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.980]   No, it's not.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.980]   But it should act a little bit more like one with an acknowledgement
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   that if we left tomorrow, and this is why Google says,
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.980]   don't be evil, not because they're virtuous, but because being evil
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   is really bad business now.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.980]   Is this evil?
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.980]   No, I think it wheezily is as high as I'll go.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:14.980]   Okay.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.980]   Evil would be saying to Justin Bieber, hey, we can't afford you
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.980]   because we have to do it at five extra servers just for your content.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.980]   So could you rate limit your tweets?
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:29.980]   Or evil might be saying you can only have 1.5 million followers.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   Or we'll charge you from--
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.980]   Or we'll-- well, I don't know if that's evil, actually.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:34.980]   That might make more sense.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.980]   Maybe that's what's next.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.980]   I don't know.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.980]   Well, I guess that's what happened.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:38.980]   I would argue, yeah.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.980]   Crapy is saying you can only retrieve 3,200 of your own tweets
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.980]   from the service.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   Yeah, but has that slowed down growth of Twitter?
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   And that's been the case all along since almost the beginning.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.980]   Has that slowed down the growth of Twitter at all?
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980]   No.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.980]   No, if a platform doesn't adhere to certain principles,
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.980]   it does not necessarily slow down growth, right?
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.980]   If you make a great product, which Twitter has, you get huge adoption,
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.980]   which they have, you know?
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.980]   Twitter's looking at the number of people they have on Twitter,
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   and they're saying we're doing everything right.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.980]   Now we just need to figure out a way to make money.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.980]   On the question of how tweets are displayed, you know, it's interesting,
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:17.980]   Jeff, like you're saying, this is our content, so Twitter shouldn't dictate
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.980]   the way that tweets are displayed.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.980]   But if apps, I mean, who should decide how tweets are displayed at makers?
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.980]   Right.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.980]   I mean, because...
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   Exactly the right question, Gina.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.980]   All I'm saying is that, yes, Twitter does have a right to say this,
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   but it's not an exclusive right.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:38.980]   It's not a right that goes beyond the interests of its users.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.980]   And so if there are apps that come down the path that I, as a user,
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.980]   would like to exist, we users would like to exist, but they now can't,
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   because Twitter exclusively said, no, you can't do that.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:53.980]   The reasons that they have, that's weasily behavior to its users,
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.980]   seed rule number one, a platform is its users.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.980]   And the end of the day, a platform without users is not a platform.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980]   Right.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980]   Right.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980]   It's a platform for users now.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   Thank you app developers.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980]   It's not a platform for you.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.980]   The user, but what does Twitter become?
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.980]   Twitter became what Twitter became because developers...
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:10.980]   Yeah, but it's time.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.980]   And it's...
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.980]   And that's the real question, Leo.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:13.980]   Is it done?
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.980]   Is Twitter...
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.980]   Is Twitter...
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.980]   Is Twitter baked now?
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.980]   It's baked.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.980]   Yes, it's baked.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980]   You see it's hash.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   You see Twitter hashtags on every television show.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.980]   It's done.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980]   Thank you.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980]   We'll take it from here.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.980]   I admit, you know, it's, I believe in you dance with the one that brung you,
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.980]   but I can understand why they might say, you know, we've got investors.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:42.980]   The ones that brung them are the people that put $150 million into Twitter's
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.980]   infrastructure.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.980]   That's what made Yahoo.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.980]   Yahoo thought it was baked.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.980]   Google never can be baked.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   Ah, interesting.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   I'll tell you, the couple apps that I'm really concerned about,
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   given these guidelines, TimeHop.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   You guys have used TimeHop?
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.980]   I think we've talked about it here.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.980]   Ase TimeHop.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.980]   I love it.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   Yes, they email you a year ago, Tweets.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.980]   They're not going to be able to do it.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.980]   Yeah, I mean, well, they just...
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:04.980]   They...
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980]   Even if they comply with the display requirements,
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.980]   they just add a new feature where you can comment on and ask somebody,
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.980]   like, "So if I get your year ago tweet, I can ask for an explanation."
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   Like, "Hey, Twit, I'm just gonna..."
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.980]   That's cool.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.980]   Like, what did this mean?
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.980]   But that's a comment on another service, you know, a third party service.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.980]   So I'm worried about that one, and I'm worried about Stellar,
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:28.980]   Stellar.io, which Jason Kaki makes, which is kind of like a list of all your
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.980]   friends' favorite tweets.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   It's awesome.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.980]   There's always great content there, and it's favorites across several networks,
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980]   Flickr, YouTube, et cetera.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.980]   But Jason's a designer, and he put a lot of thought and work into making tweets,
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.980]   you know, to making the reading experience really nice and being really minimal
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.980]   about what meta information it shows, you know, he shows in every tweet.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.980]   And for him to comply with the display requirements,
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.980]   it's gonna add all the little... the Twitter glitter, you know, the retweet button,
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.980]   the reply button, the favorite button, the avatar and all that.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.980]   So I'm concerned.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   I want to be clear with everyone that I am concerned about these changes,
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   and I think it's gonna, you know, affect some apps that are even not
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   traditional Twitter clients badly.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.980]   And I'm really hoping that Twitter is gonna take that Facebook approach
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.980]   of like break things and then kind of, you know, break things fast and then fix them later.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:17.980]   I'm hoping that Twitter is going to iterate on these changes and maybe clarify some
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:22.980]   of the guidelines or requirements and maybe be a little more lenient than the worst
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   interpretation, and that's just a hope.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:28.980]   And we're gonna see this changes roll out in the next few weeks, the coming weeks.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   You know, I... I... I... I... I made a mistake before.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:37.980]   I made a mistake before thinking that Twitter took a wrong turn when it took right turns.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.980]   And I'm not saying that these are absolutely wrong terms.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.980]   I may not understand.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.980]   So the problem here may be a problem of communication and transparency,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   or it may be a problem of culture and substance.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.980]   I don't know yet, but I... but I want to know.
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   I'm just sad 'cause, uh...
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.980]   Besides using ThinkUp to archive my tweets, I've been using a WordPress plugin for years,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.980]   uh... that automatically archives my tweets, and I put up...
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.980]   There's a blog post every week.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.980]   I don't think anybody ever reads it 'cause there's never any comments on it.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.980]   But on my blog, there's a post every Sunday night, uh... of my Twitter updates for the week,
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:16.980]   and it's... it's as much for me to be able to look back at that week, you know, 10 years from now
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.980]   'cause Twitter's not gonna let me do that.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.980]   So these are all archived.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:23.980]   I... I mean, I don't think Twitter's gonna notice this plugin, but if they do,
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.980]   this is clearly a violation of their, uh... right?
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.980]   'Cause it's...
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.980]   Yeah, that definitely... those don't... don't comply with it.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   There's no reply. There's no tweet.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   Yeah, I mean, this is the pure case of this being your content.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   It's my content being archived from Twitter.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   Absolutely.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:38.980]   Absolutely.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.980]   You should be able to display your tweets on your blog however you want.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:42.980]   In any way you want.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.980]   Yeah, I wrote it.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:44.980]   Mm-hmm.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:50.980]   Um... so I guess, uh... if there were a lot of people like me who really thought that was important,
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:54.980]   that could hurt Twitter, but I suspect that that's not... that... that's not the case.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.980]   It's just a...
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.980]   That goes into reading Twitter's T.O.S. because are you granting Twitter
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.980]   a non-exclusive license of that content, in which case you were just exercising
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.980]   your own use of your content?
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.980]   Well, and this is what I've always said, is that it... for years,
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.980]   that's why I keep quitting Twitter.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.980]   I am number one Twitter, as I have been for years, in fact,
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   we were going over on app.net.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:23.980]   All of the places that I have left Twitter for, starting with Jaikou, remember that?
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   And counts, and plurk, and buzz,
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   and I can go on and on.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.980]   I... because I want somewhere that will treat my... and status net, or identical,
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   I want somewhere that will tweet my content as my content.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:43.980]   Someone in a simple pandas says, "Don't forget spallink."
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   Is that an actual link?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980]   So I don't think there's a spank.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:46.980]   Okay.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.980]   There could be, I don't know.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980]   Um... I like Jaikou.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.980]   You know, Ja... I really, really... Google bottom put them out of their misery.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.980]   I guess you can open source the code, though.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.980]   The code's open source.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.980]   You could make your own Jaikou server.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.980]   Because it had threaded... it was everything Twitter wasn't.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.980]   But it didn't make it, and that's really the bottom line.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.980]   Now, was it the developers that made... I guess it was.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.980]   It was developer ecosystem that made Twitter Twitter.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.980]   Why didn't Pounce succeed? Pounce was great.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.980]   Why didn't Jaikou succeed?
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.980]   Was it because they came after Twitter?
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.980]   Maybe the network effect, right?
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.980]   Mm-hmm.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.980]   It was all critical mass.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.980]   And when you hit critical mass, then the rules change.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:35.980]   Twitter... something changed on Twitter when Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber,
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.980]   when the celebrities discovered it, that was the... that was when they turned the corner, right?
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   Britney Spears.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.980]   Yeah, I mean, that was... that was the big part of it, I think.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.980]   And that, to me, was the first reason to get the hell out of there.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.980]   As soon as Ashton Kutcher was there, it's like, "I don't want to be here."
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.980]   Unfortunately, that's where everybody is.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.980]   I don't know. It's fascinating.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   I like App.net.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.980]   I don't think App.net's going to make a difference.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:03.980]   No.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.980]   But I really like where Jeff is getting... where Jeff is... what Jeff is poking at right now,
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.980]   which is like, what makes a platform a platform?
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.980]   Right.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.980]   What should the principles of a platform be?
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:18.980]   What things out there really are platforms or what are just kind of...
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.980]   And I don't know.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980]   Media companies.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:21.980]   Yeah, I know you don't know.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.980]   But that's what I like about this is that you're...
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.980]   That's what this show is kind of about, really, right?
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   Right.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.980]   Cloud is really possible because platforms is a platform's networks.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.980]   The way I draw the world now on the whiteboard is that you have vertically integrated industries
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.980]   that are now replaced by three levels.
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:39.980]   Platforms, entrepreneurial efforts that can start now because those platforms exist
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.980]   and then networks that are necessary oftentimes to bring those entrepreneurial efforts
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.980]   to critical mass for things like purchasing your audience.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.980]   And the network really is just a special case of platform.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.980]   Right.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.980]   It really... that's true.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   And value today falls to the platforms because that's... that's who has it together.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.980]   So Google and Twitter and so on.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   I think it starts to shift over time.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:04.980]   So I've been arguing that newspapers should think of themselves as platforms for their communities.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.980]   Universities should think of themselves as platforms for students,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.980]   futures and education.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.980]   Governments should be platforms to more rarely if he shows up.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:12.980]   We'll probably talk about that.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:13.980]   That's what he...
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.980]   What government 2.0 is all about.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.980]   So in that case, it means... and people like Yochai Bekler who do brilliant work about networks
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   and what networks are.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.980]   But I think the network kind of exists in an ecosystem on its own.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   They form like atoms and molecules.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   A platform is an explicit act to create something that people use and thus depend upon to build something.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.980]   Respond, benefits come from that.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.980]   Huge benefits flow.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.980]   If you become a platform that makes critical mass, you get huge benefit once you figure out your business model.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.980]   But responsibilities also flow.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.980]   So that's what I'm trying to get at, Gina, is I'm trying to understand what we should expect those responsibilities to be.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.980]   And can we ever depend upon them?
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   Or, you know, Siva, but nothing and I will argue about whether Google has to be evil because it's a company.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.980]   I don't think all companies have to be evil.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.980]   I think today, you know, it's bad business to be evil.
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.980]   But maybe platform... maybe we can't depend on platforms.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:09.980]   Maybe it's fools, Marin, to ever depend on platforms because they must be what they must be, which is companies, and they will change.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   Unless they're open source, which is why I like open source.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.980]   Which is... which is... okay, so if you can build, so then the other question that came about Twitter,
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.980]   could you really... and I forget who wrote about this, so I apologize for not citing,
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.980]   but someone not me wrote that, okay, smartasses, you think you want a Twitter to be federated,
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.980]   but what if the tweets ended up coming, you know, ten minutes or ten days later?
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   You know, you have a high...
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.980]   Worthless.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:34.980]   You have a low tolerance for...
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:35.980]   Worthless, yeah.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.980]   Yeah, and so you... and witness the fail-well.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.980]   So... so you want a company to run this.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:44.980]   Once a company runs it, folks, and the rules change again.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.980]   I think some of this comes down to your definition of platform, and this is what I was trying to get at was...
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.980]   the traditional definition of platform is an operating system is a platform.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:15:01.980]   Microsoft created... in fact, you could really say that Microsoft created the platform that powered the personal computer industry for many, many years
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:09.980]   because it provided a reliable, stable, API, and service platform for developers to use.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.980]   It was those apps on top of Microsoft Windows that made it all work.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:20.980]   That's... to my mind, that's one kind of platform, but I think we're seeing the emergence of a second kind of platform,
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.980]   and that's kind of the point I was making, which is Twitter was originally like Windows,
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:29.980]   that kind of a platform, a developer platform, but they quickly realized that really what they are is a platform for users,
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   a content platform.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.980]   And that's... I don't think the rules are the same for a newspaper as platform as they are for an operating system as platform.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.980]   I think the rules are different.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.980]   Well, yeah, but I go back to that notion of... Gina brought it up, you know, the RT.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   The fact that it was users were not developers, but they acted like developers.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:51.980]   They created a function through a... you know, they added... they added the API.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   They added a convention.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   And Gina, what do you think a platform is?
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:05.980]   Well, I mean, a platform enables users and enables people to get things done, right?
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.980]   So, you know, it's interesting.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   I mean, I think the question that you and Siva talked about is whether or not if a company is in charge of a platform,
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:12.980]   do the rules change?
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.980]   I mean, is Twitter's goal to be a platform?
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   Is Twitter's goal to stick around and provide a great service?
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.980]   You know, I mean, I think about the iOS App Store, right, as a platform.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   That's a platform for developers to sell their apps, and it's all... and it's Apple's rules.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   It's not an open deal.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   And this is the point Marco makes for a platform to be successful for developers and has to be consistent.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.980]   Yes, and that's what Twitter's not been.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:43.980]   You need... you know, Microsoft succeeds a platform, particularly Microsoft, because it never changed the API.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.980]   It never changed the rules. It was really consistent.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.980]   And you...
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   It controlled the rules, but you didn't have to...
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   But you didn't have to get approval.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   And I don't know if approval is a disadvantage or not.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:02.980]   I think as long as the environment is known and stable as it is with the App Platform on iOS,
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.980]   I don't think it's a matter... control is really the issue.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.980]   It's that we want to be... it has to be consistent.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:08.980]   That's what Marco was saying.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.980]   Right. He said, right, the consistency for it to mount.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:15.980]   He felt like if these changes are being launched now, what happens next year or the year after?
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.980]   Do we really think that the App Store has been totally consistent?
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:22.980]   I mean, there haven't been enough sort of App Store snafoos this whole time?
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   And then also it's just Apple's nature to be very controlling.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.980]   They're the whole widget company, right?
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.980]   I mean, Apple's never gonna build something on top of an open platform.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.980]   They want to control the whole experience top to bottom and be very successful, you know, doing that.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   And, you know, when they launched the iOS platform, they're also a multi-billion dollar company.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   Twitter was a tiny little startup and would have done anything to get anybody to use it,
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   including developers in the beginning.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.980]   And that's why they need an API that was totally insecure.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.980]   I mean, remember when you could pass your username and password along?
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   Access the API, and they did it just so easy for anybody.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   And that's why some developers loved it.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.980]   I mean, I think tons of web developers really caught their D-thon API development on the Twitter API
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:02.980]   because it was so easy.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   And so they went from very, very liberal to more restrictive, and people don't respond well to that, right?
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   But if you're Apple and you start very restrictive and you set the tone, this is what it is,
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   then, you know, you feel more secure.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.980]   You know, Marco obviously feels that Apple's been very consistent this whole time.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.980]   I don't know.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:22.980]   I mean, things change.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.980]   I feel that things have changed in the app store as well.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.980]   I mean, there's uncertainty about everything.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   Whenever you're building something on someone else's business or else's business, there's risk.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   I mean, there's risk when you cross the street, you know?
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.980]   But that's, again, this is why consistency is so important.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   You have to make, you know, so I don't think it's a problem.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   Jeff, you seem to think it was a problem if a platform's owned by a company.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   No, I don't think it was a problem.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.980]   I agree with Siva that it has to be because it has to be a dictate.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.980]   A platform is ultimately a dictatorship because otherwise it's inconsistent.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.980]   So it has to be absolutely consistent.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   But it's a collaborative.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.980]   But it's a mix, isn't it?
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:03.980]   You have to be, you have to provide a platform means stable.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.980]   I can build on this.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.980]   If it's a moving, shifting sand, it's not stable.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:09.980]   It's not a platform.
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.980]   A platform doesn't move.
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.980]   That means it's a dictatorship.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   Now you can do all sorts of loopy things on top of it.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.980]   But that platform, well, that's the, yeah, I mean, that's why I'm not going to do it.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   Yeah, I mean, that's why I think Microsoft is probably better at making platforms than
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.980]   Linux was.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:26.980]   And Apple too.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   But even Linux is somewhat of a dictatorship.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   And the Linus was smart enough to say it's not Linux unless I say it's Linux.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.980]   Oh, I mean, open source.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:39.980]   Yeah, the key part of successful open source projects is a benevolent dictator, but dictator indeed.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   And you know, Apple introduced the Mac App Store.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   I mean, I have to buy my apps through the Mac App Store a certain way.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:48.980]   And now they're building into OS 10 ways to say, oh, this app hasn't been verified.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:53.980]   I haven't installed the latest update yet, but, you know, it's differentiating between
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   official Apple apps and an Apple app, you know, apps that you just download off the web.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   I mean, they've gotten more restrictive over time as well.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:08.980]   I mean, I think there's just a lot of uncertainty around Twitter in general because people still don't understand how they're going to make money and what they really are.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:13.980]   And they don't, they're sort of indicating that they're not really sure what they are and their communications, as we said.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.980]   Which is OK.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   I mean, again, Google shifted.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.980]   I don't have any objection to that at all.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   People have joked about, and I've joked about the front Wilson's face about, you know, oh, Twitter now has a business model 10 times.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   I think everybody would understand that.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   Everyone would say, listen, this is the reality.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980]   This is the path we're taking.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   You may not like it.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   You may think advertising is corrupting or whatever, but it's the way we're going to go.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.980]   And I'm cool with that.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   I just think there's a cultural issue there of communication.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:46.980]   And it's all the worst when you hit that point of critical mass when you don't, you think you don't need your developers anymore.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:47.980]   That's what's weasily about it.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:52.980]   And if you say, no, we still do or we still do in some extent, but some cases we don't because we can't afford to.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.980]   And here's why.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.980]   Here's the reality we have.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.980]   I respected a lot more.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   Hey, that's fair.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.980]   I think a great conversation we're going to move on, but that was fun.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:10.980]   I think this is kind of really key, not just, it's not about Twitter at all.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   This is what this show was really about.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   When Gina said the rule day one is, Gina, as I understood, said to you, I'll be on it if it's not really a show about Google.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   It's a show about the cloud.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   And what it really is about is platforms and networks and all that.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.980]   The cloud is just one substantiation of it.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   And I think that the conversation about what a platform is.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   What a platform is, what the rights and responsibilities are of a platform maker is fundamental to everything we love in technology.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.980]   I don't care if it's an operating system or a semiconductor or any of that stuff.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:57.980]   Instagram, we haven't talked about that since we convened last week.
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   Are we in a bubble?
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:00.980]   $1 billion.
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:07.980]   Jeff Jarvis, why would Facebook pay $1 billion for an iPhone app?
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   Basically.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:09.980]   They've got it.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.980]   The arguments are many.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.980]   The arguments are many that they needed mobile.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   They needed better photo, that they needed the audience, that they were scared of it because they see themselves.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:27.980]   Facebook sees itself, I think perhaps too much as a photo service, but so much of their usage is photo and Instagram was better.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   As someone said in one of the clips of things today, $1 billion for crappy filters.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:39.980]   I'm not an Instagram fanatic at all.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.980]   I hardly use it ever.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.980]   See, I love Instagram.
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   I used it a lot.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.980]   When it first came out, I was a big early supporter of Instagram.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.980]   And that's what they purchased for $1 billion.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.980]   They purchased $30 million.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.980]   Yes, exactly.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.980]   I just wrote a column about this, which is going to go live any second now.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.980]   There are basically three things that Facebook got out of this that they didn't already have.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:13.980]   Don't tell me about users because most Instagram users also use Facebook and it's only 30-35 million people versus $800 million.
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.980]   They didn't buy users.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   They didn't really buy technology.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   There's no technology in Instagram that's worth the damn.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.980]   You can steal an app.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:28.980]   It's a pretty good design, but it's a free app with cheesy filters that's really easy to use and clean.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   But people love it.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.980]   They love love Instagram.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.980]   And people don't love Facebook.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   People love to use Facebook because the people that they love are on Facebook.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   But you'll never hear the phrase "Facebook fanboy."
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.980]   Nobody's a fan of Facebook.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.980]   No, that's true.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:51.980]   And big companies can't engineer affection unless you're Apple.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:24:03.980]   And so I think this is the beginning of a trend where companies will be purchased and highly valued because they've been able to engender super high user affinity.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.980]   And that's what Instagram is.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:14.980]   They're buying the love of 30-35 million people, but they're buying the ability to be lovable.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:20.980]   And I think a lot of the Instagram pixie dust is going to end up in their mobile apps.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.980]   And the hope is that it will make people love Facebook more.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.980]   So they're buying a soul.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.980]   This is from Paul of the Yorker piece.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   He said that basically Facebook is buying a soul.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:34.980]   The soul of a startup, a thing that people just love.
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:35.980]   Can you really buy that though?
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.980]   Don't you kill it when you buy it?
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   That's a good question, Leo.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   I tend to think, no, I mean, I saw a lot of people write a lot of pieces about how to export on Facebook.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:49.980]   Or how to export all your photos from Instagram and close your account once they heard about the Facebook acquisition.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.980]   But you know what, Gina, that's what got me pissed off.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   There's this digist snob movement that as soon as whole Facebook touches it, well, I'm going to kill it.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   You know, 845 million people against you.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.980]   I mean, how out of touch are you with what's going on?
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.980]   How uncurious are you about what the world is using?
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:17.980]   Kill it, kill it, I don't care. But to make this announcement that I'm going to unsubscribe to you or I'm going to kill this encounter, I'm going to do that.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.980]   I don't care.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:20.980]   The business is still growing.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.980]   It doesn't frankly need you.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.980]   If there's too many of you, that's true.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   But this idea that Facebook has kudos, I think it's kind of ridiculous.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   Facebook may well ruin it.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   You know, everything that AOL bought, everything that Yahoo bought got ruined.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   But Zuckerberg does do things differently.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:43.980]   And he said in his message, it was very important that he plans to keep this running independently.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.980]   He still wants it to be part of an ability in the ecosystem to send other services.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   I don't think this is the creation of a unified social network.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   I think it's the creation of the first social conglomerate.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:26:03.980]   Well, you note that he said that he would keep it running separately, but he didn't say that we're not going to make Facebook more like this also.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:04.980]   That's okay.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:16.980]   But back to the point, I think that you can actually purchase love like this because the reason people love Instagram is because of how it makes them feel.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.980]   People love their lives.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:22.980]   They love their cat, their friends, they see a sunset, they're inspired by it.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:23.980]   They want to share it.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:28.980]   It's a human impulse to want to share the things that you're inspired by.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.980]   And Instagram, let's say you go snap.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.980]   Make it a little arty. So I feel like I'm being expressive and creative, even though I'm not.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   And then click a button and everybody sees it.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   Yeah, Mike.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   But it feels really good to people.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   But okay.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.980]   But I think that love is hard to earn and easy to lose.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.980]   And I don't say that because of the kudi aspect.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:51.980]   Oh, Facebook touched it.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.980]   But look at Flickr.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.980]   I think people love Flickr.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.980]   Yahoo bought it.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   I still use Flickr.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.980]   I use Flickr a lot.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.980]   But Yahoo abandoned it.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.980]   So my love for Yahoo was diminished.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   I had not that I ever had any possible respect.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.980]   I had for Yahoo.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:12.980]   But that was diminished by their abandonment of Flickr and delicious worse.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:13.980]   Right.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.980]   So you can't buy it.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.980]   You can at most borrow it.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:25.980]   The other thing I think that I haven't heard very many people mention is that one reason
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.980]   to purchase Instagram is to prevent them from supporting Google+.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.980]   Because right now it supports everything but Google+ like a lot of things.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.980]   So buy them before there's a right API.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.980]   Exactly.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.980]   Because you know, I mean when you take a picture here we'll do this real quickly.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.980]   We'll take a picture of Gina because I think that's the best thing to take a picture of.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.980]   And then I will make it arty.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   I read somebody say that these filters make everything.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.980]   Look like it was taken in this app.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   Right.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   And now I can share Twitter, Facebook, email, Flickr, four square, Tumblr, Postrous.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:04.980]   Everything but.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:05.980]   Where's the Google?
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   Where's the Google?
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:13.980]   And yet, and a couple of things come to mind.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   First of all, I don't think that the naysayers are really important.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.980]   I mean, after all, when Android, when there was an Android version of Instagram, it was
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   probably the same people who said, "Ew, you got Android in my iPhone."
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:31.580]   So those people are probably just, you know, they're not going to make a big difference.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:39.860]   But I wonder, can you inject, you know, in some, now when they're making bio genetically
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:42.900]   enhanced products, they inject DNA.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:50.780]   Can you inject DNA from Facebook, or is, I think Facebook's a juggernaut.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.860]   I think there's only 30 people work at this, or 20 people that work at this company.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.340]   How is that going to change the monster that is Facebook?
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:05.380]   Well, to your point, how did the acquisition of Friend Feed change Facebook?
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   It didn't.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.580]   Does anybody remember Friend Feed?
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.780]   It was like the, remember it was the flavor of the month and then Facebook bought it and
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:11.780]   just kind of.
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:15.980]   And Brett Taylor, who came from Friend Feed, became Facebook's CTO.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.980]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:18.980]   Wasn't Friend Feed bought.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:19.980]   I thought Friend Feed was popping.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.700]   He was the walking dead at that point.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:22.940]   Yeah, they were bought for the people.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:30.340]   And this is, in fact, up till now, everything Facebook's done is in a choir, a choir.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   That doesn't work in audio.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.020]   It only works when you write it.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:38.940]   A, Q, H, I, R, E, where they would get, I'm thinking of Sam Lesson of Droppio, which was
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.340]   a great product.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.620]   And they killed it because all they really wanted was Sam.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.500]   Friend Feed was a dying product, but they really just wanted Paul and Mike, obviously,
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.060]   mostly we wanted Brett.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   This is going to be different, I think.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.260]   I think it's more like maps, isn't it?
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.620]   This is more like Google buying the folks who made--
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.900]   And making it a big part of Facebook.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.460]   Because you look what they did with Sam.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.820]   So I think Sam's a good example, right?
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:07.140]   So by hiring Sam, by buying his company, he became key to--
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   In a timeline.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.140]   In a timeline.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140]   In a timeline.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.140]   In a timeline.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:17.780]   And the best thing that can happen here is that, yes, Instagram can exist on its own,
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:18.780]   but I think you're right, Mike.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.340]   The point is that Facebook becomes more like Instagram rather than Instagram becomes like
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:23.340]   Facebook.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.340]   That's the point with--
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.220]   Those 20 people-- and it's really not 20.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.580]   It's really probably Kevin's sister and nobody else.
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:32.420]   If he can go in, I guess you Sam did.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.420]   Brent did.
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.420]   I guess you're right.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.420]   Kind of culture.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.380]   And they hired those other guys who were involved in timeline.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.220]   They went and hired the brightest they could.
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.500]   I think that's part of what Zuckerberg tries to do.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.220]   He walks them through the woods to convince them to come there.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:49.180]   Because it's part of the cult of Zuck.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.980]   And I think that that means to me.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.580]   That's part of what they pride themselves on Facebook.
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.980]   Because they're not to be heavith that Google has become.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.100]   Cult or not, if anybody offered me a billion dollars for anything.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:03.620]   Well, including my first born, I'd really consider it anyway.
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:04.620]   It's shit cleared.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.820]   Three days before this announcement, who got a piece of that billion dollars, who doubled
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.780]   their money in three days.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.780]   That's what's really absurd.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780]   Who the lottery man?
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.780]   You just kind of know where you're investing.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780]   That's all.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:19.340]   System, the founder got 400 million.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.900]   The investors of course made off like band, made out like bandits.
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.540]   And in fact, they had a hundred million dollar pool.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.980]   It's divided among the remaining employees.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.900]   So each of them is going to be a millionaire.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.860]   This is the thing about the acquisition announcement that made me kind of crazy.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.340]   Or this is the thing that fascinated me.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.060]   Or maybe galled me a little bit.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:41.260]   It's like, 20 year old guy gets a one billion dollar exit.
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.580]   It has such a huge impact on the technology community, the tech media.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.540]   And then I think the startup community, because suddenly the whole conversation becomes about
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:51.540]   how can I get my bill?
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.900]   You know, who had the most spectacular exit?
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:57.980]   There's all this like weird jealousy and there's kind of the, you know, the Facebook
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.980]   backlash.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.500]   And then, you know, I just think you have a lot of young people who are trying to make
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.900]   good products on the web, which is what we're all supposed to be trying to do, not trying
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:07.700]   to have the most spectacular billion dollar exit possible.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.700]   Kind of get distracted.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.700]   It is distracting.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   I think you're way right.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.340]   I think you're way right.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.980]   And I think that this creates a 1% of the technology world.
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:19.540]   Yes, it does.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.140]   Right.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.260]   And that's part of the problem where we are now.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.180]   And it skews the ethical view of it.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.460]   If it's skewed banking, it's going to skew geeks too.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.420]   And it's worrisome that that's where we are.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:35.060]   Now, you know, I don't, I don't begrudge them getting the money they can get.
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.060]   God bless them.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.060]   But you're right.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.300]   What does it do to the rest of the world around them?
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:44.700]   Yeah, there's this very small contingent of young men, young white men who have a lot
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.740]   of money because they had, you know, they won this lottery.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.980]   And you know, and like you said, good for them.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:54.260]   It just, it makes me sad that this, that the, the, the conversation about web product development,
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:57.980]   you know, becomes about the exit and not, and not about, you know, making something really
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.980]   good.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:02.060]   I think it's been going on since 1994 and that's Cape.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   Absolutely.
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:06.180]   I mean, this is, this is frankly always the undercurrent in Silicon Valley is.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.620]   And, and I actually like this.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:13.660]   I like this trend because essentially a years ago, if you're a young entrepreneur, you,
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:19.540]   you wanted to go for that big payoff either by becoming a company with a lot of revenue
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.300]   or by selling to a larger company.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:22.300]   That's always been the case.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:26.620]   But in the past, you had to always demonstrate, well, not in the past since the crash of 2000,
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:31.260]   you had to demonstrate that you had a, you know, a business, the business plan.
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.260]   This is the revenue model.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.180]   This is how we can make money.
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.700]   And these guys never got around to that part of it.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.700]   They just created it.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.700]   They didn't have to free it.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.700]   That everybody loved.
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:43.900]   And I would love to see everybody focused on creating things that everybody loves and
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.860]   stop trying to figure out how we could.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:48.020]   Oh, I think sustainability matters.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:51.940]   I see that disease in journalism and news and media where people say, I just want to
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.940]   do what's cool and neat.
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.340]   And they don't put any thought and sustainability.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:57.700]   And so then what happens, this is where the true bubble comes in.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.700]   Then they say, well, okay, I'll get bought.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:03.580]   They won't give me any thought to it, which is really just a bad way to create a feature.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.580]   There's no real.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:07.260]   But isn't that what it is?
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.260]   Yeah, it is.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.260]   But here's the issue.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:14.700]   What we should be critical of is not the makers of, I think, Instagram, which would
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:19.460]   be critical of Facebook, that they have a structure that meant that rather than developing
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:23.260]   something cool and nice in-house, they had to go buy for a billion dollars a month.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.340]   The other thing is, I really want to go back to what Gina says.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:30.700]   I think it's important that we have to look at the future financial structure of our world.
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:35.860]   And I've argued, and I argued this in a post about the jobs bill, not jobs, but J-O-B-S,
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:39.900]   the investment, which I'll talk about in a second, that we're moving from a world of
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:45.020]   vertical industries fully owned where you control product creation, manufacturing, marketing
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:47.060]   and distribution to a world of ecosystems.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:49.380]   And the ecosystem that I say that there are three layers.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.780]   There's a platform layer.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:54.060]   There's an entrepreneurial layer now made possible by the platform they were existing.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:57.700]   And there's a network layer that is often necessary to get those small entrepreneurial
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.540]   ventures to critical mass.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:04.300]   What's happening in our world today is all the value is falling to the platform.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:07.940]   That's why Google was worth so much in Facebook and so on and Zinga.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.220]   The entrepreneurial layer is possible to do because those platforms exist, but you're
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.220]   small.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.860]   You're inevitably small until maybe you get in a network like Glam.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:19.060]   What I like about the jobs bill, apart from taking away regulation that we probably still
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:23.540]   do need on companies because companies and Wall Street are all screwed up, but the idea
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:28.380]   of being able to get funding to new ventures on their own now, easier than going through
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:33.260]   venture capital from crowdfunding and the idea of being able to exit without having
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:39.060]   to sell out for a billion dollars or go IPO and you can get earlier exits and get some
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:40.060]   value out of this.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:44.940]   I hope drives some value back up to the entrepreneurial layer, which is the one that Gina really
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.260]   loves and I love and that we want to encourage.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:53.500]   If the only way we encourage that is the absolute long shot blockbuster economy, it
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.660]   becomes like Hollywood.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.980]   A few people will make the movie this exceeds and the rest will starve.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.980]   We don't want that.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.940]   We want to Graham did it.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:02.940]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.820]   I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jeff.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.900]   Instagram did everything right and it's great that they're being rewarded.
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.820]   They have a very lean operation.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.740]   I understand that.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   But we want to resist that.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740]   Gina, I think Gina, right?
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:14.900]   You're not criticizing them.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.740]   You're criticizing the structure that this is leading to.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:22.820]   But the billion dollar, the unusual billion dollar purchase price, the unex, radically
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.220]   unexpected is a reward for having done everything right.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:31.660]   If this had never happened, Instagram would have still been very, very successful.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:33.660]   There's 10 ways they could have been very successful.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.380]   Yeah, but I don't think that's the only gauge.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:40.180]   You can also be Mark Cuban who basically did nothing and got a huge amount of money from
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:45.540]   a very stupid company that in turn then turned around what they bought for $5 billion.
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:48.900]   The fact that you've got a lot of money is not necessarily the reward or quality.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.740]   What Gina, I think is going to, and I want to hear back from Gina, is that I think that
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:56.660]   there's an ethic that you want to see rewarded, right Gina?
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   Yes.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.700]   And it's got to be more than just why made something nice.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:04.820]   It's got to be that I can have a sustainable business out of this.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.300]   I can raise funds to do it.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.940]   I can take some money off the table to buy my house.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.940]   I can make something good and be good and have a business.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:15.380]   And we want lots of that happening rather than a few blockbusters.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.380]   Gina, I'm sorry.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.460]   Yeah, I mean, my last bit to New York, I visited a startup.
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.260]   I won't say which one, but it's been in business for almost 10 years.
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.740]   It's profitable, doing great.
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:28.820]   And the founder said to me, "Well, I feel just so old and slow when you look at things
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:34.900]   like Zingad and I bet now, OMG Pop and I bet now he'd say Instagram."
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:36.380]   And it was like, "Wait a second.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:41.340]   10 years in business with a profitable internet business, media company and the internet,
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:42.340]   that's something to be proud of.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.340]   That's something to celebrate.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.780]   I only hope that 10 years, my company will still be around and I'll still be passionate
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.340]   about it and I'll still be doing meaningful, interesting things on the web.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.740]   And I will have made something that people love.
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:55.660]   Listen, Instagram is an awesome app.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.660]   I loved it.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:59.340]   They made an incredible product experience.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.940]   Those guys did a great job and good for them and they're billion dollars.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:06.940]   It just, it makes me sad that it kind of sets up this goal or this standard that people
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:13.500]   are like, "Well, if I don't build this blockbuster product in two years by the time I'm 26 and
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.860]   sell out for a billion dollars, then I failed."
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.860]   Well, they should.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:17.860]   Good.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.500]   Listen to Gina entrepreneurs.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500]   You haven't failed.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.140]   Well, you know, you built something good and you know what?
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:32.380]   Most people, like 99.9% will never have a big payday like Kevin's sister mad.
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:33.380]   This is really an outlier.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.380]   But, but without the goal, Leo, that's the wrong thing.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.620]   It can be the goal and you know why it's good because what it does is it gets everybody
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.020]   on page mill road to start putting money into lots of little startups.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:51.820]   Okay, but that's part of the issue is that they expect that kind of, their definition
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.460]   of failure is not the definition.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:39:00.260]   They know that it's a long shot, but it means there's more money to invest because there's
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.660]   more money to be made.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.940]   Most entrepreneurs are like me where I'm just going to be happy if I could survive a year
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.180]   or two and make a profitable business.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:09.420]   That's the way most people think.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.700]   I don't think it's going to change how people feel.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.180]   I'm going to go walk you for a second.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.700]   I read a great book I just blogged about called the institutional revolution.
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:17.900]   It's pretty wonky.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:23.100]   No Gutenberg in it, but it tries from an economics perspective to explain why there were these
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:29.340]   ridiculous institutions in pre-modern England of the aristocracy and bought army commissions
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.100]   and doolene and private roads.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.820]   And really interesting analysis that said before you could measure performance, you had
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:37.260]   to get trust in other means.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.620]   You got means and things like he calls a hostage capital.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:47.060]   You sent your daughter to the court and if you screwed up, you couldn't see her again.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:51.620]   You made a huge estate because you invested in that.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.900]   Point is, then other means came along to measure.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:57.940]   People could find longitude and latitude.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.020]   We had clocks that worked.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.020]   We had measurements.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.540]   You could measure success in new ways.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.460]   And so the institutions changed.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:07.340]   What Gina's talking about here really I think is that we are creating the new institutions
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.340]   of society.
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:13.060]   The technology industry is creating new institutions and how they operate under what ethics and
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.460]   mores and with what goals.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:21.260]   We have to stand back and say if a billion dollars becomes the goal, again, God bless
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.420]   Facebook and God bless Instagram, not complaining about them.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.580]   What are we building?
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.980]   What's the society we're building?
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:34.420]   We wanted to build a society where all of the above is celebrated and possible and common.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:36.740]   And in fact, that's exactly what we have.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.940]   That's in lots of small entrepreneurs and technology are building companies and making
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:44.180]   going concerns of it and doing very well and it's fantastic.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:49.060]   The thing that excites me about these big, splashy billion dollar payoffs is it's something
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:53.020]   that inspires high school students to want to become entrepreneurs.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:57.460]   Because starting a little company and making a nice profit off in the corner doing something
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:00.300]   is awesome.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.860]   And there's so few that everybody's tried to do.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.860]   That's like saying.
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.860]   That's like saying like it's just.
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:09.660]   How many how many it's the lottery people buy lottery tickets, Omega millions tickets,
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.820]   everybody even even my smart employees.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.660]   That is a terrible.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:14.660]   I agree.
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:16.740]   But but but look it.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:21.460]   I think both entrepreneurs and investors know that this is an outlier.
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:25.780]   It's the outlier that makes people feel good and say, gee, we could buy it, you know, like
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.900]   win the lottery ticket.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.740]   And I don't think I don't see any real harm done here.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:36.020]   So you're making the basketball in the ghetto argument, which is that very few can make
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:39.420]   a pro teams, but if many hope to, then it's good.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:42.900]   Well, well, in fact, the reality is that a lot of young people think the only way to
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:48.540]   make it in the world that they either have to become a superstar, singer, rap, rap, singer
[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.060]   or Beyonce or something like that, or they have to become a major sports person or they
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:55.500]   have to be famous or nothing.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.980]   It doesn't take no, but we're dealing with a smart class of each.
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:41:59.980]   Wait a minute.
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.540]   The tech community is smart.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.660]   They're not stupid.
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.740]   They know that this is an outlier.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:07.060]   They're not they understand what Gene is saying.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.060]   You should build a company.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.060]   You should build value.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.060]   You should do.
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.220]   You're giving them no credit.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:12.220]   They're not they're smart.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:15.420]   They know this isn't they're not going to get a billion dollars.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:16.580]   That might happen.
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:20.220]   It gives them a little hope, a little something to dream about, but almost everybody who starts
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:25.500]   a company I would guarantee you is just trying to make something good and and make something
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.540]   that last make something profitable.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:33.100]   Yes, we all think about our big exit, but that doesn't change how you do things.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:34.100]   Does it?
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:36.260]   I mean, I think you still try to add value.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:37.700]   I hope so.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.740]   I hope that young entrepreneurs are not aiming for the hockey stick big exit.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:42.740]   You know, crazy.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.780]   I hope that people want to build businesses that last.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.940]   I just think that stories like this, they get the amount of hack that they do and you
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:49.940]   know, it's a billion dollars.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:50.940]   It's a big number.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:51.940]   I understand.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.940]   I'm not blaming the media.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.660]   I just it seemed like a really big distraction.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:58.620]   I mean, at one point, I had the closed winner because I just couldn't, you know, the joking,
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:02.620]   the sarding, the commentary, the opinions, the, you know, it gets a lot of attention
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.620]   when that number.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   It gets a lot of attention.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.980]   By the way, if it had been 900 million, it wouldn't have gotten that much attention.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:08.980]   It would not.
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.180]   It's one billion that makes such a big deal.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.180]   It is.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:15.100]   And you know, and my fantasy and I have no idea how this actually happened, but my fantasy
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.900]   is this that Facebook went to Instagram and said, okay, we want to buy you from this
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:20.100]   much Instagram said no way.
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.340]   And they said, we want to buy you from this much Instagram said no way.
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:23.540]   You cannot afford us.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.940]   We care about our product too much.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.420]   And it got up to a billion dollars, right?
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.340]   Like everybody has their price and it makes me really happy that Instagram's price is a
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.340]   billion dollars.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.340]   That's exactly what happened.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.340]   That's the price we sell.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.340]   That makes me happy, right?
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:37.860]   Because they, you know, they're, they're last round.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.900]   They were valued at a hundred million.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:44.540]   Some, some wild crazy people a few months ago said 500 million.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:45.700]   It's based on the last round.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.540]   I think the last round was valued at that.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:52.420]   It's clearly more than, than you would normally, you, you're not going to say, I'll
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:53.700]   take a billion dollars.
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.700]   You might say it in jest.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.420]   And then when Mark Zuckerberg says, okay.
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.740]   And who's going to go home then and say, uh, honey, I'm proud of myself.
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.540]   I turned down a billion dollars today.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:06.540]   You want to have a moon?
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.740]   That's grounds for divorce.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:12.780]   And now I'm going to get Jeff wired up around up here because it's with, at a billion dollars,
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.820]   it's worth $50 million more than the New York Times.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.820]   Yes.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:22.540]   The New York Times market cap is 950 million dollars.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:28.940]   The 551 day old company is worth more than 100 plus for all users.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.740]   No, you're right.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:34.020]   30 million is more than whatever than one or two million that read the New York Times.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.820]   I would argue, no, they have a large online audience.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.820]   That's true online speaker.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:41.980]   They actually do have, they probably have about, they'll probably have more than 30 billion.
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:50.780]   And you know what we don't know, this could be a broadcast.com moment.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:56.700]   We could, we could be watching Kevin's system and the port, you know, jumping onto the, the
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:45:01.820]   floor at the Portland Trailblazers game, making an ass of himself, spending his money, like
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:08.060]   Mark Cuban, uh, in 10 years and everybody'll go, remember, yeah, remember when Facebook
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:12.060]   bought what was the name of his company for like all that money, whatever happened to
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060]   that.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:14.060]   I'm talking about Instagram.
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:15.300]   I'm saying 10 years from now.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.300]   Oh, right.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.300]   Right.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.300]   Facebook bought, what was that?
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.100]   It was a film, you'll be on the stars.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.620]   I'll tell you who's really feeling bad right now.
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:27.740]   Do you remember a company called text America?
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:31.900]   It was a moblogging company had a lot of attention about eight years ago.
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900]   We were all doing it.
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.100]   We were all taking pictures on our, on our cell phones and putting one text.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.300]   It was Instagram.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.580]   It just was a little too early and they could make it.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.340]   How do you think it's dramatic feels?
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:45.340]   There you go.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.340]   Well, a lot of this is timing, right?
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.340]   Timing connections.
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:51.940]   I mean, it's talent, but then there's a lot of other factors, but, but, but they tried
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:52.940]   to monetize.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:53.940]   Right.
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.100]   That was their mistake.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:02.500]   So, uh, no, no, too early, too early, not, nothing wrong with monetization, but they
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.220]   clearly build, build quality first, worry about monetization later.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.780]   That's actually okay, Gina, because that fits your model because they're, they're, they're
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.740]   not trying to say, let's, let's, let's make money right away.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.180]   Let's build a great product first.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.980]   Let's build a great community first.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:17.980]   Okay.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.780]   As long as we can survive, let's build a great community.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.580]   And they were, they were frugal about it.
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:23.580]   That's, that's the thing.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:25.580]   It's underappreciated.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:26.580]   For a long time, Instagram was just those two guys.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.580]   I remember we interviewed him.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:32.660]   We interviewed Kevin and we said, where's the Android product?
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.660]   This was a year ago.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:36.860]   And he said, it's just the two of us, you know, we don't have time.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:37.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:38.860]   We were just two of us.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.660]   Well, my son, my Jake, Jake, Jake, we're going to be doing it.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:46.180]   Jake thought that actually the, the among his, some of his friends, my son, Jake, that
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:50.620]   people were upset about the Android coming up because part of the allure of Instagram
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:53.780]   was that you had to have an iPhone to have it.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.780]   Absolutely.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.020]   And that was part of what made it limited and special.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.580]   That's why I was sexy.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:05.500]   So, um, patty power, who was apparently a very well-known Irish bookie is taking odds
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:10.780]   on Facebook's next acquisition and four-squares leading with four to one odds.
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:17.060]   The long odds, my space YouTube is 40 to one.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   Friends reunited.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.220]   I mean, it's an English, you know, it's English.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.460]   So same thing with a couple of these.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.860]   That's the Real Classmates.com.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:27.060]   Tumblr 25 to one Spotify 7 to one.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:29.060]   I think Spotify should be higher.
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.980]   I disagree with ever not being on that list.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.460]   I don't think they're going to go for it.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.460]   No, we're not.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:34.460]   9 to 2.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.460]   I agree.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.300]   I tell us the name of that book because you just held it up so people on video saw it,
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.300]   but we didn't hear it.
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:41.300]   Oh, sorry.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:43.820]   It's called the Institutional Revolution by Douglas Allen.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:45.380]   It's pretty walky, folks.
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:46.700]   And I've blogged about it.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:47.700]   And no Gutenberg.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.940]   You know, if any good Gutenberg book.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:51.620]   Yeah, it would be a good book about Gutenberg.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:57.180]   The best Gutenberg, the authoritative one that's out of print is by Albert Capar, K-A-P-A-P-R.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.020]   You tried, Mike.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:00.020]   You tried.
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.660]   You did your best.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:02.660]   Oh.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:06.540]   It's called Gutenberg the Geek, and it's only 99 cents.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.980]   99 cents.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.980]   You tried, Mike.
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:10.980]   I walked out.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:14.460]   But while we're at it, if you're really into Gutenberg after having read my thing, you want
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:15.460]   to read something really good.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.220]   John Mann's Gutenberg biography is very good.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.220]   I will read that.
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.220]   I will read that.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:21.220]   I love it.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.220]   Facebook's never going to try.
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.220]   He's never going to try.
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:27.060]   No, this is why we love Jeff.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.220]   Well, actually, the best Gutenberg book would be...
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.460]   I'm glad you asked.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.460]   All right, busted.
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:40.660]   They only have people I want on Twitter on any of our shows or people like that.
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:45.580]   No, nothing about promotions or marketing.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.420]   We just want to inform.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.420]   That's all.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:50.420]   We're just here to Santa Claus.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:51.420]   Go to gimbals.
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.420]   Exactly.
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:49:02.420]   I also hear Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor from the city of New York.
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:06.700]   The University of New York and the author of Public Parts, his newest book.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.020]   And in my hair, I'm always appearing in black and white.
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:13.140]   You know, you look good in black and white, actually.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:17.140]   Also Matt Cutz is here from Google, one of Google's earliest employees.
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.740]   He works in the spam fighting division at Google and a good person to have on today.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:23.740]   Hello, Matt.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:24.740]   Hey, good to be here.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.740]   Thanks for having me.
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:26.740]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:28.420]   He's trying to turn off the logo to the turn off your lightsmith.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.220]   It's a dark day today.
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.220]   That's fine.
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:37.820]   Those of you who are just tuning in or downloading the video might be slapping your computer or
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.820]   your television set.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:40.980]   No, there's nothing wrong with your set.
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:47.220]   We are in black and white today because we're recording this on January 18th, which is the
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:49.060]   day the internet fought back.
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:53.380]   And with some success, I might add, we just learned we just talked to an activist at the
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:58.820]   Electronic Frontier Foundation that today alone, 29 members of Congress, have reversed
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.860]   their position on the internet.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:05.140]   But I'm Kevin Purdy, and I thank you for joining us.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.140]   Thank you.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:07.140]   I wasn't quite the engineer.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.060]   I just rolled with it.
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.580]   I like the black and white, actually.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.100]   I think that looks kind of good.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.100]   There's something about it.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.100]   Classy.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:21.780]   So if you go to google.com, there's a nice big, it looks like a piece of duct tape over
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:24.380]   the logo and a link.
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:28.220]   Tell Congress, please don't censor the web and look at this.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:30.660]   Nearly four million people.
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:33.940]   Today, signing that petition.
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:37.700]   Let me just do that right now so that I can make it four million and one.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:40.860]   I encourage everybody while you're watching the show to do that.
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:44.060]   Matt Cutz, why doesn't Google want to stop piracy?
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.660]   Are you pro piracy, Matt Cutz?
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:47.660]   Of course not.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:52.860]   No, we hate piracy and we actually spend, you know, like $60 million a year trying to get
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:55.780]   bad ads and other things out of our system.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:01.700]   So nobody wants piracy, but it's pretty crazy when you're trying to solve a business model
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:05.260]   problem with a technological solution that just won't even work.
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:08.900]   And I think that's one of the big things is people don't realize that pirates will just
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.740]   quickly get around this.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:15.140]   And in the meantime, it will absolutely, of course, her jobs, but basically put a chilling
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:18.900]   effect on the internet where a lot of people, a lot of sites that rely on user-generated
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:22.700]   content will be incredibly affected by it.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:26.300]   My wife, I sent her an email and I was like, "Hey, would you mind calling a senator?"
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.060]   And she's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, I should."
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.460]   And then she went to Craftzine, which is an O'Reilly site.
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:32.740]   And it was shut down for the day.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:35.260]   And she's like, "Oh, no, that's right.
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.380]   Regular sites are going to be affected."
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:38.900]   And that was what the tipping point for her to call her senator.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:40.860]   Yeah, I care a lot about this.
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:45.980]   Our news program, Tech News Today, I mean, we get pulled down from YouTube all the time.
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:52.940]   Our news program, Tech News Today, ran that mega download, or mega download.com video.
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:57.780]   Even though that video itself was not an infringing video, but the Universal Music Group decided
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:01.900]   it was, Universal Music Group also asked Tech News Today to be pulled down.
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.140]   We appealed it.
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:04.780]   They pulled it down again.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.140]   We appealed it again.
[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:11.940]   You know, finally, it was put back up on YouTube.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:15.500]   It's funny, Matt, because you do work for the company that owns YouTube.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.660]   And YouTube is, in many cases, been hand in glove with the music and the recording and
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:22.020]   the motion picture industry.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:27.500]   Well, what's interesting to me is I went to DC last year and did a Q&A.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.380]   And it was just for staffers.
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:33.740]   And most places, if you, you know, say, ask me anything about Google, they'll say, "How
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:34.740]   does Google work?
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.100]   You know, how do I rank higher?
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.260]   How do I get my word out to constituents?"
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:44.300]   And I was pretty shocked at how many questions were about YouTube and DMCA and copyright.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.620]   Oh, isn't it interesting?
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.620]   Wow.
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:50.540]   And what I realized is a lot of people have this conception that YouTube is still this,
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:54.420]   you know, like it was in the very early days where you could find all these shows.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:58.660]   And Google has done a very good job of trying to make sure that, you know, if you're the
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:03.900]   copyright owner, you can make sure the copies are down or you can, you know, monetize it.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.580]   You've got a lot of different options.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:06.580]   So we've heard hard.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:09.300]   But at the same time, you're absolutely right.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:14.900]   Like with TNT, it's totally the case that you sometimes see overly broad takedowns.
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.580]   You can see mistaken takedowns.
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:20.540]   You can see takedowns that end up almost looking capricious because it turns out the person
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.620]   didn't have the copyright.
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:27.260]   We've seen all kinds of fake DMCA requests where people are just trying to hurt either
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:31.700]   competitors or trying to basically do some prank or something like that.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:34.220]   So the notion that this process won't be abused.
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:37.700]   And we already see it abused under DMCA is just crazy.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:39.700]   I guess that's the point of that.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:42.700]   One of the points of that video that we just aired in, we didn't air it on.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:45.540]   I'll tell you what, I'll play it at the end of Twig so you can see it.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:46.980]   But it explains why SOPA is bad.
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:53.060]   And one of the things the video points out is, well, there's a lot of things the video
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.060]   points out.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:57.260]   But one of the things the video points out is that there are bill, there are laws like
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:02.940]   DMCA and pro IP that already in place, there are any counterfeiting laws that can, that
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:06.340]   are more than adequate and have problems already.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.060]   We don't need to go a step farther.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:11.540]   Tim O'Reilly, we're trying to get Tim on, he's in a plane.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:14.740]   And when he makes his connection, we're trying to get him on by phone.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:16.780]   But he's been really great on Google Plus.
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:18.940]   A lot of posts on Google Plus.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:23.940]   But one of the posts he put up a couple of days ago that I thought was great, before solving
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:29.420]   a problem, make sure you've got the right problem, he talks about the, unfortunately,
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:35.380]   people framed this debate, often frame it around, is it about piracy?
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:40.540]   But in fact, he says, really, that's a misframed argument.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:45.540]   The losses due to piracy far are far outweighed by the benefits of the internet, by the free
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:47.500]   flow of information.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:50.780]   History shows us again and again, frontiers are lawless places.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:55.540]   But as they get richer and more settled, they join in the rule of law.
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.260]   American Publishing, listen carefully.
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:06.420]   American Publishing, now the largest publishing industry in the world, began with piracy,
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:11.380]   began by stealing others' works.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:15.220]   He says, we've got to reframe this conversation.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.860]   Piracy isn't the problem.
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:22.020]   And even if you thought it was, these bills won't make a difference.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:26.660]   Because pirates just go ahead and go around anything like this.
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:33.140]   Earlier this month, where digital sales are now higher than physical sales of music.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:38.060]   And early on, you definitely saw a sort of antagonism towards digital sales by a lot
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.740]   of people in the content industry.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:49.380]   And just as they hated VCRs, cassettes, MP3 players, freaking piano player roles.
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:52.260]   At the turn of the last century, they tried to stop.
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:57.140]   They're going to put the music in their head of business.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:02.260]   Leo, I think one of the things that Tim makes so, the he of all people can make this argument
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:06.220]   because he is a publisher, he sees the benefits, is that there's no, we haven't proven the
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.220]   harm here.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.220]   Exactly.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.980]   How many of those, and it's proving a negative, how many of those people who did pirate the
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.140]   work would have bought it, having not pirated it?
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.260]   Probably very few.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:20.380]   How many people, instead, however, did discover the work because it was pirated?
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:23.140]   It could be very high.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:29.300]   And Paul Aqualo, the author, I wrote about this in the last book, he has sold more than
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:33.340]   100 million books, yet he pirates his own works.
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:37.740]   Because he discovered that when he put up, when people did pirate his works in other languages,
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:42.100]   like Russian before the book was out, his sales in those countries went up.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:48.980]   And he pirated his own works and his publisher caught him, Jane Friedman caught him, because
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:51.780]   he said, "Oh no, somebody pirated you."
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:55.220]   And it turned out it was the, you know, the editor of the son pirate.
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:56.220]   They put it up on pirate bay.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.220]   Paul Aqualo did it himself.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:01.300]   Yeah, and it was the wrong version, but he said, "Okay, you caught me, but let's look
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:03.660]   at the business opportunities here."
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:06.580]   And you know, he, Paolo yelled at me, I was giving away books at an event, and he said,
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:07.900]   "Don't give away books, sell books."
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:11.340]   You know, so he's very much a salesman, very much believes in it, but he sees the benefit
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.340]   of things being spread in this way.
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:17.620]   And I think it's the lack of harm too, and I'm going to start the drinking game early,
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:21.780]   but you go back to Ted's point about early publishing and Gutenberg.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:28.340]   You know, this notion of owning intellectual property is fairly recent in history.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:33.140]   And I think that what's happening too is we're going through a phase in society where
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:37.260]   we're going back to the idea that I just wrote about David Weinberger's magnificent
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:41.140]   new book, "Too Big to Know," and knowledge becomes the network.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:44.460]   It doesn't become the property of individuals in it.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:47.340]   And that's our old model, and that's the way we used to do this.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.980]   And I think that this is really about trying to rethink the shape of our world, and that's
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:55.060]   why the institutions are having such trouble with this.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.620]   That's why the Rupert Murdochs are belching everywhere.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.700]   Look at this tweet from MC Hammer.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:06.100]   He says, "Stop SOPA," and there is Hammer with two guys from Firefox standing in front
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:07.100]   of the Capitol building.
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:08.100]   I love it.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:10.020]   He says, "Need we say more."
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.500]   So even artists, I think not all artists, but many artists understand that the internet
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:18.700]   has given them far more opportunities than it has taken away from them.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:23.500]   And you say an interesting thing, Jeff, and Tim O'Reilly says this as well.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:29.140]   We often conflate, the way the arguments misshapen is, we conflate intellectual property with
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.540]   real property.
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:34.900]   And we think that, you know, steal my phone, that's real property, but steal my idea is
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:42.380]   not real property and is not protected in the Constitution or by the founders never intended
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:43.740]   to protect intellectual property.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:49.200]   In fact, they said very clearly that the copyright laws and the patent laws were designed to
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:57.860]   protect the inventor for a limited time, a very limited time, just 14 years, and that
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:03.140]   ultimately that intellectual property was the property of society and belong to society
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:05.620]   to promote the arts and sciences.
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.740]   And so this whole idea that somehow something is like, that it's real property that's being
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:13.700]   stolen, even that is fallacious and especially in a digital society.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:20.700]   And I go through this all the time, but in media, we've been brought up to think that
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.700]   all the value is encased in the product.
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:32.460]   That's why we sell it.
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:36.420]   And I've said this, I think on the show before, but Mark Zuckerberg realizes differently.
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:41.140]   Content has value, but its value is to get people to generate signals about themselves.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.620]   Why do you think Google invented Google Plus?
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:45.420]   Because why is it in Android?
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:49.700]   Because we're using these things to generate signals about ourselves that allow those services
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:54.540]   to give us more targeted and relevant content services and advertising and extract more
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:57.300]   value from their relationships with us.
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:01.380]   So content does have value, but it's only one value in a chain.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:09.100]   And the way media was structured for the 550 years of Gutenberg's era was that content
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.980]   media were encased as a product and could be sold that way.
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:13.980]   That's just over.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:19.860]   So what we're seeing is more than just old companies trying to protect their copy rights.
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:22.860]   We're seeing right here two important things happening.
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:26.060]   One is the other shift of a business model around media.
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:29.580]   But second, and I'm very, very happy about this, I'm very proud of our internet, we're
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:34.780]   seeing the beginnings of, I think for the first time, the creation of a public called
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:35.780]   the net.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:36.780]   Yeah.
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:41.340]   And I think it's very, very exciting that this is the first political movement that I
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:44.740]   believe has started out of the net for the net's concerns.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.940]   And it's up to this point working.
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:51.620]   It has a one, but it's impressive in what the people of the net can do.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:54.540]   So let's remember this, folks, and let's keep fighting for other principles.
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.180]   Yeah, that's, I was going to say that.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.020]   I mean, what's going on today is just absolutely historical.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.260]   What does that say earlier though?
[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:05.540]   I mean, I think that we need to be realistic though, and accept that we're never going
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:10.860]   to convince the MPAA and the RIA that privacy is not a problem.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:13.420]   So, I agree with you guys.
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:18.860]   I just think that they're spending a lot of money convincing the powers that be that
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:22.420]   piracy is a problem, and this is why we need legislation this way.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:26.980]   So what we need to do with the tech community is to educate the government about how the
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:33.940]   internet works with as much effort and time and human hours as they're spending, educating
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:36.620]   them about how much piracy is a problem.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:39.700]   I was at the White House last Monday, which is the reason why I missed the show.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:43.140]   I was invited there for a meeting about an event that's happening in the spring, which
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.140]   I'll talk about then.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:49.220]   But after the meeting, I had a few moments to speak with Anish Chopra, who's the CTO of
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.300]   the United States.
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:56.460]   And we were talking about how does government reach out to its constituents and engage with
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:00.580]   citizens online, and Anish said, "What's the issue of the moment?"
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:03.060]   And I said, "Absolutely so."
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:12.740]   And I used, you know, I very strongly advised him to, that the administration has to put
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:13.820]   a statement out there.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:16.220]   And they did three days later.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:17.220]   Thank you, Jim.
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:21.020]   And he gave, when I was very proud of Gina, he gave the hat tip to you and Twitter, which
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.660]   was really so cool.
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:23.660]   He did.
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:27.620]   Well, I told him that I would boost his follower count by mentioning him on Twitter,
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:28.700]   which I did.
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:34.220]   And then said, "Oh, hey, flowers, you're welcome."
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:35.220]   And he said, "Okay."
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.620]   And then he went on the White House responded.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:41.180]   Gina, say that again, because we broke up a little bit.
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:42.180]   We lost her.
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:44.940]   Oh, sorry about that.
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:48.980]   I had mentioned on it, and on Twitter, saying that, you know, tech community should follow
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:49.980]   him.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:53.780]   And I think, kind of in return, he gave me that hat tip for the White House's response.
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:58.140]   But the White House was working on that response when I was out the White House.
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:01.140]   So I don't certainly don't take credit for that.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.140]   What's his Twitter handle?
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:03.140]   I want to follow him.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:04.140]   Anis Chopra.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:09.580]   Anis Chopra is his name and his Twitter handle is his name.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:10.580]   A-N-I-S-H.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:11.580]   A-N-E-G-S-H.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:12.580]   C-H-O-P-R-A.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:16.780]   All right, I'll follow him right there.
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   There we go.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.420]   Chief technology officer.
[02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:20.500]   So follow.
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.900]   There you go.
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:23.900]   See?
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.900]   See?
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:27.620]   I do think this makes an important point.
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:34.460]   And ReadRight, Scott Fulton, writing a ReadRight web also makes this point.
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:35.940]   All right.
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:41.420]   So we've shown we can be negative Nellies and say, "Don't pass it."
[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:46.180]   But then the challenge is, "Okay, come up with a solution."
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.260]   Right, I mean, that's just a problem.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:49.460]   Well, I agree with you.
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:52.660]   And that's his, and you go back to Twitter about a month ago.
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:54.980]   Nille Patel and I had a big debate over this.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:59.820]   And Nille, who was a lawyer by training, said, "You can't just say no.
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:02.220]   You have to offer a compromise position."
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:05.380]   My position was digital technologies.
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:09.820]   There is no technology that effectively prevents piracy.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:13.420]   The solution is to reinvent your business model.
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:14.420]   Yes.
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:16.060]   Not to break the internet and computers.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:20.740]   And I do believe that the people who control content today wish computers and the internet
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.580]   would just go away.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:26.020]   The reason we chose to go black and white today instead of black and tireless, I want
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:29.580]   to talk it back to the 50s, where there was no internet.
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.820]   There was no computer.
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:35.940]   And of course, at that time, people, those guys hated other things.
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:38.460]   There were other technologies they hated.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.620]   But they would love computers in the internet to go away and failing that, they know that's
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.140]   not going to happen.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:49.100]   Let's modify them in such a way that we don't have to fear them instead of reinventing their
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:50.100]   business model.
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:51.900]   There's plenty of money to be made.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:56.860]   But the problem that they perceive it is that there's piracy going on on foreign websites
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:01.460]   and the United States needs a way to address that.
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:04.260]   Well, is there a way, though?
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.260]   I don't know.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.260]   I don't have a better way.
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:12.460]   I mean, this bill, I mean, this is an attempt to give the United States a way to address
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:18.300]   there's a foreign website, non-US website offering copyrighted material, which is illegal,
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.700]   and how do we address that?
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.060]   This is not the solution, but what is the solution?
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:25.340]   I mean, when I brought this up with a niece, she said to me, do you know why this bill
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:26.340]   even started?
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:31.020]   It's because we need a way to address a criminal activity on foreign websites.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:35.620]   And it is, listen, offering copyrighted material is a crime right now.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:36.620]   Right?
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.620]   So what is this?
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:38.620]   How could--
[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:40.220]   Well, Al-Gina, hold on there.
[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:43.460]   What happens in China is not a crime in the US.
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:45.620]   It's a crime in China if China has the right laws.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:48.460]   And it's not a crime in China, this part of the problem?
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:52.660]   Yeah, so that's what this is trying to do is to fill in laws and enforcement in lands
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:53.660]   where it doesn't exist.
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:59.580]   But we don't have-- unless we want to do some extradition and we've done things like that.
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.780]   We've got no way of stopping the Chinese.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:05.820]   So we do what the Chinese did, which is create a great firewall of the United States.
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:06.820]   Right.
[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:07.820]   And obviously, terrible idea.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:08.820]   Go ahead.
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:09.820]   Sorry.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:12.700]   I was going to say, obviously, that's a terrible idea, right?
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:16.500]   But that's what this read-write web article is saying, that the administration is saying,
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:20.100]   like, OK, if this is a terrible idea, then what can we do?
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:21.100]   OK.
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.100]   Here's the idea.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:23.620]   Leo is absolutely right, I think.
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:28.020]   And you start to encourage and teach industries new models.
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:31.180]   Now, will various of those companies succeed?
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.180]   Not necessarily.
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:35.180]   The thing that I've been talking about, and I think I've just decided today that we're
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:41.860]   going to try to build a demo of this at CUNY, is to build embeddable units of content.
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:48.220]   So I'm going to come back to Google+, and Richard Jingeris and folks, and try to get
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:53.340]   a guardian article, let's say, off their API, embedded not only in my blog, but also on
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:59.060]   Google+, with their brand, with their revenue, with their analytics, with links.
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:01.940]   You change the model, a movie that passes around.
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:03.700]   Maybe it should pass around with advertising in it.
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:05.540]   And if you want the clean version, you buy it.
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.860]   Otherwise, you get some monetization with it.
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:15.340]   I don't know, but trying to preserve the old model in a new reality is not the solution.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:16.340]   And it is a misstatement.
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:17.940]   This is where Tim Riley is really so right.
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.340]   It's a complete misstatement of the problem.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:22.220]   There's not a proof of harm here.
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:26.220]   So before we get demanded by the White House or rewrite web, then, well, OK, then you
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.420]   call it with something better.
[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:29.260]   No, absolutely not.
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:30.860]   You come up and show us the harm.
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:35.220]   You show us the real facts that make it worthwhile to ruin the friggin internet.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.220]   It's not.
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:41.260]   And it's interesting because I try to think about how to step into the minds of the people
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:47.340]   who are facing these problems, because I understand if you're a movie producer or someone who
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:52.900]   writes music, you don't want pirated content to take away from your living.
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:54.620]   So there's two different cases.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:08:00.780]   There's collateral damage, really legit businesses that could be taken down by mistaken practices.
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:03.060]   And then there's the egregious sort of stuff.
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:07.140]   And on the egregious sort of stuff, my spam fighting instinct kicks in a little bit.
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:10.820]   So to be a good spammer, you need reputation like links.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:14.300]   You need content, something that the search engine can key off of.
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:16.940]   But most importantly, you need a way to monetize.
[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:21.260]   And there's been a study where people looked at email spam, and they basically figured
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:28.100]   out that most of the credit card processing went through something like three banks based
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:29.700]   in Eastern Europe.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:33.580]   And so a lot of the times, if you actually follow the money to either the credit card
[02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:39.020]   processors or the other payment processors, you'll find that there's some very small points
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:40.780]   where you could actually have a big impact there.
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:44.820]   And so there is an act called Open where people are talking about following the money.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:50.500]   But Matt, how well is that worked in stopping email spam?
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:57.460]   The interesting thing on email spam is I think Gmail has been a huge technological improvement
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:08:59.620]   over what was previously working with email.
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:02.740]   Because you're filtering it, not because you're stopping it.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:03.740]   Because we're...
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:04.740]   What is it?
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:07.700]   95% of all traffic on the internet is still spam.
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:08.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:12.180]   But for an average user, they don't have to see spam in their inbox.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:13.180]   Well, that's my point.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.100]   There are technological solutions.
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.540]   But you cannot stop piracy.
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:19.100]   You cannot stop spam.
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:24.380]   If black holes, if black lists worked like they're proposing in SOPA and PIPA, we wouldn't
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:25.460]   have any spam.
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:26.460]   They don't work.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.940]   Oh, you can totally fill your way back.
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.820]   We haven't stopped spam.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.820]   We just don't see it.
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:33.820]   Right.
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:37.820]   Well, and what's interesting is the very first thing I worked on at Google was safe search,
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:39.300]   which is our family filter.
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:42.860]   And there was a Dilbert that came out that basically said, "So you're going to try to
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:45.860]   keep every 14-year-old boy from getting to porn.
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:52.900]   Did you know that a snowball lasts longer in hell if you put a little hat on it?"
[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:57.820]   You can't keep people who really are going to go to, they'll go all over to find stuff.
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:02.020]   But you can try to make it easier so that people don't run across it on a daily basis.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:08.660]   But what doesn't work, because I've seen how the brittle aspect of black lists dealing
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:13.140]   with trying to mark explicit porn sites and not the idea of outsourcing that through a
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:18.100]   private right of action to other companies who don't necessarily aren't necessarily as
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.700]   tech savvy, that just seems like a recipe for disaster.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:23.500]   So in the chat, we're saying, "Well, what about physical goods?
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:25.500]   What about Chanel handbags and Rolex watches?"
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:30.540]   I would submit that anybody who would buy a fake Chanel handbag or Rolex wristwatch would
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:34.580]   not buy the original under any circumstances anyway.
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.860]   So what you cannot say is that Rolex loses money to fake Rolex wristwatches.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:45.900]   No, and in fact, Leo, I went to a meeting by Rishmaul in South Africa last year, and
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:49.740]   they talked about what they're going to offer is the danger there really is that someone
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.540]   thinks they're buying a real one and get ripped off.
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:53.540]   Okay.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:55.020]   A phony gets passed off.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:11:00.460]   So what they see the need to do is to create new verification mechanisms.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.460]   So before you buy it, you can verify that this is real.
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:07.980]   But that's not the overseas website problem, because if you're buying Chanel handbags from
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:08.980]   an overseas website.
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:09.980]   No, you're right.
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:11.460]   Well, you should just know better.
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.460]   You're right, Leo.
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:13.460]   You're not going to buy it.
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:14.460]   You're not going to buy a real one anyway.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:15.460]   Right.
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:17.460]   Here's another way to look at it.
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:19.340]   There were more cases today.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:23.540]   Zappos are looking at so many things the wrong way.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:28.580]   And I wish I'd been on with Steve before this to ask him this question slightly off topic,
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:33.460]   but all the security breaches and oh my God, people have my credit card number and my address
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.180]   and my social security number.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:38.900]   Shouldn't we set up transactional methods so that it doesn't matter if anybody has my
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:40.860]   credit card, my social security number or whatever.
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:41.860]   Right.
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:42.860]   We're doing this the wrong way.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:45.360]   We're trying to play the whack-a-mole that Matt's talking about of getting rid of the bad
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:48.560]   guys rather than creating new and better systems and models.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:54.140]   If we had some means that was biometric and informational that let me and only me do transactions
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:57.860]   under my name, then I wouldn't care if anybody has my social security number.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:00.060]   It's not the secret to my universe.
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:01.060]   We're doing it the wrong way.
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:02.060]   So same here.
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:06.100]   I think that Matt's quite right is to try to stop that thing from happening isn't going
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:07.100]   to work.
[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:11.140]   So you create better systems that bring the good stuff up, make it easier to buy things.
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:14.380]   Steve Jobs proved that that worked in music.
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:16.320]   Is the revenue the same?
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320]   Is the monopoly pricing the same?
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.360]   Well, no, but welcome to a new world.
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.240]   Everybody have a chance to speak along to these lines, Matt.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.080]   You have anything else you want to say before we move along?
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:32.360]   I think we're preaching to the converted here.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:33.360]   Yeah.
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.360]   I don't.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.880]   I think anybody who's watching this show knows exactly why they hate SOPA.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:44.360]   But it is very cool when you were talking to the EFF guy to hear the 29 Congress people
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.720]   have reversed the position today.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.720]   That's pretty wild.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.880]   And as you say, this is much larger than Pippa and SOPA.
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.280]   This is, I think you'll be, we'll be able to look back on this day and say this is the
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:57.280]   day the internet showed its power.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.320]   And we, the people of the internet, maybe do have a little bit of clout.
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:09.840]   And we're not just a bunch of, you know, bearded, neck bearded guys in their underwear.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:10.840]   They're sitting in their basements.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:11.840]   Right.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:15.280]   Plus one thing that may be very happy about the discussion, the White House statement,
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.720]   was that it rose to the level of principle.
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.280]   And, and, you know, that's what I talked about in my book is the need for discussion
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:24.680]   of principles because we get down in the nitty gritty of trying to recreate an old model
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.680]   or protect one little thing.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:29.840]   We've got to deal with the full principles, the precedence that occur here and the why
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.840]   and the where for.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.320]   And at some point the White House has to decide and Congress has to decide is it more
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:38.080]   important to protect an entertainment company or free speech?
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:41.000]   And where are they going to put their, their capital and effort in doing this?
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.520]   And we have to have this discussion at the level of principles and protecting these principles
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.640]   for a future.
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:48.720]   And that's what I'm so delighted about is that we're having here is we're saying that
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.840]   SOPA is one of many bad things going on in trying to screw the internet.
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:55.520]   But this is the one where it went too far and this is the one we're going to stop and
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:57.320]   we're going to have this discussion in the basis of principles.
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.080]   And I hope this strengthens our, our muscle.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:05.200]   And, and our protest muscle and we, and now that we understand that we have, we have some
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.920]   say in the matter that that we all stay involved and active.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:10.920]   We vote.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.720]   We pay attention to these issues.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.840]   But now, you know, I think it's really important that we have a balance, a descending viewpoint.
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:22.080]   So ladies and gentlemen, we take you to Rupert Murdoch who says.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:28.400]   So, Obama has thrown in his lot with Silicon Valley paymasters who threaten all software
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:30.000]   creators with piracy.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000]   Please.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.560]   Can you do that with an Australian accent?
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.160]   Yeah, plain savory.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:40.000]   Piracy later is Google who streams movies free, sells advertisements around them.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.800]   No wonder pouring millions into the lobbying.
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.200]   So as you point out in your, this is from Jeff's blog post saying Rupert Murdoch doesn't
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.000]   understand links.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.880]   He really does it.
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:55.440]   It's all your fall back cuts.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.880]   I blame you.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:02.280]   Um, I don't know what to say about this.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:04.600]   He thinks to link to things is to steal them.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]   Right.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:06.600]   He's sending them audience.
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:08.040]   He does not understand that basic basic structure.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.960]   So he's always thought that aggregators were content clubbed of maniacs in the words
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:14.120]   of one of his recently ousted lieutenants.
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:20.720]   And now he thinks that for Google to just link to bad stuff is, is, is Google doing it?
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:23.240]   And he thinks the whole internet is on by Google.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:27.640]   I saw, um, here's the, here's the, here's the, here's the smoking gun post.
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:31.120]   I've just been to Google search for mission and possible.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.120]   Wow.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:33.720]   So I'm going to go to websites offering free links.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:35.400]   I rest my case.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:43.120]   Jeff, he says that happened at a CES when he got a demo of Google TV and was shown how
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.600]   to search for TV.
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.200]   And he asked if I search for mission and possible, well, you know, these bad things come up
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:49.200]   too.
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.280]   And the answer was, yes, search.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.520]   And he went berserk.
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.720]   He says in his latest post, 19 hours ago, don't care about people, not buying movies,
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:00.720]   programs or newspapers, just stealing them.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:01.720]   I'm sorry.
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:02.720]   So, okay.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:11.320]   So if we don't buy anything from him ever again, he won't, he doesn't care about that.
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:12.320]   No problem.
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:13.320]   No problem.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:14.320]   Just don't steal.
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:19.360]   Well, actually, you know, that, that there is some internal consistency to that because
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:23.640]   the presumption being that if once stolen, that was a purchase that we've lost.
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:27.600]   But he accuses Google of being the thief, right?
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:30.920]   You stole it instead of buying it.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:35.080]   Oh, he says AFL CIO supports SOPA.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.600]   Well, we better talk to those union leaders.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:40.760]   How about that?
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:43.600]   I have to say though, I'm not, I don't want to make too much fun of Rupert because at
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:44.600]   least he's tweeting.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.360]   I mean, this is him obviously.
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:53.200]   And how many CEOs, only only a guy like Rupert Murdoch with huge amounts of power within
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.360]   his company would get the permission to tweet.
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.600]   He doesn't ask permission.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:16:59.600]   He just does.
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:00.960]   Yeah, he gives it.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:03.960]   I'm going to say what I want.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.200]   All right.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.560]   But now it's Matt's turn to get on the hot seat.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.480]   And we're going to do that in just a little bit because Google made some big changes.
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:15.960]   I don't know, Matt, if you saw a Twitter this week, but we went into great detail with
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:24.920]   Danny Sullivan about this search plus my world and some of the real interesting conflict
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.560]   of interest issues that it raises.
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.520]   And I'm going to give you every chance to respond to that.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:31.840]   So we'll do that in just a little bit.
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.960]   This is of course the day, the internet fought back.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.200]   That's why we're in black and white.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:46.880]   We invite you to go to blackout.ef.org or americansensorship.org or reddit.com or one
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:54.920]   of WordPress.com or wired.com and learn more, wikipedia.org and learn more about this and
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:55.920]   how.
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:59.640]   So primarily, chief of which is a call you remember of congress.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:01.880]   Now of course we're a global show.
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:06.720]   More than a third of our audiences outside the US don't think this doesn't affect you.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:08.720]   These laws are being passed all over the world.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:17.240]   Most recently Spain, France, the world intellectual property organization, the running dog of
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.400]   the US content industry is working on passing bills exactly like this all over the world.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.640]   So the fight goes on everywhere.
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.920]   Just as much at risk as we are.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.760]   Well I hope you've enjoyed this best of this week in Google as much as we've enjoyed doing
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:36.000]   Google this week in Google all year long.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.600]   Such a great show.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.440]   And we like to thank all the people who join us on a regular basis like Google's own, Matt
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.800]   cuts, Kevin Marks, Kevin perdy.
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:46.560]   There's so many great people to do this show with us.
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.040]   Aaron Newcomb, it's so much fun.
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.840]   And remember it's not just about Google, it's about the cloud, it's about Facebook,
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:52.840]   it's about Twitter.
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:57.760]   It's about these new technologies that are really changing how we interact, how we communicate,
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:00.240]   impact things like privacy and security.
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:02.480]   So I think we're going to have a lot to talk about.
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:05.960]   But Gina, Jeff and me in 2013, I hope you'll join us.
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:10.960]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.200]   That's about 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2100 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:19.840]   Live is great if you can watch because I love the interaction we get from the chat.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:25.080]   But if you can't watch live, please download audio or video to show off to the fact that
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.440]   do me a favor and subscribe.
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.760]   But we'll get every episode of You With A Prussian.
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:32.880]   Have a safe, happy and healthy new year.
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.080]   And we'll see you right back here in 2013.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:36.080]   I'm Leo LaPorn.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.080]   Take care.
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:47.080]   [MUSIC]
