[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Twig this week in Google coming up in just a little bit.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.160]   Jeff and Gina, we're gonna take a look at fact as we speak I think at the quarterly results
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   they're just coming in from Facebook and from Apple Good News and bad news.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   Robert Scobble's giving up on glass, what a surprise, and a special plea to get Gina into Google I/O.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show that covers not just Google.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I hasten to add, but all of the cloud stuff, the social stuff, the anything online.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And frankly anything that Jeff and Gina want to talk about.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York, CUNY.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He is a professor of journalism there.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So the author of "What Would Google Do in As Ladies Is Public Hearts?"
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And he joins us each week to rant, rave and shave his beard.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You got a problem with that?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We'll talk about the shaving in just a bit.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But first, let's say hello to your co-host, the lovely Italian, Gina Trapani, from Brooklyn, New York.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   She is the developer, one of the developers behind ThinkUp.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I guess you're the developer at ThinkUp.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hi, I'm a CTO if you want to talk about highfalutin titles.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   She's the person.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   She's the CTO of ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Or as Mark Zuckerberg would say, CTO, bitch.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The op.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I wouldn't say that, but he would.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Not what I would say, but yes.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   No, I know you would.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   That.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   No.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   She's also the host of "All About Android" and missed the show yesterday.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I bet you it was killing you because Coach was on the show yesterday.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It was killing me.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I was typing it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I was like, Jason said, do you have any questions?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I started typing a very long email with many questions.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So I was really sad.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Coach Chiktutra, who was on the Cyanogen Mod team and now does clockwork mod, helium, and all cast.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I haven't seen the show yet.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Anything you want to share from that show?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I mean, he's just great.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I just think he's it.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I actually have it queued up in my play or I haven't been able to watch it either.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It had a busy day today.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Very exciting.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But I was really, really sad to miss it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The problem with having a one year old is that you get every single call that her classmates at school get.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm a little bit excited.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I'm sure it's a great interview.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Last night's all about Android.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So Google I/O.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Let's talk a little bit about that before we get into the news.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's coming up.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We're excited about it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And a June, right?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Everybody's going to be there except not all of us.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Google, well, you know, I think it got to be very popular.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And this might be Google's fault a little bit because they keep giving away so much stuff.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That I think everybody wants to go.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And of course, Google, this is their developer conference.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Their strongest interest is in getting in people who are, you know, Android and Google developers.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   That's what the events for.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then there's press.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But we, you know, we warm up seats.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And traditionally we haven't had too much trouble getting in this year.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They told us only two passes.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So now we have a conundrum.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And the only reason I'm included is because I applied from saying Twig was my affiliation.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   As you should have.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Now I'm not going to go.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I've already recused myself.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Mostly because we're going to cover it live and it's impossible to cover the keynote live if you're in the keynote.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Unless you want to, as I did try once and it didn't work well.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And now Larry's going to the stage.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   He's brought his eight iron.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I think he's.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Oh boy.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So I'll stay home and we'll cover it live.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   We'll do the live keynote of course.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And then what we've done in the past in this works quite well is that Jeff and Gina would be in the event.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Actually, I went last year, but traditionally Jeff and Gina be in the event and then rush up here and we do it this week in Google.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Unfortunately, we can't get you both in.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Yeah, you know, I didn't make the, I didn't get a press pass, which I was okay with.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We got two and then I in my, I saw most some monic mode gave one to Jason Howell of all about Android.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah, you really wanted to go.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And then one to Jeff and what I was hoping, and this was our gamble, is that you would apply as a developer.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We pay for all of that, but that you would get in as a developer because you are a developer.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You're an Android developer to do.txt as an Android app.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Right, right.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I went through the application process, which asked you, you know, do you have an app in the play store?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   If so, what's the URL?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   They, they authorized the $900 on my credit card through Google Wallet because that's the cost, you know, without charging you.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And I thought, okay, you know, I answered a few questions and I thought, you know, what I'm interested in that kind of thing.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And I thought, okay, I probably, I maybe, it seems like I should have a good shot if.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Did you think that they look at all that stuff or is it totally random?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I mean, why, well, I mean, why would they ask if you had an app in the play store if they didn't look at it?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So I thought I had a good shot, but I didn't ask it.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   If you have the most listened to show about Google in the entire world, did they ask that?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   They didn't ask that.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yes, see, they should, they need a new field in the form.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   They need a new field for that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Two of the most listened to shows.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   All about Android is easily the number one Android show in the nation in the world, and this is about the only show about Google in the world.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So we went on that guy.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So Leo, did you think any of them Google watches a show?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Well, that's the irony of that is that nobody at Google watches this show or is, has any idea we even exist, apparently.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Apparently not.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I would really like to get, you know, you know, I was really, I was totally willing to pay the $900.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I wasn't the problem at all.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, Jim, everybody stands here.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Let's be clear here.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Gina's getting, no matter what, I'm transferring my past to Gina.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, hold on, Mr. Galant.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But, but.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I know, he's being so gentlemanly.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We want to have the show there.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   We want it.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Gina and I are a Google couple.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   To split apart this Google marriage.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We're willing to cross countries and time zones.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   We are ready to fly out.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Coach, for God's sakes, to see this thing.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I actually, I actually, I don't know what I was going to say.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You're not going to fly, Coach?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I actually would give you my past, Gina, if I had one, but I don't.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So don't think it's just Jeff is the only person that would do that.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   No, no, you're both very galon.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I gave Jeff my past.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I don't want the audience going after me insane.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Jarvis is going to not Gina.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And the reason we want to go, of course, is because we want to give you the best possible
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   coverage.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Yes.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And they might give away a watch.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We're kind of that.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Yeah, I admit I kind of want the watch.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You know, it's funny.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I have really mixed feelings about this because on one hand, I'm sad that I didn't, that I didn't get in, but on the other, Kevin and I did this whole episode of
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   in beta talking about these big developer shows and how they, how they had turned into these press events and how people who got in were only people who had money and who were there that two minutes when the registration was open.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So a part of me that's really kind of glad that Google's cracking down on press and making the, the application process for developers, you know, a lot more sort of equal opportunity.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Like I'm all for that.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   The rest of the press and the other developers, you're different.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I just want to say that if, if Google's smart, they will give no swag away at this year's Google I/O and they will never have this problem again.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The people have the number of people.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Although we're going to spend the money and go to the effort to go to this, are going to be those who care.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Right.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   There was a story somewhere down on the rundown today about Google class and somebody like Google person said, we charged 1500 bucks because we wanted people who were serious about that.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So Google shouldn't have people who were serious about this.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I agree.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   But, you know, in all in all truth, by being there last year, I really did absorb a lot that affects our coverage through the year.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I mean, I understood more about, about Android strategy and Chrome strategy and voice strategy and all these other things.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And, and to get around, to hang around with the people who actually do this stuff for dumb old me is really useful.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I do, I do have to say that, I don't, I'm, what's happening to my brain.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I can't remember what I had to say.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It was seconds ago.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I do have to say that we will cover it no matter what.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And that all of these developer conferences are huge, mostly because of the success of, I mean, because of things like WhatsApp.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I mean, if you want to make money in the tech business these days, you're an app developer.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   You're developing either for iOS or Android.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   WWDC and Apple does not, no, does not give away anything to developers.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   WWDC, same issue.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   You know, the signups go instantly.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They just can't make these big enough.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Now, to Google's credit, the entire thing is streaming, right?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So if you're a developer, what you lose is the, is the press, the flesh, the meeting people, the connections you make.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But the content is available to you instantly, right?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And this swag, I think, is really part of it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It has sort of become like Oprah's Christmas special, you know, where it's not just fans.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It's the folks that want to get, get the stuff and look all of it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I'm part of that.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   If they're giving away to watch, I want my fans, you know, on the watch first.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Right?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Because most likely it'll be a prototype and it won't be out to everyone yet.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And I'm a developer and I'll get to develop not only in a simulator, but on an actual piece of hardware.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That'd be amazing if there's going to be a low powered Nexus.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   If the, you know, whatever that they have kind of up their sleeves, of course I want access to that.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So there's that part of it.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And I'll admit being part of that.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That's true.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   That's the important thing there too is, listen, I've proven, I'll buy anything they make, you know, Jesus.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And we know this, yeah.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Chromebook, you know, can I prove that?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   So that's not the issue.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But two years ago when you guys went, sorry, there go my lights.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And you got, even though it didn't really turn into a product, what was the round thing?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   The Nexus Q.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The Q. Right.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I mean, that's what made me jealous is because you had something that no one else had.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And never got.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Never got.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I wanted to play with it and understand what their brain was and what they were thinking.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That's the more valuable piece of the swag.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'll buy it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I'll buy it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I'll buy it.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I'll be buying the Nexus 8 if you do it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I'll buy all your stuff.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's awesome.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I don't want to pay.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's that you want it sooner, right?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And don't forget glass as well.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   You got to sign up for glass.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   By the way, by the way, Google, I bought the damn glass.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I bought the darn lenses.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I mean, really?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   How far do I have to go?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I wrote a book about you.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Come on, babe.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Come on.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I don't want to spend too much of the show begging.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   But there you go.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   One of these guys will be there.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   We don't want to wear it better.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   If with any luck, both of them will be there.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And I will stay home and you can bring back the glass.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   We have Facebook quarterly results just coming in.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Also, word, and I'm going to check this, that Apple has issued a 7 to 1 stock plate.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   That must be an error.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   2 to 1.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Apple's putting stock 7 to 1.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   We're going to check that out.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   While I do a little commercial, we'll get the latest news.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Jeff and Gina are here.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   This is this week in Google.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   The begging is over.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The show will now begin.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I just imagine every time we talk about this, that kind of stuff, I know Matt cuts, listens.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And last time he said he was running, and he was listening, and he stopped, and he ended
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   his run so he could quickly report a bug.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So Matt continued to run.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's fine.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We'll be fine.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Don't interrupt your run on this on our account.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I'm really excited about Full Sail University.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Full Sail is a, they have both a campus and an online degree program centered on real world
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   experience in entertainment, media, and technology.

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And right now you've got to be proficient at using advanced web-based tools and techniques.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   You've got to be able to reach customers and consumers in the digital environment, online
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   marketing, things like web-based channel search technologies, analytics are all kind of things
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   you need to know to be in the forefront of today's advertising and branding strategies.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Full Sail University offers an online internet marketing master's degree program designed
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   for professionals who want to keep pace with these new marketing technologies.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You'll be learning things like search engine optimization, social media marketing, web
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   metrics, analytics, and online consumer behavior.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You'll be working on real products, problems are real projects with real clients.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's how you can best gain experience and generate results and learn from industry experience
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and structures.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Full Sail University's online and campus degree programs are always centered on real world education
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   experience with industry technology and workflow.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Through their innovative curriculum, you'll learn your master's degree in just 12 months.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   How about that?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   All while you work at your regular job.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Through Full Sail's project launch box program, students also get this, a MacBook Pro, preloaded
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   with Apple's complete line of created software tools, as well as degree specific sets of pro-level applications.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   How do you like that?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In addition to internet marketing, it's not the only one.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You also offer a variety of master's programs and related fields including business intelligence.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   That would be a skill to learn.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Innovation and entrepreneurship and new media journalism.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   To learn more about Full Sail's master degree program in internet marketing or any of their
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   related programs, visit our website, fullsail.edu/twig.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Full Sail.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   F-U-L-L-S-A-I-L, like your sales are billowing out and you're on your way to the finish line.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Go to www.fccproposingnewnet neutrality rules that kill net neutrality.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   So, bastards.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I'm going to go to www.investor.stock.com.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So, the chat room says Apple raising share buyback from $90 billion to $90 billion from $60 billion.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   There's a link in the chat room to TechCrunch on the split.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   7-for-1's stock split boosts this 10-8%.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I've heard of two-for-1 that's available.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I've heard of two-for-one that's available.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I've heard of two-for-one that's available.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I've heard of two-for-one that's available.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I've heard of two-for-one that's available.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I've heard of two-for-one that's what Google just did.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I've heard of three-for-two, seven-to-one.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But here's the funny thing.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   After Google split, Apple stock, Google has been Google's been falling.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's only $13 away from Apple being the higher price than Google.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You think they want to get there first and then split?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   These are the Apple quarterly earnings coming in for fiscal Q2.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   43.7 million iPhones, 16.3 million iPads, 4.1 million Macs.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   That's a significant drop in iPhones, by the way.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Was 51 million.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Was that a good one?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It went from 51 million in the first quarter to 43.7 million in the second quarter.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Big drop.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Isn't that a normal Q2?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It is because...
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Is there a calendar?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Are they a calendar?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   No, it's fiscal.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Q1 is the calendar fourth quarter.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   It's the Christmas quarter.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Right.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   So, yes, there is always a drop, but that seems like a significant drop.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Now, year to year, it's not so bad.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's not a normal drop.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   A significant drop.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   So, the second quarter is often a bad quarter.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Last year, it was 37.4 million iPhones this year, 43.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So, they're up.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It's their upper year over year.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   However, last year was 19 million iPads, and this year was 16 million.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   So, iPhones are up year over year, but the iPads, and some analysts have said the iPads sales have been slowing.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   They did beat Wall Street's estimates, so that's always a good thing.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   What did Andy Inaco put it yesterday on Matt Freak Weekly?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It was funny.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's like if you polled sports analysts about what the finishing time would be in the Boston Marathon,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and the guy came in, won it, but came in six seconds below their analyst estimate.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   He said if they had estimated that he would come in third, they would punish him for coming in first.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Right.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   He didn't make us to fail the analyst estimates.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   iPod sales, you know, now pretty bad.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   2.7 million iPads.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I'm amazed they're selling any.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And there was no iPod update.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Year over year performance, and that's, I guess, what you really should count, is a iPhone growth of 16.8%,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and iPad drop of 16.4%.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And that's, I think, signs that maybe the tablet market has reached its...
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   What's the, what's the concomitant Android tablet sales?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But I wonder if they're losing business to Android.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I doubt it very much, but we'll, but we could check into that.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   We will check into that.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Now, this, maybe in the call, I don't know, I'm trying to find this rumor of the stock split.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Maybe they mentioned something in the call.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Or maybe the chat room is just punking us.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   No, it is a check-run.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Nope.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Nope.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   From Reuters, Apple by expands buybacks by 30 billion.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   You mentioned that.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And announces a 7 for 1 stock split.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And boosts the dividend 8%.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Wow.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Which is to say that the, the shark's got to them, I think.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   A rarely seen 7 for 1 stock split.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   So their stock was what, around 500, so.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   No, it's, oh yeah, it's, hold on.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   It brings it down well below a hundred bucks.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   524, 75.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Yeah, the idea of a stock split doesn't really change the, the capitalization of the company in any way.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Because you cut the stock price by the factor of the split.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   But what it does do is make the individual shares more affordable.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And this thinking is that, well, if it's more affordable, you know, if somebody wants to buy one share for their kid, they can.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And then, well, now you can buy an iPad and get a share.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Really?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   No.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   That's a good idea though.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It is.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You start to own the company.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   That's good.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's a great promotional device.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Do you think it was activist stockholders that he gave into?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And I think that the problem remains with, why am I getting trouble for saying this?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Oh, the letter is like, by the way, folks, by the way, folks.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's nice that you send email.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I got enough email.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I can't deal with email.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I can't deal with all the email people.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   People spend a long emails to me.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's not that we've lot of ignore you, but we just can't.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Don't send me email about what I'm about to say.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   But as Apple lost its mojo, I mean, we haven't seen major development from them.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   We haven't seen major innovation from them.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   They've got to satisfy Wall Street.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And some of Wall Street is going to say, what have you done for me lately?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's funny that you should say that because I don't buy tech stock.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.800]   So this is purely an academic conversation.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.200]   But I was going to ask Lisa this morning, have you ever shorted stock?
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.960]   Because I think it's time to short Apple.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.520]   And maybe this is a response to that.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:25.000]   I'm raising the dividend certainly helps sell stock and buying it back shows your confidence
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   in your stock.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   By the way--
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.560]   Marc, I said that's something really interesting to say in Twitter yesterday, which is of course
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   where he says everything.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   And he said the whole bubble conversation went on in tech.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   And he said, activists come in when they see things that are undervalued.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   There's no bubble.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   There's no bubble in tech.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   I don't believe that.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   I don't think there ever has been a bubble in tech.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   So there's a belief that Apple is undervalued right now.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   Maybe.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   I think it's overvalued personally.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   But I agree with you.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   I agree with you.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   Tim Cook did make his quarterly pronouncement that there are new products coming.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   They're always are.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   He's--
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.120]   Well, he said quote-- and this is a Neelite Patel quoting the wire story.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.160]   We're eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   could bring to market.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   Why only Apple?
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   We don't know.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   Because only Apple could make an iPhone.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.200]   Well, first, then TV?
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   No.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.280]   More new products and service services is interesting.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.200]   I don't know what services they're talking about.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   No.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.480]   I think what they're talking about.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.200]   If they-- and ask new iPhones this year, he will have satisfied the new products, right?
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   But well, but then, you know, we make the screen bigger.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.440]   We make the screen as well.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.200]   So an iPhone with a bigger screen is not innovation.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.120]   It's-- and I'm saying probably Android phones.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.080]   How are you going to beat your own prior story here?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.800]   And how are you going to come up with something that's new and innovative in phones?
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.400]   Nevertheless, Apple had a very-- another record-breaking quarter in terms of profits and revenues.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.960]   iPad sales slow, but iPhone sales increased.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.280]   And a 7 to 1 stock split and increased their--
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.520]   And full disclosure, I have Apple stock.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.160]   But it's probably not enough to make you a wealthy man.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   Ah, no.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   No.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   You have Apple and Google stock, we should mention.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.000]   Apple and Google and Amazon.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   And I sold Microsoft.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I sold Microsoft.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I'm really tempted.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.840]   I don't know even how you short a stock, but I'm just-- I feel like-- well, now's the wrong
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.240]   time, obviously.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   That kind of statement says a lot, though.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   If you don't know how to do it, maybe you shouldn't.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   You should do it well.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   I don't know how to--
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.280]   What is this shorting a stock thing?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.760]   It always sounded interesting to me.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   Can I make a margin call?
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   Switch margin?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.520]   Maybe not a good idea.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.120]   Maybe not a bad idea.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.440]   Anyway, there is the latest from Apple.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.400]   How about the latest from Facebook?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   First quarter results for Facebook also out.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   Oh.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   Revenue 2.5 billion, up 72%.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   Wow.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520]   Wow.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520]   Quarter to quarter.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   Wow.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.520]   Wow.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.000]   I guess we're not shorting Facebook stock.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   You from advertising up 82%.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   Who's--
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   Wow.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.840]   Wow.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.920]   What other revenue do they have?
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.440]   Revenue was 2.5 billion.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.040]   Well, mobile versus desktop sales.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.320]   But it's all advertising.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   It's all advertising.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.800]   Yeah, what is that other quarter of a billion?
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   Where does that come?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   I don't know.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   Daily after users.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   Daily after users.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   Monthly active users 1.28 billion people.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.160]   That's a neat number to say.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.600]   Say anything over a billion as active users.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   Every month, one and a quarter billion people use Facebook.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.200]   Mobile daily active users, $609 million.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   Wow.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.040]   Daily active users overall $802 million.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.160]   So mobile went up a lot, 43% year over year.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.680]   Does daily really mean daily?
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.280]   I mean, every day of the month?
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   Every day.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   Woo.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   Wow.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.920]   Every day, 609 people use Facebook on mobile.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.640]   802 million use Facebook on mobile.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.240]   And newspapers run 12 page views per user per month.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.000]   And so visits per uses per month, often 1 to 3, 1 to 4.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.160]   Yeah, but this is users.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.480]   This is any, you know, this could be 20 pages.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   I know.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   That's what I was saying.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's amazing.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.520]   A newspaper which we supposedly depend upon for a healthy society.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.680]   Mobile advertising revenue.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.800]   And this is the metric I think everybody looks at with Facebook.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.920]   This was the thing they had to figure out.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.120]   They had to solve.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.880]   How do we get mobile advertising to work?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.520]   You know, they obviously licked it on the desktop.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.680]   But how do we get mobile advertising to work?
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   Mobile advertising revenue, 59% of the total advertising revenue.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.200]   That is incredible.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.640]   That's double what it was last year.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.840]   That's all.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.720]   And they're in the capitol seat there because Google is facing a, you know, a lot of you
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.840]   mention less, a lower yield on advertising because it goes to mobile.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.120]   So their picture can only look kind of worse in some ways because Facebook hadn't figured
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   it out.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.120]   Their picture is only going to look better.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.840]   And I don't know what the comparative yield is or any of that, but Facebook is only going
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   up.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.120]   Uh, confirmation that the CFO is stepping down.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.920]   We knew that he's been there five years.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.520]   He'll be succeeded by David, uh, David Warner.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.280]   David Ebersman is being succeeded by David Wenner, who is currently vice president corporate
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   finances.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.800]   This is like that moment on, on, on the Oscars when the accountants come out.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.080]   Most people just couldn't possibly get over the CFO.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.960]   Yeah, Abercrombie and Fritschburg.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.040]   Uh, so very interesting.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.320]   They're having a conference call right now or will in 10 minutes, I guess, uh, to talk
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:07.920]   about it, but a very good, very, I mean, boy, you couldn't get much better than that
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.360]   in terms of Facebook results.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.280]   So the two, the two big quarterly results we expected today, both Apple and Facebook doing
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.960]   what was the street expecting for Facebook?
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   Does it say there?
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   I haven't, I don't see that.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   Sorry.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.160]   I keep asking these stupid questions that are.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   You were doing research.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   What do you want?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160]   What do you want?
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   Come on.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:38.520]   Um, so both Facebook and, uh, Apple, yeah, Facebook beat, uh, the, uh, estimates.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.640]   One billion users on small screens, um, it's quarterly earnings show it be expectations
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:54.960]   earning 2.5 billion, uh, 34 cents per share, Wall Street expected 2.36 billion and 24 cents
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   per share.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.120]   So a significant beat on Wall Street.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:05.000]   I don't, I, I, I know we're supposed to report this, but I don't understand why it matters
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.560]   what some guys guessed compared to what the actual result was, but because it's only because
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.840]   the stock will do next is whether that was built in.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   I understand.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   Oh, that's right.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   So the stock should go up.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   That's right.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:25.960]   The daily active users are is mind boggling and there's a, there's a breakdown, uh, here,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.480]   um, uh, by, uh, geography.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.200]   And so if you look at this graph, let me make it as big as I can here.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   If you look at this graph and for those of you listening, I'll kind of describe it.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.880]   US growth is fairly flat.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:47.240]   US and Canada is the dark stuff at the bottom from a 2012 to 2014, two years it went from
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.080]   129 million daily active users to 150 million active users.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:00.440]   The big growth is in Asia massive growth, 119 million to 216 million, somewhat less
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.520]   in Europe, but still growth there and the rest of the world.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.040]   Big growth there.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.160]   So that's what you want to see.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.960]   If you're Facebook, you want to see big international growth.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   Oh, he's Brian drones.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   Big international growth.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Right.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   Right.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   Um, this does explain the drones.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.440]   Boy, does it ever be?
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:24.600]   I wasn't, yeah, because because if he gets that kind of level of daily, daily usage, find
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.520]   a way to give away the access.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.880]   Fine.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.520]   Come on, folks.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.000]   You'll be listening with interest to see, you know, a little more detailed things like
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.840]   young people versus older people, things like that.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.040]   Um, wait, uh, it'd be hard pressed to find any bad news in this.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:50.440]   So the proportion of US usage now is what, like on that chart, Leo, if you do it proportionally.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   What?
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.280]   Well, it's, you know, it looks like a 150 of 802.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.800]   It's, it's what is that?
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   It's not.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.360]   It's eight, no American company.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   No more.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   It's like 25.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   That's not even 25%.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.040]   Notice how good we are at math.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.080]   It's between 20 and 25.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.320]   No, no, it's less than 20.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   It's less than 20%.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   Wow.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   I always make my students.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   Wow.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.200]   Let me get my wrap by less than 20% of Facebook users are in the US and Canada.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.960]   And so all the talk we hear here.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.800]   Oh, you have talked about Facebook anymore?
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   None of us.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   Does it matter?
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.600]   Does it matter?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.800]   Meanless.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.200]   This is an international global company, global usage, which has always been part of Mark's
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.200]   vision.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   Less.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   Let me say this again.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.560]   Fewer than 20% of Facebook users are in the US and Canada.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.280]   80%, it's something like 82% of all Facebook users are outside US and Canada.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   Wow.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   What?
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.200]   Oh, that explains WhatsApp as well.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   My friend, Rafael E, now founder of Skift, says that every single member of his family
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.560]   is on WhatsApp, everybody in India.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.120]   That's because of text messaging being.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.320]   In fact, I saw some great pictures from India of women wearing saris with the WhatsApp logo
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   on it.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.400]   Those wonderful, beaded things that they do in India.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.640]   They're so wonderful with the WhatsApp logo on it.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.080]   It's part of the culture.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   Wow.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   Wow.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.600]   More than 80% of Facebook usage is outside the US.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:30.520]   You know, Facebook is quite amazing because every single market its energy is just suddenly,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   you know, taken over.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.200]   So it started at Harvard and dominated.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.760]   Within a few days it dominated the Harvard student body.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   Right?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760]   And it was like instant.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.960]   Then they go to all the IVs.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.280]   You know, they open up to all the universities in the Ivy League and it's immediately.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.680]   And then they open to all universities.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.520]   And almost immediately dominant.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.080]   Then they open the United States, almost, you know, just astounding growth.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   And then the same thing seems to have happened globally.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.200]   You know, what we need to do is discover some more planets.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.440]   Well, no, what he's doing is discovering new apps.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.960]   And I think it's very, A, WhatsApp is very telling.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.800]   B, he was interviewed at The New York Times by Farhad Manjur.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.960]   I thought that was a great interview.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   It's a very good interview.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.760]   And most telling thing to me was that Mark is breaking up the app.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.920]   And as I thought about that, I'm thinking about that in my context for journalism.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   We think everybody's going to come to our big thing that gives you everything you need,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   right?
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.960]   I think about how you use Google.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.320]   I go to things that are appropriate to the use.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.880]   I do Gmail over here.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   I do maps over there.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   I do this over there.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   I do that.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   Right?
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   So what's happening with Facebook?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   I do friend stuff here.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   I do photos there.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.120]   I do chatting here.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.460]   And so you start to break up not because these become holy new worlds, but because they're
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.080]   appropriate to the context of my life and what I'm doing at this minute.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.920]   He says we're unbundling the big blue app.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   Exactly.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.160]   That's really important.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.480]   So what is he really in Mark's genius, huge vision?
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   He's people connecting.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.720]   It's where he always wanted to be.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   That's what he's doing.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.240]   Every way he can get people connect.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.720]   That's where he is.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   Google is about people getting information.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.600]   And they're trying to do that every way, damn where they can.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.800]   And if they each hold true to that vision, they each have good, incredible, good businesses.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.600]   What we want to do is build a pipeline.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.800]   This is Mark Zuckerberg talking to Farhad Manju in the Times.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.520]   What we want to do is build a pipeline of experiences for people to have.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.640]   It would be a mistake to compare any of them in different life cycles to other ones.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   They're in different levels.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.920]   They're all different.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:35.640]   And you know, it's really interesting because there does seem to be, there are two different
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.960]   things trends you see.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.800]   One is to bundle everything into all in one, right?
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.720]   Like let's make the mobile phone do everything.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.400]   The mobile phone was condensing an iPod, a phone, a computer into one item.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.120]   And it seemed the conventional wisdom was, yeah, people just want one item.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.320]   But then you look at software, you look at Unix where the philosophy is do everything.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.240]   One thing well, but and very important, you can chain them together to do one bigger thing.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.240]   Yes.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.760]   And you can have a relationship across them, right?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.160]   Which is also the strategy.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.840]   So Mark doesn't even care about the Facebook brand necessarily.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.200]   So these things will not be called Facebook.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.960]   So making it truly a platform development.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   The other thing you can see about Mark is when he opened up Facebook outside the developer,
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.640]   isn't that that worked and then didn't work, right?
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.520]   But what is paper?
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.120]   Paper is saying there is a basis here of content and relationships.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.360]   And you can build an incredible new app on top of that.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.880]   The same thing that Facebook is built on and get an entirely different experience from
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.360]   it.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.560]   And so what ties it together?
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.640]   It's these companies' knowledge about you as a person, if we can get past all the creepy
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.760]   stuff and services.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   So once again, if you understand this, Gina, this idea of do one thing well, but then create
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.120]   a pipeline.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.280]   And Zuck is obviously, he's a programmer.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.800]   He knows Unix well.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.400]   He knows Linux well.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.560]   So when he says now, let's hear that quote again.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.800]   What we want to do is build a pipeline of experiences for people to have.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   So what is Facebook?
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.480]   It's a bunch of different apps, but we are the pipeline.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   We're the--
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.640]   The key though to the Unix pipe is that it can pass data, right?
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.320]   And so now, if you look at Google, they're a little farther along than Facebook, right?
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.560]   And Google had all these sort of different apps, right?
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.880]   And then they introduced the unified privacy policy that said that these apps can share
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.720]   this data across them.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.960]   And we're getting better experiences out of that, like Google now.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.480]   Facebook isn't there yet, right?
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.760]   Like Instagram and WhatsApp, those data sources are at least with WhatsApp.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.720]   And they're saying that that data is not shared back to Facebook, right?
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.640]   That they're not mixing that data.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.200]   That doesn't seem like very, very loudly.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.240]   That's true, but does he need to, Gina?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.920]   In the case of Google, Google lives and dies on relevance.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.040]   And relevance means knowing you and knowing what you want and who you are and all this
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.880]   stuff about you, right?
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.560]   Facebook, if it's just connecting you appropriately to the app, does what you do and WhatsApp really
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.960]   have to be that tied to Facebook?
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.800]   Listen to what he says, because then Maund you asked him about anonymity, about Snapchat
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.000]   and so forth.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.400]   He says, do you expect Facebook will do things with anonymity?
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.960]   Because of course, anonymity is antithetical to this idea of let's share all the data across
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   the pipeline.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.760]   Mark says, I don't know.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:24.880]   I do think more private communication is a bigger space than people realizing, but anonymity
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   is different.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.360]   I'm not going to say it can't work because I think that's too extreme.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.240]   But I tend to think some of these interactions are better rooted in some sense of building
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240]   relationships.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.720]   Which is what he really believes.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   He wants to grow.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   Identity and relationship.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.600]   It happens to go inside with his business model.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.720]   But yeah, there are different forms of identity you can use to form a relationship.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.040]   You can use your real edit any.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.560]   You can use phone numbers for something like WhatsApp, pseudonyms for something like Instagram.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.760]   But in any of those, you're not just sharing consumer content.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.600]   You're building relationships with people and building an understanding of people.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.680]   That's core to how we think about the world.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:09.520]   So, and this is the important point, anonymity is not the first thing we'll go do or ever
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   do.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.720]   He did do poke, which was like Snapchat, right?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.520]   Was it poke was anonymous?
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.520]   You could anonymously.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.520]   No, right?
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   No, because it was your Facebook identity.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.920]   But you could get, but didn't the things disappear after time?
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   I don't know.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   I never used nobody did.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.840]   I didn't know long.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   Longer exists.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   So who cares?
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   Farhad said you're 30.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.880]   Do you feel like you're in touch with the younger audience?
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   Well, because here's another question for you.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:50.360]   If your Twitter is bored and you look at those results, what are you thinking?
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.520]   Where does Twitter fit into that?
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   We know what Google is.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   We know what Facebook is.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.160]   I think there's a really significant issue for Twitter, which is that what was it?
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.840]   40% of people on Twitter never post ever.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.440]   Now on the other hand, I'm watching last night.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.480]   I'm watching The Voice.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:16.000]   And you know how those shows used to do text us with a hashtag or rather with your vote?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Right.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Now they just use Twitter.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.320]   Hashtag, save, leeir, whatever her name is.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.560]   And boy, that's brilliant.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.560]   It's good for Twitter.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.520]   It's good for the show.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.560]   Well, the only little bit of a little way.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.440]   You know, these newspapers, I don't know, only 1% of the people who touch them ever
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   write anything.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.360]   You know, Twitter is a publishing platform.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   Is Twitter a newspaper?
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   Is it?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.560]   So I guess that's what it is, right?
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.720]   The same blogger.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.440]   How many people read blogger versus how many people write on blogger?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   That doesn't bother me.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.160]   And I think Twitter hasn't done something that necessarily done a good job of answering
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   that back.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.720]   Publishing platforms are historically always have been more red than written.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.560]   But I thought that the idea of Twitter was it was a more egalitarian.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:06.520]   A much more, yes, more, much, much more than any publishing platform ever.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.000]   Yeah, I mean, if 60% of users who read a newspaper were printing stuff, winning stuff
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.200]   even the newspaper, that would be a very different kind of newspaper.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.800]   So you're right, 60% of Twitter users post.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.080]   Although the 40%, we don't know how many of those are real.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.720]   That's another issue with Twitter is.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.640]   A huge number of it seems to be fake accounts.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.120]   But they do a good job.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.960]   You know, the funny thing is when I see one, I report it all the time constantly.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:38.080]   Partly because it gets it out of my feed, but also because it's so easy to do.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.920]   And I don't see that many.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.800]   I mean, that's me.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.720]   But I think they kill them pretty well.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   They probably do a good job.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   I don't know.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.080]   I have my doubts about how quickly they could they or they have a capacity to actually kill
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.880]   accounts that are playing that behavior.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.880]   Is there a way for an else?
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   Fake accounts.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.040]   You don't know what else is on that, Gina?
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.080]   On how many users you blocked or?
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:13.360]   Well, no, is there a way kind of the sea based on blockings, how many fake accounts
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.720]   seem to pop up in people's feeds?
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.840]   I mean, you'd have to collect your data kind of over time.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.640]   Like I've got a pretty big database of Twitter users at this point because I've been running
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.280]   think up for many years.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.600]   And so at some point, you know, you check the user and it's a spender.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.560]   It doesn't exist anymore.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.640]   So you can do that kind of analysis kind of after the fact that you have to be collecting
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.600]   those users in a kind of over time and then checking back in on them.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.480]   And there isn't an easy way right now to say what happened to the users that I blocked.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.040]   But I was just having this conversation on Twitter recently with a couple of women who
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.560]   are being harassed and who are blocking people, then asking their friends to block these people
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.680]   users who are harassing them.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.600]   And by the time I had seen the conversation, which was the next day, they actually were
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.200]   suspended, which makes me really happy.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.480]   But they were complaining like, oh, you know, there's no way for just a regular user who
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.440]   doesn't have a ton of followers who isn't verified, who's getting harassed to really
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:14.000]   get sort of get Twitter's attention because there's just so many of these that just,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.480]   you know, you know, I was thinking about this the other day because I have adopted a new
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.000]   policy that if anybody says something, I don't mind criticism on Twitter, but I was
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   getting, you know, such ugly stuff on Twitter.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.280]   I just decided if somebody says something really ugly about me, I just block them.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   So I don't, I don't see it.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.440]   I mean, I, there's still can, but I don't see it.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.440]   Right.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.280]   And what I realized is if I block about, and it's only about 15 people, Twitter is a wonderful
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.000]   place all of a sudden.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.440]   It is a small, small percentage of the total that can occupy so much of the content by
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.200]   just tweeting a lot.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.760]   And I just, I have a much better experience on Twitter.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.200]   So I encourage people block, block, block.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.400]   Now I'm getting somebody blocked globally on Twitter.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   That's another matter.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.040]   I don't take those signals seriously.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.040]   I'm sure.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.840]   Yeah, but I don't even care about that.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.400]   I mean, I, you know, I mean, I, I believe in the person's right to say bad things about
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   Leo.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   I just want to read it.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:16.960]   Is it, if a tree falls in a forest and no one, if a troll, if a troll falls in a forest,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.800]   no one hears him.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.720]   Does it matter?
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.200]   So, so those women who have been harassed on Twitter, it wouldn't be, it's not sufficient
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.040]   for them to just block it so they don't see it.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.040]   Or is it?
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   Well, it's a couple of things.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.000]   I mean, I mean, sometimes it's like they're getting docked or they're getting, you know,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   harassing pictures.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.400]   And it's not, it's not just enough to say, I don't want to see this anymore.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.600]   It's, it's, it's straight up like this person should be banned.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.920]   I don't want anybody to have to see this as anyone else to see this, right?
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.960]   So, so, so there's that.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:55.800]   And, you know, a lot of it is just, you know, this feeling of that there should be consequences
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.400]   for, for harassing, you know, for harassing speech.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   And, you know, look, the lines around that are really, really blurry.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.440]   And you know, what constitutes, you know, criticism versus harassment versus, you know,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.920]   it's considered a legal threat.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.720]   But I think, I think there's definitely some frustration.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.080]   I think that, that sometimes it feels like Twitter airs on the side of, you know, protecting
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.440]   harassers over the people getting harassed.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.760]   Like, when they change their block policy and they actually want to be reverting the change,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.080]   they changed it so that, you know, you wouldn't see the person harassing you, but the person
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.000]   harassing you could still see your stuff.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.280]   And it was kind of like protecting the harasser versus the victim and then, and then Twitter
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   reverted it.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   So it's tricky.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   It's tricky.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.600]   It's not an easy problem to solve.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.960]   And it's really easy to just make another Twitter account and harass the person from
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   another name, you know, right?
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.400]   See our story last week about, about, you know, the trolls really are a little sick.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.880]   They're saying this, they're saying this.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.200]   But it's so easy to block people, at least in Tweetbot.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.400]   I just, I, it's given me great satisfaction.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.040]   And now I don't ever see any.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.440]   Yeah, I'm very liberal.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.280]   I'm very liberal with the block as well.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.480]   I've always said that.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.200]   Be liberal with your following and even more liberal with your unfollowing and/or blocking.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.120]   And you can create a Twitter feed that's marvelous.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.920]   And I'm not going to tell you, I mean, I follow a lot of people.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.840]   I follow over a thousand people, but I have this private list of people whose tweets, you
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.120]   know, none of, you know, I just don't want to miss.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.200]   And even just kind of changing that up.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.720]   I mean, I'm really like in real life.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.520]   Oh, I use this.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.320]   Or just like really just loud or noisy or just whatever annoying on Twitter.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   I just move them out of my list and they kind of fly by.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   Exactly what I do.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.040]   And that makes a much, much better experience.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.240]   I need to do that because I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   So I need to.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   It's unusable at that level.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.720]   Yeah, I have a, I have a public media walks list.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   And that's my main list.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.640]   I have some other lists too, but that's my main one.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.200]   And those are the ones I don't want to miss.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   I have lists.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   I just, I never think of clicking on them.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.840]   I think there's something to Dunbar's number.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.600]   Like I really think that there is a limit to how many people you can really pay attention
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.160]   to and keep a narrative in your head about.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:11.840]   On the other hand, I just love the kind of the serendipity of just having a 2,000 person
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.880]   Twitter stream where it's just, you know, there's all sorts of stuff in it.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   Right.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   And then fly and I love that.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.040]   I mean, it's just, you know, I never know what I'm going to see.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   It's just fun.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.440]   So, but that's why you do it in a list instead of unfollowing.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   I like that.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   I'm going to create some lists.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   Right.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   Because there's a social connection.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.400]   Because someone, it's, you know, folks get upset and some people I want to follow and
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.840]   I just want to follow casually.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.680]   I just want to kind of want to dip in and out what I want.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.360]   I don't need to hear every single tweet about their cat or whatever.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.720]   Does somebody know if you've blocked them?
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.840]   Is that, do they get a message you were just blocked?
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   No, probably not.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   I don't believe so.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   Maybe that would help.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   Maybe not.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.840]   You can't look it up.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   You can't look it up.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.840]   You can't look it up.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.480]   I feel like that would, in the case of a troll or a grief or something that would really
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.840]   aggravate the person and just motivate them to make another account.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.280]   Let them just shout into the darkness.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.360]   Although I believe if you block someone, then they can't follow you.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.720]   So then they do know, right?
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.560]   Because they'll just stop seeing your stuff.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.600]   So actually they do know.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.040]   By the way, Jeff, to kind of sort of answer your question, not about iPads, but about
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.880]   Mac and Tush's.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.880]   I'm monitoring the Tim Cook's phone call right now.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:34.520]   Apple is gaining PC market share and making OS 10 Mavericks free, led to the largest ever
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:39.040]   percent of installed Mac users using the latest version.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.560]   Because PCs are dying.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.240]   So they're going up, even everybody else.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.840]   Well, everybody's going down.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.000]   Here's another question about the mobile numbers for Twitter.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.080]   These two thirds of iPad users are new to iPad.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.400]   Two thirds of iPad buyers are new to iPad.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.520]   Half of iPhone buyers are new to iPhone.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   Those are very good numbers.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.520]   That's what you want.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   That is good.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.240]   We talk mobile mobile too often.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   Mobile includes tablets.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.320]   I think that's the misnomer because you're sitting on your couch.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.640]   So are the mobile numbers for Facebook?
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   Does that indicate that some proportion of people just aren't even using laptops now
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.640]   and they're using tablets?
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.520]   I think you're saying the tablet sales are kind of going down and I don't know how to
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   read that.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   It's just me.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.920]   I mean, look, you have a desktop.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   I have a desktop.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.400]   You have a desktop, Gina.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.800]   But when we go on Facebook two thirds of the time, we do it on our phone or our tablet.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.320]   Or a tablet.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.200]   But I guess I would guess phone.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   I don't install the app.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:41.400]   I just use the web view now on Android because I can't do it all as permissions.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   You're right.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.040]   It asks for everything.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.320]   It asks for once the world.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.600]   Web browser works.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.200]   That's a really interesting point.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   The new app is getting more and more stripped down.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.000]   They're taking messages out.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.920]   It's getting simpler and simpler and simpler.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.680]   Break it up the big blue app.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.760]   They really are doing that.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.640]   And so in a way, it's kind of nice because it's very clean and simple.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.880]   So the essence of Facebook, if he has all these other apps out there, the essence of
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:17.160]   Facebook itself, big momma Facebook is what?
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.160]   Managing friend.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.000]   That's a good question.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Content.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.280]   But communicating, you're going to do elsewhere.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.640]   I would say the news feed has been up to now the heart of it, right?
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   Yes.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   Yes.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.560]   I think that becomes the heart of it.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.600]   Facebook is content and communication is other things.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   That makes sense.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.960]   What I should also point out is that Facebook dominates in social login.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:48.320]   You know the Facebook Connect versus say Google Plus, it's Facebook.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:53.200]   And that is more a measure of how you're, I think that's kind of the future of Facebook,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   right?
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   It's the connector.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   It's the pipeline.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.920]   That's also just because Facebook Connect, I think, was first to market with that.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.760]   That is so damn convenient.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.160]   Well, given the choice, I always use Google instead of Facebook.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.600]   It's not the choice, but it's rare that I see the choice.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   That's interesting.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   I've got to get a new light.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.760]   Although I got to say on Android, the Google login is obviously way easier, right?
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   Right.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   It just does it, right?
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.960]   You don't have to do anything else.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.920]   Well, but doesn't Facebook do the same thing?
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.960]   Well, you don't know because you don't have the app.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   You can log in.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.720]   I mean, it just, it pops open a web view and I have to log in or whatever.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.320]   But see, that's not easy.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.720]   But if you have the app installed, you can use both bad equally easily, I think.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.000]   It will just, it does give you permissions and you do okay.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   I don't remember what Google does.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   I guess it does the same thing.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   It says, "Allow."
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   You have to allow it.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.880]   It'll ask you what permissions and you say allow it.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.680]   I've got two Google accounts on my phone, so it'll ask me which one.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.440]   I tap which one and then I'll say this game.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:01.040]   Usually it's games these days, but you know, what, you know, we want to post your circles.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.920]   It's just private to you to keep the goodness out.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.240]   Know your email address and you're just like, "Okay."
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.400]   And you're good to go.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.840]   Gina Trappani, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.040]   We're talking about anything we want to talk about.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.440]   I don't even know how I'd quantify this now.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:27.120]   Quarterly results, Facebook, Google, Twitter.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.480]   Did we answer, did we talk about, did we really answer that question?
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.960]   What's the central experience of Facebook?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   Well, newsfeed, right?
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   Newsfeed.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.400]   Newsfeed for now, but not for the long term, I don't think.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.960]   Facebook is just about that social sixth sense, you know.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   It's like sort of knowing what's going on with my acquaintances in a way that I wouldn't
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.760]   have beforehand.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.800]   Our show today brought to you by 99designs.com.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   Have you seen our new t-shirt?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.320]   Go to teespring, d-w-e-s-p-r-i-n-g.com/twit.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.640]   This was a design we got from 99designs.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.080]   If you're in a business, you need great design.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.840]   More than a quarter million, actually almost 300,000 graphic designers are waiting to talk
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.120]   to you at 99designs.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   We put up a contest.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.520]   We said we wanted to do a hoodie.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.320]   We got a bunch of really great designs.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.120]   We ended up buying five.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.280]   This was one of them.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.360]   We did the hoodie last month.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.200]   We're doing the t-shirt this month.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.360]   I love this design.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:29.120]   In fact, it looks great on a black tee or a white tee, which I think is one of the reasons
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   we chose.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.560]   It's just a tank.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.000]   There's a spaghetti strap for the ladies.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.080]   There's a woman's tee for the ladies as well, as well as the men's.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   What's it called?
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   A gildan.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   I don't know what a gildan.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.520]   That's a tank top, I guess.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.840]   Twenty dollars.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.720]   If you want to get our t-shirt and thanks so much to 99designs.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.840]   We have designers in-house, but it's so great to get the different looks, the different
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.040]   ideas.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.960]   If you haven't updated your website's design lately, does the layout serve the needs of
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.960]   your business?
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.680]   Can visitors find what they need?
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.880]   Remember simplicity and navigability are your friends, and that's what designers are so
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.840]   good at.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   Trying to view your site through the eyes of a new visitor.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.880]   Are there barriers to use to the screens flow logically from one of the next to all the
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.760]   tabs and buckets and burgers and sliders and buttons?
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   Work as they should.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.080]   Can customers get a hold of you?
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.880]   Can they buy if you're selling?
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   If you find something annoying, a first time visitor will for sure too.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.600]   But site design is so important, and that's exact-look at that.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   That's nice.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.600]   I like that.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   Q feeder.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.680]   That's a 99designs design.

[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.560]   And then designers give you some ideas.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.720]   You can work with them.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   Refine it.

[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.640]   Today we couldn't be more happy with the designs we get from 99designs.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.720]   I love this t-shirt.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.880]   I shall send you both one.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   Speaking of design...
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   I like that design a lot.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   Isn't that great?
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.760]   Apparently Google, according to an interview with John Konstein at TechCrunch, Google's going
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:02.000]   to focus on design at the Google I/O this year.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   What?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.840]   That's with the big sigh.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.240]   What is with the big sigh?
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.360]   Because if you have to announce that you're focusing on design, I love you Google.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   You know that I do.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   But if you've done now, you're going to focus on design.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   You're going to say that it's critical.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360]   But...
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.360]   I hate to be critical.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.200]   Marco actually did a post on this.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.600]   And whatever Marco is, Marco, he's very pro-apple and not so generous with the Google.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.760]   But I got to say, I think he was kind of spot on here.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   And I don't know.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.080]   I might be risking my chance at a Google I/O pass.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.000]   But it just, it feels...
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.200]   I don't think that you can have a thrust on design, one particular cycle of development,
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   right?
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.360]   That just has to be embedded in your whole entire process and in the values of the company.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.840]   And I don't think that Google's there.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.120]   I think that they're getting there.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   But I don't know.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.920]   When I saw that they're going to focus on the not design at I/O, part of me thought,
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   "Oh, that's great."
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.800]   And another part of me thought like design has to be part of every single I/O, every
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.840]   single product.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.160]   Every bit of development.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.240]   And I think design is one of the most overused words right now.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.240]   I hear it constantly.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:14.000]   And what it means often to people is, "Let's get out the Post-it notes."
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Design thinking.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.600]   Oh, I hate design thinking.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.600]   Right.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.240]   And design thinking and design, I think, are not only separate things.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.880]   One is use of aesthetics and the other one is listening to people.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.200]   And listening to people is a good thing and it's an input.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.360]   But everybody's got nuts saying it's all about design, design, design.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.840]   And I think it's being overused now and it comes to mean less.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.440]   However, somebody who believes in this told me a few weeks ago that IBM is hiring designers
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   like crazy.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.480]   I think I said this in the show because they think that the technology is going to get
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   easier and easier, but experience is what matters.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   You can blame I/O and David Kelly for all of this.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.240]   And the Stanford D School.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:00.760]   So I/O kind of, it's hard for me not to be cynical about it.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.160]   Everything run out of people for whom it could design actual things for.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.400]   It decided that design applies to everything we do in life.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.320]   And we know how to do it.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.040]   It's just expanding the market.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.040]   You're right.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.040]   What does that mean?
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.200]   I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:28.600]   Well, it does look basically I/O and I think it's primarily Kelly, but their thinking was
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:34.080]   these principles of design should be applied to everything, including how an organization
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:41.320]   is run, how meetings are run, how you experience buying a hamburger, everything.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.560]   And the example they use as a good example is if you're designing a hospital, you better
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:52.000]   lie on a gurney and look at the ceiling because that's what your patients are seeing.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.800]   And that's a good point.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.400]   I don't think it's a bad point.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:02.600]   But then I've been in these meetings or these sessions where they design thinking and it's
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.160]   I don't know, it feels a little cultish, frankly.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   It's weird.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.760]   I mean, isn't design just a code word for thoughtfulness and empathy?
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   And they've got a methodology.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.240]   Basically, they have a methodology that they want you to use.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   And it's good.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:21.120]   It's brainstorming and free form and how to then incorporate that into actual planning.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.440]   And I guess it's okay.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.960]   I'm allergic to some of that stuff.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.640]   I'm like a New Yorker in that regards to Kellogg.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   But it becomes jargony.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.560]   I mean, I think there's something to it.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.040]   I mean, I'm doing a lot of work now on engagement and journalism and listening to the community
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.400]   before you think you know what they need.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.680]   That's the essence of design thinking.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   It's cultural anthropology.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   It's watching people.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.360]   It's just turning their needs.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.880]   I agree with all that.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   But you're right.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:53.360]   I think really putting it in this marketing shell turns it into a cliche-ridden high.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:58:00.000]   So Marco writes, "The idea that Google needs to attract designers to win against iOS is
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.760]   misguided at best.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:07.280]   A software platform's UI and design ethos can't be changed on a whim by conference sessions
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.800]   and a marketing push.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.960]   It's deeply ingrained, built over the platform's entire lifespan and very slow to change."
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:19.320]   See, I would disagree with Marco in that respect because the first Android phones were admittedly
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:25.440]   a nightmare.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.960]   Everything felt very cobbled together.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.440]   But over time, Android has become much more polished.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.080]   And that's because Google has pushed it there.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:40.280]   I think, holo and everything that they've done, they have set a tone and a standard.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.240]   Just as Apple did by the way, Marco, the reason Apple's got it is because Apple imposed it
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.800]   from day one with a Macintosh.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.320]   I would argue, and I'll get an email about this too, but don't bother people, is the
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:58.440]   single best design in the history of the net was the original Google homepage.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.600]   There you go.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.000]   Here's a box, the world's behind it.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.400]   It was a design that was undesigned.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   Exactly.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:09.040]   And Marco says the thing that has become a cliche-ed can't.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.360]   Android's best apps usually aren't as good as iOS's best apps because, and this is the
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.960]   part I disagree with.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.160]   People who value and demand the best apps overwhelmingly choose iOS.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.360]   Well, that's really old-fashioned thinking.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   That's not true anymore.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.520]   We're better than you because we have iPhones.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.520]   That's just so...
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   Marco.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   Yeah, no, he's wrong about that.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:34.600]   But I do think that he's right about the design being part of the culture from the beginning.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.240]   And Android's approach is so different than Apple, right?
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.720]   It was like, put it out even if it's dirty and broken and we'll fix it later, whereas
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.080]   Apple would be like, if it's not ready, it doesn't go out, right?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.520]   We're not going to put out copy and paste until we have it perfectly right.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.440]   And you're just going to live without copy and paste, you know, the rest of the time.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.360]   But the difference there is we're going to define what right is versus Google says the
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.600]   public's going to define what right is.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.440]   That's, I think, the fundamental difference.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.240]   Apple's willing to be totally authoritarian.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   Yes.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   Absolutely.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   So, hi, and Google is not.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   Google says, well, we want choice.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.480]   That's exactly right.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.440]   And we're not willing to say to lay down the loan.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.000]   We will encourage people to use Holo, but we won't make them use Holo.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   And we'll have it.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.640]   We'll have a methodology of A/B testing.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   And we listen to signals.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   We're data driven.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   That's what was.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   We're data driven.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.200]   Apple says we're Steve has been.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.680]   We're, you know, I mean, and there and there lies it's we and strengthen now it's weakness.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:31.200]   There lies the reason for a several one stock split and a buyback and a dividend up.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.120]   Although as we found out in the Samsung Apple trial and the revelations there, Apple did,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.360]   in fact, use focus groups.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   They encouraged the opinion, the feeling that it was all Steve.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   But they in fact did some research.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.320]   Well, they always do research.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.840]   These guys do ethnographic research.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.160]   That's part of the process is to watch people in their environments and what they do and
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.160]   try to solve problems.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.880]   And that's a form of listening.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:05.320]   But I for one choose the free form sometimes messy Google way over the authoritarian way.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.400]   Yes, the trains run on time, but it's not a good feeling.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.520]   And you know, I think both approaches have their have their strengths and weakness.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520]   Yes.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   And you have your choice.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.880]   I mean, I know a lot of designers who would say, you know, designing by data is insane.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.960]   You know, I forget the name of that designer who was at Google and said, you know, they
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.480]   the A B tested every shade of blue, right?
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.600]   Whereas as a designer, I couldn't say this is the right time, you know.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.660]   So I see I see both sides there and there are strengths and weaknesses weaknesses to
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.660]   both.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:42.980]   But, you know, design was definitely not at the forefront of Google's mind when they
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.520]   were pushing out Android.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.060]   Part of that is because they were doing it after the iPhone.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.300]   And that's just that's not part of the culture.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.300]   They're playing a quick catch up too.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.380]   Yeah, they're playing catch up.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.140]   Yeah, there are a lot of different factors.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.860]   And by the way, go to go to play.google.com and what is on the front page of the Google
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.300]   Store, the nest, one of the most beautiful designed things ever.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.820]   And Google bought the company.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.820]   I think Google doesn't hate design.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.060]   Google loves elegant, beautiful stuff.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.060]   Oh, definitely.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.060]   Right.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.900]   One of the few products that's in both the Play Store and the Apple Store as well.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.900]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.460]   I wonder how long that'll last.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.900]   Google, of course, owns nest.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.340]   I bought three nests at the Apple Store not so long ago.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.340]   Which are now bookends?
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.860]   Yeah, I don't use them anymore.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:36.100]   And when we moved, I didn't bother installing them because I didn't find it made that much
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.300]   of a difference.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:43.140]   And I really hated anything turning on the heat without my say so.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.260]   I just don't like the idea of a smart thermostat.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:51.900]   And by the way, I noticed Google's not selling the smart smoke detector.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.740]   No.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.940]   Oh, I think venture beat got this wrong.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   But maybe not.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.500]   They say Google is researching ways to put encryption in Gmail.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:08.060]   This article by Harrison Weber says that in response to Edward Snowden's mass surveillance
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:14.340]   revelations, Google's working on a way to put PGP into email.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.300]   This is from a source at Google.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.820]   They say venture beats source at Google acknowledge that end-to-end encryption is the best defense
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.900]   for message protection.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.140]   We know that though it comes at considerable cost and functionality.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.980]   I don't think it comes at a cost and functionality to the end user.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.980]   It's a pain in the ass to implement the cost and functionality is to Google, which can't
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.140]   see into your email and put ads in it.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:44.340]   So I wonder, I can't imagine this would be a real gut check for Google.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.020]   Google believes in right.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.780]   This is part of Google's ethos of privacy.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.740]   It believes encryption should be easy to do.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:56.140]   On the other hand, there is absolutely no ways to monetize and creepy about charging.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:01.900]   Have you ever ever ever seen money and seen figures on how much Google makes from ads
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.900]   on Gmail?
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.900]   No.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.940]   I think it's got to be minu--
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.940]   Interesting.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:13.780]   As we talked about the other day, I usually don't see ads, any, any on Gmail.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.420]   When I do, I'm engrossed in an activity.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.580]   Why do I use Gmail?
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.900]   Why does Google still want me to use Gmail?
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.660]   Even if it doesn't have direct revenue from it?
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.900]   Well, because it's part of the service--
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.460]   Gee, Google now.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.820]   It feeds all kinds of things.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.580]   I'm addicted to Google.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:34.100]   Why did I buy all my LaVita Google devices because of Gmail?
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.100]   Because it was integrated.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.940]   So Gmail has huge value to them.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.300]   I think they could stop advertising on Gmail tomorrow.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.940]   And I would bet you-- well, never know-- but I would bet you the impact on bottom line
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.740]   is to minimus.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.580]   So what's more important to Google?
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.580]   Trust.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.220]   Trust, trust, trust.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:59.540]   I'm going to speak to the privacy folks at Google in a few weeks, which is-- and I'm
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.020]   doing that as a favor.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.500]   So I don't know.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.540]   Maybe you might want to let Gina in, but we'll get a better--
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980]   --adds.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980]   I love you.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.900]   And I'd love to help from listeners of Twig.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.300]   And for this, you can send me an email.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.820]   Or you can talk to me the other way.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:24.180]   Is what would the perfect ultimate Google as the absolute leader in privacy look like?
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.580]   And I think that I want to give them a wish list about them.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.900]   It's just interesting because I don't see any ads at all.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.980]   Gina, do you see any ads in your Gmail?
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:33.980]   I do.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   I do.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.780]   So I turn off a little bar across the top.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.860]   If I open up a message, I have a related Google+ page--
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:41.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   There it is on the right.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   OK.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   And then on the right at the bottom.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   But they're very minor.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.660]   It doesn't bother me.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.220]   Here's a dotnet development.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.820]   This is not bad at all.
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.420]   This is an email from Jason.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.020]   I don't know.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.780]   If anyone can figure out how to--
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.100]   Sometimes they don't have anything.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.540]   Get these ads to show up with encryption.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.420]   It's Google.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.940]   Or just still know about you.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.140]   So here's a couple of options.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:11.580]   Right.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.980]   You could have ads that just aren't targeted.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.380]   Well, though, they're targeted to you.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.100]   They're just not from your email.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.580]   Why not?
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.860]   This is a hot button for a lot of people.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.580]   Get off the scrugal bandwagon.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.540]   Or charge $5 a year or whatever.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.860]   I mean, it's not-- I mean, it's not-- can't be--
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.100]   Well, this is what I was thinking.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.820]   Google Apps users who are paying businesses and organizations.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.940]   This is something that they want.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.340]   So that you pay for this premium service,
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.060]   you turn on privacy, and your communications are encrypted.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.380]   Now, your communications are all stored on Google servers.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.500]   And if the NSA or whoever is getting
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.300]   whatever coming in and out of Google servers,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.900]   then encryption doesn't do anything for you, right?
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.820]   Well, hold on.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.740]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.660]   No, if it's end to end encrypted, then it does.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.940]   Right.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.300]   Because--
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.860]   So I use a service called Hushmail right now.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.300]   Hushmail was created by Phil Zimmerman, who created PGP.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.620]   It's PGP encryption.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.420]   If you use it to go outbound outside of Hushmail,
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.020]   it's not encrypted anymore.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.300]   But if you're sending it to somebody within Hushmail,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.420]   it's fully PGP encrypted.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:15.900]   Right.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.820]   And that's what you would do.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.300]   But if Google did it, almost half the people
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:24.260]   I write to are on Gmail already, that would all be encrypted.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:28.980]   Well, let me explain this to me, because I get confused
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.940]   about encryption.
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:31.940]   It shouldn't be, but I still do.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:37.100]   So if it's end to end anywhere outside of Google,
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.300]   then I still have to publish a public key.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:44.940]   You would need to encrypt mail to me if I'm on Yahoo mail.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.460]   You would need to know my public key and encrypt it
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.460]   to that public key.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:48.960]   OK.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.900]   So now Google could make that easy by saying, oh, I see this
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.660]   is not a Gmail address, would you like to encrypt?
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.180]   And then is this the person to whom you're sending the mail?
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.420]   Does this match your knowledge of Jeff?
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:01.620]   OK, but here's another question.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.180]   Here's a clever way Google could do it.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.940]   We'll make it really, really easy to encrypt
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.900]   like Hushmail inside Gmail.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.540]   And because I don't know anybody who uses Hushmail,
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.620]   it's up to you, Leo.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.460]   But I know lots of people use Gmail.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.980]   And if you are concerned about this being private communication,
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:22.140]   hey, just find your user on Gmail and send it to them in Gmail.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.100]   And you don't have to worry about publishing these--
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:25.620]   That's right.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.980]   So that becomes a real premium service.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.300]   I don't know if it's something to charge for it,
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.220]   but I'm saying it becomes another benefit to using Gmail.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.460]   Now, here's a question.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.540]   It becomes the most secure place to email.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.420]   Would Google, if it did that, Google
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.900]   would have to hold your private key, right?
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.460]   Where would the private key live, Gina?
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.660]   Yeah, that's the question right.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.860]   It has to be--
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.260]   You could live on your hard drive.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:48.820]   You know--
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:49.500]   It's your client on your hard drive.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.860]   It could live in your client.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.820]   And then, yeah, I guess it could.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.660]   It could live in your client.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.540]   That's not the hard part.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.540]   The hard part is I want to send private email to Gina.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.100]   I don't know her public key.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.100]   I have to go looking for her public key.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.580]   Instead on Gmail, it says, Gina accepts encrypted mail.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.900]   Would you like to send something to her encrypted?
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.380]   Check here.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.820]   Yes, I would.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.020]   That's the hard part.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.380]   Made easier, right?
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.100]   Yes.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.300]   Yes, it knows your key and it has your public key,
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.900]   so it would do it automatically.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.660]   What Gmail could-- what Google could do in addition to that,
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.820]   just to play along here, is that it could make it a standard
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.660]   to make it really easy for anyone in Google+--
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.180]   Get this.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.580]   Get this.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.300]   Click one box and you get a public key.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.380]   And Gmail will use it automatically.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.180]   It'll put it in your Google profile.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.260]   It'll put your Google profile.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.300]   It'll put your public key there.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.020]   It'll put your private key in your Gmail.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.380]   And you're rolling.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.340]   So actually, I think that's the only way to do it.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.100]   Hushmail keeps the private key, which
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.420]   means that they have in the past turned over
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.060]   unencrypted emails to the federal government on subpoenas.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.140]   That's not the way to do it, obviously.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:56.620]   No.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.420]   And by the way, Levard LeDar Levison,
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:02.300]   who created LavaBit, the encrypted mail
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.540]   that reported LeDarLavison wanted a user, did use with Glenn
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.860]   Greenwald, he shut down LavaBit because the government
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.620]   was one of the keys.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.940]   And he said, no, I'm not going to do it.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.820]   He's now in a lot of trouble because of it.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.940]   But he and Phil Zimmerman are creating something they call
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.380]   darkmail that will presumably do it correctly.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.260]   The key is that to make it trust no one's in Steve Gibson's
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:27.700]   famous phrase, TNO, the only person who could have access
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.580]   to that private key would be you.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:33.060]   So that no other third party could turn over your unencrypted
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.340]   email.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.740]   And that's what we all want.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.020]   We all understand that now.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.500]   So all Google would do is maintain a directory of private
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.100]   keys automatically use that--
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.100]   I'm sorry, of public keys-- automatically use those
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.180]   public keys on your request to encrypt.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.620]   But it would not be able to decrypt.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.540]   Your client would have to do that in the window or whatever.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   Absolutely.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.340]   It gives you security and safety.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.060]   And he's always going to prevent the NSA from getting
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.140]   your phone unless they can--
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:58.660]   Exactly.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.060]   --incredibly do.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.540]   We don't know it, right?
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.140]   But yeah.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.900]   Thinking about this talk at Google, the other thing that
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.260]   occurred to me as I was walking the street the other day
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.940]   is that I think we're thinking about this personal data
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:11.580]   the wrong way.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:15.220]   We keep on talking about bolts, protect it, right?
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.460]   I think instead that what you really want to do is see that
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.220]   there is an economy here and a benefit of sharing your data,
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.020]   but you want more control over that.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.460]   When do you share something?
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.060]   So really a platform for being able to publish and share
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.780]   things and making that possible and getting me value in return
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.340]   is where I think this goes.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.100]   So this idea that you can encrypt something so easily in
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.740]   Gmail and keep it private from everybody including Google
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.900]   and the NSA, that's a powerful statement if that's what they're
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.180]   going to do.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.380]   And if you weren't thinking this way, you think it's a good idea?
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.580]   Well, invite Gina and me to IEL.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:52.020]   We'll explain it to you.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.060]   This would prevent them from doing all the cool Google
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.260]   now features though where it's like, oh, you were a flight
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.220]   coming up and you've just arrived at the airport.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.700]   Oh, your package is shipped.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.860]   So that's why I don't think--
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.340]   And I'm not going to--
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.900]   Well, the encrypt automatically.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.380]   They encrypt on request.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.340]   Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.740]   Because Gina also--
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.300]   United Airlines is not going to encrypt--
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:12.800]   Right.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.300]   That's incoming.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.380]   --that's incoming pass to me.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.740]   So that email's still there.
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.220]   Yeah, that doesn't change anything.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.260]   That doesn't change anything.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.820]   When you do talk to them, tell them that if they really
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:27.420]   want to get this right, nobody ever says the phrase public key.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   Amen.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.420]   Amen.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.620]   No, no writing to the person should have--
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.980]   ever I say the phrase public key.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.220]   But you have to treat it like the secret mailbox.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.380]   Gina, if you were only going to Google I/O,
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.860]   you could explain that to them yourself.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.780]   You could say that.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.580]   Too bad you won't be there.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.100]   Right, it's instead of a priority inbox,
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.540]   it's private mailbox, it's secret mailbox.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.620]   It's like, OK, you can send the postcard,
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.860]   or you're going to send it this certified mail.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.580]   Some sort of analogy that makes it easy to grok
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.420]   and no public private key.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.140]   I mean, LastPass does this, right?
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.860]   I mean, I installed the LastPass extension
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.660]   on all my different browsers.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.380]   When Heartbleed happened, LastPass said, hey, you know what?
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.420]   Even if our servers were vulnerable, all of your--
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.300]   we don't have your data.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.100]   We can't decrypt your data.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   I mean, they have my data, right?
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.780]   But it's encrypted.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.420]   So even if a hacker had been using Heartbleed,
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.180]   they wouldn't have been able to decrypt anything that they had.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.260]   This is what's going on, right?
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.500]   All my stuff is getting decrypted when
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.940]   I activate the extension on my client.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.140]   And this is basically how PGP works as well.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.340]   But I don't deal with keys with that.
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.060]   I just install it and log in.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.700]   Well, no, no, I also want to just note here,
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.100]   there's not just the IGO or Gina goes.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.780]   We've collaborated here together.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.860]   We're a team.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   You don't want to split us off.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.340]   That's the key to this.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.140]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.980]   Oh, it's hopeless.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.140]   Forget it, guys.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:00.740]   I know.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   I know.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.740]   We don't-- nobody pressures Google.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.740]   No.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.740]   We don't.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.740]   We don't.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.220]   I just want to say, we were thinking of trying to game Google
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.540]   by just signing up 100 people.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.300]   But I thought that probably was a foolish idea as well.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.820]   The gaming Google is probably the last thing anybody ever wants.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.620]   Well, right now, Matt Cut's ears are picking up.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.540]   Well, hey, in fact, next time we get Matt Cut's on,
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.620]   I want to just thank him.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:33.700]   Because I guess Google's cracking down on bogus inbound links
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.340]   or whatever.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.940]   Because I mentioned this before, tons of email from people
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.460]   saying, hey, we spammed your forums some time ago.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.740]   Can you remove that spam?
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740]   Because Google's cracking down on us.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.580]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.580]   It gives me such pleasure to send them back.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.260]   You know what?
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.180]   No.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.700]   That is the sound of my feet dragging.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.300]   One guy just sent me, we'll pay for whatever it takes
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.900]   to get rid of these spammy links.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.900]   Now, probably what happened in some of these cases,
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:09.820]   it's that they hired a kind of rogue SEO group that
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.340]   did these spammy links and they didn't know what maybe.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:15.740]   I'm going to give them a little benefit of the doubt on this.
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.140]   On the other hand, maybe not.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.700]   And the ones I really don't like are the ones who threaten
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.580]   me because we would hate to have to go back to Google
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:29.300]   and disavow the links because that would adversely affect
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.060]   your own Google ranking.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.380]   What?
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:32.780]   Threatening.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   Jerks.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780]   Jerks.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.820]   That was my-- that kind of was one of the words
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.820]   that came to mind.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:38.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.820]   Wow.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:40.820]   Wow.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.300]   We would hate to have to go back to Google
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.780]   and tell him he wasn't cooperating with us.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.660]   The nice horse you have.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.140]   Is a canole?
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.140]   He's a gun.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.980]   Can you believe that?
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   Wow.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.980]   Evil.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:00.300]   Yeah, I'm getting them almost every day now because I guess
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.420]   we have a forum that we set up, the Twit Town Commons.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.900]   And it's not widely used.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.580]   And of course, as soon as you have any place like that,
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.060]   spammers just glom onto it because they're hoping--
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.380]   because it's at twit.tv.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:17.700]   So they want to get our Google juice to their evil client
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.260]   or whatever.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:27.300]   Anyway, don't write to me because I'm not going to be--
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.540]   I'm not going to be a nice guy.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.300]   And Matt, if they try to smear me,
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:35.780]   I presume you won't affect our ranking,
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.860]   our beautiful friendship, our beautiful friendship.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   You've got to be on the complex.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.380]   I miss Matt.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.340]   We did get Matt back on.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.380]   Go to our ad.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.380]   Try and listen what happens with Matt.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.700]   Yeah, I'll talk to him.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.060]   Get the cut man on.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.060]   Send him in here.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.260]   He's such a sweetie.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:48.860]   I just--
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.220]   He's super-- yeah.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.220]   He really is.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:55.180]   Um, Google fights stunning erasure gag order
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.580]   on First Amendment grounds.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.500]   It's stunning.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.860]   Well, that's my word for stunning.
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.420]   What is this?
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.780]   Google fights gag order is from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.820]   So some guys said you got to take down all these lists
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:11.060]   about me on-- and Google, of course, says no.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.020]   We see these lawsuits all the time, right?
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.860]   But then a court said they had-- oh, now I can't--
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.540]   I can't read it because I'm not a subscriber
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.540]   to the Houston Chronicle.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.060]   Right, I read it was.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.300]   No, I can't read it because-- well, you know what?
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:21.780]   Never mind.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.700]   Houston Chronicle.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   You lose.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   You lose.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.220]   You lose.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.860]   I never mind the extra really else.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.020]   There's been a lot of them.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.940]   Who was the guy who was-- there was pictures circulating
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.540]   of him at an orgy, and he wanted Google to take him down?
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.940]   How about animated GIFs as high art?
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.540]   GIFs.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.060]   GIFs.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.140]   This is kind of cool.
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.540]   So London's famous Sachi gallery
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.540]   teamed up with Google+, for the Motion Photography Prize,
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.580]   the world's first competition for artists
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.780]   working with animated GIFs.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.100]   I have a wonderful colleague here at CUNY named John Smock,
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.300]   who was in charge of our photography.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.100]   And he wanted to teach animated GIFs.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.860]   And I just went after him for half an hour,
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.780]   saying to my god, this is the end of journalism,
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.460]   must be exploitation, aesthetics, everything
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.020]   that is wholly--
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.020]   You are wrong, sir.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:10.860]   Do that.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:11.780]   You are wrong.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.900]   This is Sachi Gallery.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.860]   London, England.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:21.700]   We showed during the last USA Open that I'd shot tennis players
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:25.460]   doing their things, and I admitted the errors of my ways.
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.300]   And now I've actually seen some cool--
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.340]   This one is the winner.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.180]   It is Brooklyn artist Christina Renaldi.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.540]   It's of a window washer.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.460]   And I presume it's just--
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.300]   I don't know if it's auto awesome gift,
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.140]   or if she did--
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.540]   I'm sure it's manually done.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.260]   Quite beautiful.
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.020]   It is beautiful.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.420]   There are some really nice ones of this.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:44.060]   Here's another one.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.860]   This is from Costas Aguianatis, a cinematographer
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.780]   from Rhodes, Greece.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:50.820]   You might say, wait a minute.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.540]   That's not animated.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.860]   But if you look closely, her hair
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.660]   is blowing in the wind as she looks at a--
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.180]   A record spinning.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:57.180]   --jukebox.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.700]   --a record spinning.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.540]   Oh, is the record spinning?
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.900]   Oh, yes it is.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.380]   So that is not what I call an animated gift.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.220]   This is what I call a cinemagraph.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.140]   Right.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.140]   But I guess the distinction is lost
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.140]   on the prestigious Sachi Gallery.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   I like that.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.940]   Cinemagraphs-- and there's an app that does this called
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:19.420]   cinemagraph, but there are other come apps that do it.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.180]   You can say, this part should be moving.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.660]   This part should be moving, but not the rest.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:26.620]   Here's a kind of beautiful one of a guy standing in a pool
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.340]   underwater.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.860]   And the reflections of the light-- he's not moving with it.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.980]   Again, a cinemagraph.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.620]   Unless I guess maybe he's just not moving.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:41.180]   This is for the artist Matthew Clark,
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.460]   shortlisted for the night category.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.900]   I don't know if I like this.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.380]   But you see a person walking by a fella sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.500]   And this fella's moving back and forth.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.740]   I like the pigeon.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.180]   Here's a pigeon from Mikhail Renau.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:19:59.540]   A pigeon--
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.780]   I want it noted that none of these winners have cats.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.260]   There are no cats.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.060]   No cats are on top.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.700]   In these animated gifts.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:08.540]   There are no cats.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:15.260]   I don't know what makes this special.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.540]   Anyway, this is an article from CNN.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.820]   I really do like the winner, though.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.420]   I think that's quite nice.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.220]   Because the patterns made by the soap
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.940]   suds as he wipes them off the window are quite interesting.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.860]   Now I'm going to start playing with it.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.460]   Is AutoWassom the best way to make an animated gift?
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.660]   No, it's better tools.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.820]   Because AutoWassom you don't control.
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.140]   You don't know which images you're going to use and all that.
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.340]   Because it's for you automatically.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.220]   I don't know.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.460]   But I should plug.
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.780]   And then I was like, which is from a former life hacker
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:45.660]   editor.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.980]   And then I was like.com.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:50.660]   It's selfie gifts.
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.340]   Selfies not selfies, right?
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.500]   That's mining too horrible.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.500]   Selfies.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.500]   It is.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.220]   You sit in front of your website.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.980]   It's.co.not.com.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.340]   It's.co.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:01.820]   Right, right.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.940]   So you sit in front of your webcam and you make a face.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.620]   OK, let me do it.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.420]   All right.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.420]   OK.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.380]   I'm going to do it through Google.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:09.380]   Why not?
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:10.380]   Yep, yep, yep.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   This is that Google login.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.380]   See how easy that is.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.380]   I love that.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.380]   So easy.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   All right, click a loud to turn on your webcam.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.380]   OK.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.580]   My webcam is now on.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.580]   OK.
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:22.780]   In the count of three, you have three seconds to record your gift.
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:23.780]   All right.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   Ready?
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:33.620]   All right, I've recorded a gift.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.620]   Come on.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.860]   Tell me that's not awesome.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.860]   OK.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:46.500]   Now you can have normal looping action or back and forth, which in this particular case,
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.460]   it doesn't really doesn't really matter.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.980]   This is made by Adam Pash.
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.220]   Adam Pash made this.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.220]   Uh-huh.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220]   Yeah, he did.
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:56.500]   This one is that a press again, Gina?
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500]   And then I was like that.co.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.500]   And then I was like that.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.500]   Co because it's supposed to be your reaction.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.500]   So things.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.500]   I do a jaw drop.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.340]   Shall I do a jaw drop?
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.340]   After it's done saving.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.700]   So that's the-- that we were talking about the other day is the react that instead of
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.700]   shooting--
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:13.700]   Come on.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.700]   Isn't that fun?
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.700]   I like that.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.700]   I want to do a jaw drop.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.500]   And now I want to do another one.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.540]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, three seconds.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:30.180]   Did it get it?
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.180]   No.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.180]   What happened?
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.180]   It's just a precaption.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.180]   It's just a precaption, I think.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   Oh, it was a caption.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.180]   OK.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.180]   Let's try this.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.180]   One, two, three.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.180]   I can't see anything.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.180]   You know what it's not?
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.180]   Oh, it's not allowing it.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.180]   That's why.
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.180]   All right, we're going to start over.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.180]   It's getting blackness.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.180]   OK.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:46.180]   Yeah, stop it.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.180]   No, no, start over.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.180]   OK.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.980]   All right, ready for my close-up?
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.180]   I knew you would like this.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:23:00.980]   No, that's not what I wanted.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.980]   There's no action.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.980]   What's the tell me?
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:03.980]   We did it too fast.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:04.980]   We did it too fast.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.980]   It counts down.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.980]   So wait.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.980]   Three, two, one.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:08.980]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.980]   We keep waiting and go.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:11.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.980]   It's terrible.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.980]   It's great.
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:14.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.980]   It looks like a fish.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   All right, we've spent way too much time on that.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.980]   Let's make a whole show of that.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.980]   Oh, my God.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   I can do better.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.980]   I can't.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.980]   I'll do it later, though.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:23.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.980]   And then does this automatically post it somewhere?
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   It just gives you a URL and you can share it where you want.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.980]   I don't believe it's public by default, though.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.980]   OK.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.980]   We're three seconds of video with your webcam.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   Edit the video.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.980]   Oh, you can edit it.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   And then save it.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:39.980]   So this is pretty sophisticated.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   Adam, nice job.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.980]   And he worked with Ellen Flaherty, who's a designer.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.980]   See, everybody who's designed.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.980]   It's all about design.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.980]   Look at these icons.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   He's like, I have to school and got into webcam.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:56.980]   So he went to hacker school?
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980]   He did, yeah.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   What's hacker school?
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:23:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.980]   Hacker school is that it's that program.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:02.980]   It's here in New York.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:03.980]   It's for a--
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:04.980]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.980]   It's like a summer-long program for people inspiring coders.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.980]   So he wasn't a coder before?
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   He dabbled quite a bit when we were at Life Hacker on side projects
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.980]   and things, but he felt like he just wanted to get better at it
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.980]   and be more competent.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.980]   So he did hacker school for a few months.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.980]   And then I was like, is one of the things that came out of it.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.980]   He's working on a couple of other projects too now.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:24.980]   I want to go to hacker school.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.980]   Tell me about it.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:30.980]   Google is testing a new service for the Chrome browser called
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:34.980]   Google Stars that will let you star items on the web as well as
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.980]   Adam to folders.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   Once saved, these items are called stars and they can be
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.980]   searched for as well as shared with others.
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:41.980]   So it's kind of--
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980]   I don't know.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   Google's stumble upon.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.980]   Now they--
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.980]   It's kind of--
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.980]   It's kind of like Twitter stars, but favorites, but now you can do
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.980]   it to the whole web.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.980]   The star of the web.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:52.980]   You do with it.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:53.980]   Wow.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.980]   Um...
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   You know what we haven't done, Leo?
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.980]   The changelog.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.980]   I just realized that.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   Holy moly.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:07.980]   Ladies and gentlemen, my God, what have we been thinking?
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:12.980]   It's time for the Google changelog.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.980]   And now he is Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.980]   Time lapse.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   Google Street View is rolling out time lapse photos to its
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:27.980]   a preview feature which lets you go back in time and see previous
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   photos the Google Street Maps car took up the same place.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.980]   That's neat.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   So once you have the feature enabled, and I'm not seeing it here
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   on my maps, I don't know if you--
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   I was looking for it just earlier.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980]   You'll get an hourglass, right?
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:43.980]   You'll get an hourglass.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.980]   I'm not quite seeing that yet.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.980]   You'll get a little time icon and a slider control that lets you
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.980]   slide back.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.980]   So you'll see Chads got the video up there.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.980]   You can see if you go to say one world trade center or the
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   Freedom Tower, you can go back and see the construction.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.980]   You can see buildings kind of get pop up out of the ground,
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.980]   which is really cool.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.980]   Google says the new feature lets you see Landmark's growth,
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   or you can see things like Reconstruction after 2011
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:08.980]   earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   And you can even experience different seasons.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   You can see what you like to cruise roadways in both summer
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:13.980]   and winter.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:14.980]   So yeah, really neat.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:15.980]   Time lapse.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.980]   When I first saw this, I thought, oh cool, I could go back to
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:20.980]   1856 or something, but the street view wasn't around back then.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:22.980]   No, no, the street view was only around about seven years,
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.980]   and the photos are about one to two years old.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.980]   So you can really kind of see there's big differences between
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.980]   them, especially in construction sites like down a world trade
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.980]   center.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.980]   What else do we have?
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.980]   Oh, it updates to the Hangouts app for Android that will be
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   released later this week, merges SMS and Hangout conversations,
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   and the same with the same user in a single log.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.980]   So if you start a conversation with someone over at SMS and later
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:49.980]   you chat with them via regular Hangouts, you see all those
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:51.980]   messages kind of in the same view.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.980]   If you don't like this change, no big deal.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   You can disable it on the fly and you can switch between SMS or
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.980]   Hangouts while you're chatting with someone to get the choice,
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:01.980]   the text that person or just regular Hangout them.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   And you can see in that screenshot, I think the Hangout
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   messages and the SMS messages are shown differently.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.980]   I think one's white and one's green.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.980]   So you can kind of tell which way it was sent.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.980]   Right.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:14.980]   And there's a little yes and yes below each message.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:20.980]   I still don't use Hangouts for SMS is too heavy weight.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.980]   Unified messaging happening.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.980]   So what do you do?
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.980]   Did you download a separate texting app like texture or something?
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.980]   I've tried a bunch of them.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.980]   I just use the HTC app.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:29.980]   You just use the HTC app.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.980]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:34.980]   Yeah, I don't mind using Hangouts, but I've had a lot of people
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.980]   say that they don't want their SMS and Hangouts and they just
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:39.980]   text for your text messaging.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:40.980]   You use Hangouts for your text messaging.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.980]   You know, I use Google Voice, so I don't actually even use the
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.980]   Native Texting app.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.980]   I just use Voice for everything.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:46.980]   Which is really clunky.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:52.980]   Voice kind of, I don't know how, but Voice ties in with the text
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.980]   messaging app, the Native text messaging app on your phone.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   So I'll get Google Voice text in my SMS.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.980]   And then if I respond to that, then it stays within Voice.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   Yes.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   If I initiate, I have to initiate in Voice if I want it to be from
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]   my Voice number.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:08.980]   Yes.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.980]   It's a little weird.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:10.980]   It's all very weird.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.980]   We need a unified system that would also allow third parties,
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.980]   like Facebook Messenger, to become part of it.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   Agreed.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.980]   Absolutely.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:21.980]   I look forward to Google Voice being part of Hangouts because
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.980]   it's clearly been a neglected Android app and that's clearly the
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.980]   road they're going down.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:26.980]   Yep.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:28.980]   But as do we have, oh, Google Trends.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.980]   So this is the tool that shows you what users are searching for on
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.980]   Google now offers email subscriptions.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:37.980]   So if you want to keep on top of a sports team, a celebrity or a
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.980]   brand, you can subscribe to get email notifications if searches for
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.980]   those topics spike and you get those email notifications once a week
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:45.980]   or once a month.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:50.980]   You can also subscribe to Hot searches for any country or any US
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:54.980]   monthly top chart, entertainment, news, et cetera.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   So you can kind of keep on top of what's popular amongst web
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:58.980]   searchers.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:03.980]   And finally, Google Analytics, making life easier for app
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:05.980]   developers and content providers.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.980]   And a new update that's rolling out in the next few weeks, the
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.980]   Analytics app will merge web and app data into a single report.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.980]   So if you've got content on the web and you've got content inside
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.980]   of an app, Google Analytics will show those all in one space.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:21.980]   So instead of talking about visits, which only makes sense on the
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   web, Analytics now refers to sessions.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   So it's users in both your app and on the web.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:31.980]   And instead of calling people visitors, like it was what kind of
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.980]   traditional conventional web terms, they're just called users now.
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.980]   So merging app and web, it's kind of interesting.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.980]   So you can get better reporting and better insights about how your
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.980]   users are interacting with your stuff across different touch points.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   That's it.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:46.980]   That's all I got.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:47.980]   Play the drums slowly.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   That the good change, you're all good.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.980]   Now I want to put the soundtrack behind your wangy, wangy, wangy
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.980]   and figure things.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   I want to use that music behind that in time.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   That was a good one.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   I will share that to Google+, and you guys can do whatever you
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   wish with it.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.980]   Before we wrap up, a couple of quick stories.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.980]   I know this was a big one for you, Jeff, so I don't want to let it
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   go.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.980]   FCC proposal that would destroy net neutrality according to the
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   Verge.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   According to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.980]   And the journal, okay, let's, let's, the Verge is quoting the
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:21.980]   Journal.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:22.980]   So let's go to the original.
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   The FCC plans to propose a new open internet rule on Thursday
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   that would allow content companies to pay internet service
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.980]   providers for special access to consumers.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   So let's be very clear here, folks.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.980]   That's not net neutrality.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   That's not, and it'll be opposite.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.980]   That is killing net neutrality.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   So, so apparently they think they're going to.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.980]   That's the case we need.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:49.980]   I want that anime, I guess.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.980]   Apparently they think they're going to fool regular people by
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   saying the rules are prevent the service providers from blocking
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   or discriminating against specific websites.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:00.980]   Like that's the problem.
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   But would allow broadband providers to give some traffic
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:07.980]   preferential treatment so long as such arrangements are available
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.980]   on commercially reasonable terms.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.980]   So, yeah, so what else we're going to charge you for decent
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.980]   carriage of your content?
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.980]   Everything else is going to be delivered like molasses.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   Unbelievable.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:17.980]   That is unbelievable.
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:18.980]   It is terrible.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:19.980]   It is wrong.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   Wrong.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   Wrong.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   It kills the internet.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:26.980]   FCC, guess what the F stands for?
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.980]   This is really disappointing.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:31.980]   Now, the chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, former cable company
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   lobbyist, has absolutely got to take the flack for this.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.980]   He absolutely does.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:43.980]   The revolving door went around and slapped his butt as he's going
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.980]   in to the FCC.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.980]   It's just awful, just terrible.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   He says he's following the roadmap that the court prescribed
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:59.980]   prescribed to give the FCC jurisdiction here.
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:06.980]   But to say, oh, yeah, you can't block a website which was
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:07.980]   never at issue.
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:11.980]   But you can charge for access to consumers, which is exactly
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   the issue, is not, this is not an open internet rule.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:16.980]   This is a closed--
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.980]   Probably this is the exact opposite.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   This is a kill the internet rule.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:22.980]   F-U-F-C-C.
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.980]   Funnel cake?
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.980]   Fandango?
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.980]   Frilly?
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.980]   Whether the terms are commercially reasonable would be
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.980]   decided by the FCC on a case-by-case basis.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:37.980]   Oh, yeah, that's going to work well.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:41.980]   Yeah, if Comcast wants to squeeze, tweet, and say, hey, if you
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.980]   would desire to reach our customers with your programming,
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:48.980]   we'd like to charge you $1 million, then I would have to go to
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   the FCC and say, wait a minute, that's not commercially
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:53.980]   reasonable.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.980]   And Comcast has 87,000 lawyers, and you have none.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.980]   And then five years later--
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:32:59.980]   You can realize the number of times you have a advertiser that
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.980]   gives you forms you can fill out, but you don't have lobbyists.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:10.980]   The companies would be paying for preferential treatment on the
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.980]   last mile of broadband networks, connects directly to consumers.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.980]   The words preferential treatment.
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.980]   Right there.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.980]   That should tell you something.
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:22.980]   Listen, tech bill out there.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.980]   You fought soap of people?
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.980]   What was that?
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:25.980]   Gee, I want to be able to watch a movie.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.980]   That was nothing.
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:27.980]   That was unimportant.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.980]   This is the very heart, soul, and essence of the internet.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:31.980]   Fight people.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   Fight.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   This has nothing to do with--
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   That's signal time.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.980]   This has nothing to do with what Netflix already paid Comcast
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:38.980]   for, the peering.
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:39.980]   This isn't about peering.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.980]   This isn't about back-end and ear connection.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:46.980]   This is saying if you would like to get to the house,
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.980]   what are you going to give us?
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.980]   I just don't get this.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   What is the point of this?
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:54.980]   Why?
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:56.980]   Because the Wall Street Journal was wrong.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.980]   Unless the Wall Street Journal got it wrong.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:33:59.980]   And it's a trial balloon.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:00.980]   We don't know.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:01.980]   We'll find out on Thursday.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.980]   If true, it is utterly, completely, absolutely disgusting.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:07.980]   And I'm telling you people to the barricades.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:10.980]   Don't-- Gee and I have this conversation with the show very
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:11.980]   often.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.980]   All you geeks think you can hack around something.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.980]   You can't hack around this.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   This ruins the internet.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.980]   This ruins the internet.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:21.980]   Well, it does open an opportunity for an internet service
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   provider that chooses not to do this.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   The problem is the same FCC gave us--
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:31.980]   these duopoly rules, which means we don't have, in most cases,
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.980]   a choice between more than one or two internet service providers.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.980]   Even if you do, who is it?
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.980]   In my case, it's cable vision and Verizon.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.980]   Well, I can give you an example.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:44.980]   SonicNet, which is a great independent internet service
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.980]   provider, is here up.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.980]   They would, of course, never do this.
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:50.980]   But the problem is they come in over copper.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:51.980]   They're a DSL provider.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:52.980]   There is no way to do it over cable.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:53.980]   That's not allowed.
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   So they come in over copper.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:59.980]   So they're kind of at the-- I think at the mercy of the phone
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:00.980]   companies.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.980]   And I'm sure the phone companies will find ways to screw these
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.980]   guys.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.980]   Oh, this is really bad news.
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.980]   I'm glad we ended the show with this.
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:08.980]   And I didn't begin it.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:09.980]   I wouldn't have been happy.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:10.980]   This is terrible.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:14.980]   Let's watch with interest tomorrow.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.980]   They have not been released.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   But this is a huge departure from previous Open Internet rules.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:24.980]   This is Tom Wheeler, cashing the check from the cable companies.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:25.980]   Yep.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:26.980]   Yep.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.980]   Mr. Wheeler, we know what's in your wallet.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.980]   All right, last week when I brought the showdown, I tried to get
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.980]   a little amusement back into it then.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.980]   So I'll try that again this week.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:36.980]   Mameusas.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   At the Google Glass, there is a funny bank ad Mox Glass.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.980]   No, boy.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.980]   OK.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:47.980]   So I'm going to play that for you now here.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.980]   I think I might have seen this, actually.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.980]   Well, maybe it's old.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   I don't know.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:52.980]   No, no.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:53.980]   I think I saw this on time because--
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:54.980]   It's fine.
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:57.980]   First bank.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.980]   Who wants more peace?
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.980]   I'm trying to laugh.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.980]   She's watching TV.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.980]   Go away.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:04.980]   Oh, and Daddy hates pop-up ads.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:05.980]   Go away.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   Hashtag dinner time.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:08.980]   Go forward.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:09.980]   No.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:10.980]   Sell me.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:11.980]   Go forward.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.980]   Delete, sell me.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.980]   Go away.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:14.980]   Bookmark.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:15.980]   Go away.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.980]   No, post photo.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.980]   Go up.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:18.980]   Go forward.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.980]   Hashtag crazy.
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:21.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:23.980]   So, mom is serving dinner.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:26.980]   This has nothing to do with a bank, by the way.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:31.980]   Obviously, they just felt like we got a really skewer glass here.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.980]   Go away.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:33.980]   I think this is kind of true.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   Go away.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.980]   Go away.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.980]   Dad's pushing away pop-ups.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.980]   Mom's putting the P's on the table because she's watching TV while she's serving.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.980]   The little-- the boy, the son is playing video games.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.980]   The daughter's trying to, you know, food spot.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.980]   This isn't so far from reality.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:49.980]   It isn't.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.980]   Oh, it isn't, actually.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:51.980]   Frankly.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:52.980]   What happened?
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:54.980]   Scoble did a 180 on glass.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:55.980]   Oh, wow.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   Well, that was the--
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:57.980]   Gee, you couldn't see that coming.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:58.980]   Good.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.980]   What does he-- he doesn't like it now?
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.980]   Apparently.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.980]   Last night before Skrillex at Coachella came on, two guys were talking next to me, says
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:07.980]   Robert Scoble.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.980]   One said, "I want to get away from the Google Glass guys.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.980]   I turn around and there are two guys wearing glass.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.980]   Google has a problem here.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.980]   I haven't worn mine all weekend."
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.980]   Oh, Robert goes to Coachella.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:22.980]   He did.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.980]   He took a lot of pictures at Coachella.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:26.980]   Not from glass.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.980]   With his camera, not with his glasses.
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.980]   He has a very big camera.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.980]   So--
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:32.980]   I have been saying this all along, by the way.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:33.980]   I just want to point out.
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:38.980]   Here's something random, say, "I want to get away from those guys with glass."
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.980]   And--
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.980]   Okay.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.980]   Okay.
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:42.980]   Google says--
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:43.980]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:48.980]   --this is because we didn't have enough people wearing glass.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.980]   It was too small a roll out.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.980]   Marketing guy--
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:01.980]   The spawning effect to this backlash, marketing guy Ed Sanders, says the backlash is a result
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:04.980]   of the way Google decided to roll out glass.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:07.980]   But it was a deliberate decision to do it that way with the limited public beta surrounded
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.980]   by a nimbus of hype and curiosity.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.980]   It was an unusual step of doing it so exposed and risks come with that.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.980]   Actually, some of this is a quote, some of this is not.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.980]   This is Forbes writer Jeff Berkovichi.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:25.900]   But the quote is, "We knew there would be downsides, but we also knew and know there would be a
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.900]   tremendous upside."
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:29.900]   So I guess this makes sense.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.900]   In fact, any publicity is good publicity.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:35.900]   Having Robert Scobel bitch about glass on Facebook is good for them.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.900]   As somebody said--
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.900]   Exactly, somebody said on Twitter, "Your glass going to take off.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.900]   My glass futures."
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.900]   I don't think so.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:44.900]   Scobel gives them up.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.900]   No one's Scobel gives up.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:46.900]   I know.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:47.900]   But I frankly don't think--
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:48.900]   No.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.900]   This is a fascinating experiment.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.900]   But interesting that the $1,500 price point was chosen to only get people who are--
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.900]   I'm not interested in not based on the hardware.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.900]   I've got to tell you, I didn't love that.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.900]   It makes me feel like a shimok.
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.900]   Well, it doesn't choose for people who are really interested.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.900]   It chooses for people who are really rich.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.900]   Which is where home $1,500 is not a challenge.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.900]   And there are other ways to limit access.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.900]   I'm sure there are plenty of explorers.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.900]   And I know that there are plenty of explorers who got chosen but couldn't afford it.
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.900]   We saw lots of indiegogo campaigns and people trying to get--
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:18.900]   Yup.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.900]   --trying to pay for glass in different ways.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.900]   So I didn't love that so much.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.900]   I was like, "Oh."
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.900]   If you want all your beta testers to be rich, then that's what you do.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.900]   But I don't think that was the point.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.900]   Sanders, who is in charge of marketing for glass, says, "Nothing great has been achieved
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.900]   where it's incremental.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:39.900]   You have to go all in."
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:44.900]   But it is a little-- the high price point, another quote, "Isn't about the cost of the device.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:47.900]   We want people who are going to be passionate about it."
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:51.900]   Does that really mean that it didn't cost them that much?
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.900]   I mean, that sounds like the implication, right?
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.900]   I mean, maybe they wanted people who were so passionate they were willing to, you know,
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.900]   raise money for it.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:01.900]   Well.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.900]   Hmm.
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:05.900]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:09.900]   When we come back, tool tip number, we'll wrap this puppy up.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.900]   Our show today brought to you by Snacks.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.900]   Here comes my nature box.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.900]   Bring me my nature box.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.900]   I feel like Old King Cole.
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:25.900]   You know about this, this is Snacks delivered to your door every month.
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:28.900]   There are three different size boxes.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:34.900]   You can go to naturebox.com/twit, put together your first box, and get 50% off it.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:39.900]   Now, what makes nature box unique is that these are not only great tasting, delicious
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.900]   snacks, but they're healthy too.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.900]   No trans fats, no zero high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial, no artificial
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.900]   sweeteners, flavors or colors.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.900]   This is good stuff.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:55.900]   You can select by your dietary needs, of course, vegan, soy, free gluten conscious,
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.900]   lactose, free nut, free non GMO, also by taste, savory, sweet or spicy.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.900]   But my suggestion is on that first box, just get an assortment because there's
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:04.900]   so many great things.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:05.900]   What am I opening here?
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:07.900]   Oh, peppery pistachios.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:14.900]   So this is a good example of just a delicious healthy snack so much better than going to
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:19.900]   the machine and getting a new apple pie cluster.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:20.900]   Oh, those are good.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.900]   Oh, those are good.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:24.900]   I got to get the fruit juice.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.900]   All right, you know what?
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:27.900]   You would really like this, then.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.900]   I can see you're going with the fruit.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:33.900]   Blueberry almond bites, crispy almond and rice squares and blueberries.
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.900]   Now, all these bags are resealable.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.900]   They have their, you know, that zip lock thing.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:40.900]   So, oh, look at this.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:41.900]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:42.900]   Okay, I'm going to.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:44.900]   Citrus chipotle chickpea.
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:45.900]   Mmm.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.900]   That sounds amazing.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.900]   This is chipotle chickpea.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:50.900]   It sounds good.
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.900]   How about seaweed rice pops?
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:53.900]   Not so much.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.900]   Well, but that's the thing.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.900]   You can pick your shoes.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:57.900]   Go ahead.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.900]   I'll not pick the seaweed rice pops.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.900]   Free shipping anywhere in the US.
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:02.900]   Delicious.
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:04.900]   Three, six or twelve months subscriptions.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.900]   We'll just get that first box and try it today.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.900]   Naturebox.com/twits.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:09.900]   My favorite part of the show.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.900]   Praline pumpkin seeds.
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:13.900]   That's good.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.900]   I've had those.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.900]   Whole wheat apple pie figgy bars.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.900]   I just like saying.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.900]   They do a number of different figgy bars that are fabulous.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.900]   Don't go to the evil vending machine, my friends.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.900]   Go to naturebox.com/twit.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.900]   Mmm.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.900]   This is really good.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.900]   It's like healthy rice crispy treats kind of.
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:34.900]   Mmm.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:38.900]   Would I rather have regular shipments of razor blades or...
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:39.900]   Get both.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.900]   Tree box.
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:41.900]   Yeah, I want to blow it.
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:42.900]   Did we ever get...
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:43.900]   Did we send you...
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.900]   Was it you that I sent the Harry's box to?
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.900]   I can't remember.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:47.900]   No, I already have Harry's.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:48.900]   I already have Harry's.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.900]   Don't tell us about the shaving thing.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:51.900]   Is this for charity?
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.900]   No, no, I was for you.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.900]   You want me to shave?
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.900]   No, there were two shaving sponsors who were fighting.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:00.900]   And I said you could have my face.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:01.900]   Oh, I get it.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.900]   So whoever wins gets to shave you.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:05.900]   If it's enough.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:06.900]   If it's enough.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   And if it's on Twig.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.900]   I just went.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.900]   Oh, you got to buy Twig.
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.900]   Oh.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.900]   Harry's listen up.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:14.900]   It's beyond Twig.
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.900]   Listen up Harry's.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.900]   He's already a Harry's customer.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:22.900]   Martin in Europe says the nature box ads are torture.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:28.900]   [laughter]
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:29.900]   For us too.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.900]   [laughter]
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:33.900]   But Harry's not in the studio.
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.900]   Time for Gina's tip of the week.
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.900]   Well, I got to tell you, I was having a hard time finding a tip this week.
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.900]   And then I was like.co.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.900]   You should definitely check out.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:46.900]   And I can remember if we covered it on this show.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:48.900]   I know we talked about definitely an all about Android.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.900]   But did you cover the last past update where now it does auto-fill on Android?
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.900]   Then we talked about this.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.900]   It feels like we did.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:56.900]   You know, I love it.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:58.900]   I apologize if we've come to the authority.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:00.900]   And I think, now see if this ends for me here.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.900]   Because I found a bug in it that caused the HTC One M8 camera to crash.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:05.900]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:06.900]   The camera.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:11.900]   Yeah, because the camera didn't expect one past, or some of your last past to pop up,
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.900]   if some of your last past wanted to pop up.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   Oh, weird.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900]   So it puzzled me.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.900]   Now this pop-up is great.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.900]   It's inconsistent, unfortunately.
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:25.900]   And something, I don't know, for some reason I'm able to find a lot of sites that won't let me paste.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:28.900]   So when it works right, it works wonderfully.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:31.900]   So you're on a site like path, for instance.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.900]   And you want to log into path.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:34.900]   It was like a native path.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:35.900]   Not just a site that did that.
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:36.900]   Not just a site that did that.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.900]   Did I say site?
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:38.900]   I meant app, exactly.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.900]   In fact, let me log out of path so I can show you what this looks like.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:43.900]   Because it's really awesome.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.900]   So I'm going to log out of path.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.900]   And then I will log back in.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.900]   So you launch path, you say log in.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:54.900]   And if you have last pass on your Android device and you start typing the password,
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:58.900]   it's not going to do it, is it?
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:44:59.900]   There it is.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:00.900]   There it is.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.900]   Now, now don't look because I have a pin.
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.900]   And by the way, I would recommend that you do that.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.900]   Require at least a pin, if not a full login.
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.900]   But once I gave the pin, which I did, it says, "Oh, you're on path.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.900]   Should I fill it in?"
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.900]   I tap it, it fills it in.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.900]   And I'm done.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.900]   And I'm going to log in.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.900]   So that is a really nice feature.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.900]   Now, there's a couple of weirdnesses.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.900]   Sometimes it doesn't pop up.
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:29.900]   Sometimes it does pop up and it says copy and paste, copy and paste.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.900]   It can't auto fill.
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:35.900]   And then sometimes on sites, I don't know about you, but I found sites where I can't paste.
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.900]   Not sites, but apps.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.900]   Oh, weird.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.900]   I haven't heard that.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.900]   It works for me more often than not.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:42.900]   It works enough.
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:43.900]   And it makes me, yeah.
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:48.900]   It makes me so happy because it used to be copy ads to the notifications and flip, but
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:49.900]   copy and paste.
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.900]   It was such a rigmarole.
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.900]   But it's so much better now.
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.900]   So, yeah, it's got a little weirdness here and there.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.900]   But better than nothing.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.700]   Everybody knows because we've told them, because of the heart bleed bug that you should be
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.740]   using a password vault.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.740]   We love LastPass.
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.460]   I do want to point out one other way that you could do this before.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.620]   New feature is really nice.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:15.260]   But you also get a LastPass keyboard and you can.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:17.300]   And it's a crappy keyboard.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.740]   But I do make it my default keyboard when I'm first setting up a new phone because then
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.740]   it's kind of the same thing.
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.900]   When the keyboard comes up, you could say, hey, just fill it in.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.620]   So that was the previous way of doing it.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.540]   And it's still around.
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.140]   LastPass is a must-have on Android, iOS, on Mac, on Windows.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.340]   It's just, I love it.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:40.380]   Yeah, I feel like I've cheerleader for LastPass a few times, but that particular feature has
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.860]   still delights me every time it works.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.380]   I'm like, oh, because I set up my new M8.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.020]   And it was so much easier.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:46.020]   Right.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:48.020]   Right.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:53.980]   So one other issue, as I mentioned, at least on the HTC version of the M8, the camera
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.540]   app was crashing, crashing, crashing.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.780]   And I did a lot of searching and I finally found it.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.380]   I think LastPass has fixed it within an update.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.740]   But when I was launching the camera app, for some reason it was launching, LastPass was
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:07.900]   trying to launch its pop-up and it would crash the camera app.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:12.900]   All I had to do was go into the LastPass settings and say, because you can control which apps
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.900]   launch.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:14.900]   Again, I'm not showing you this.
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:15.900]   Right.
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:16.900]   And say don't launch.
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:17.900]   Right.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:18.900]   Don't launch for this app.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.900]   Yep.
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:20.900]   Yeah, that wasn't happening with the Google Play Edition.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.780]   And it's not happening with the regular Google camera from the Play Store, which is what I'm
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:24.780]   using now.
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:31.020]   The Google Play Edition of the M8 come with the Google camera or an actual HTC camera.
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:33.900]   It comes with the Google camera.
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.660]   But it's a special version.
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:40.940]   Like they fork the Google camera to include the focus shifting and the 3D.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.580]   So it has a few HTC features.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:45.420]   I think it's actually a special build.
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.420]   Got it.
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.420]   So here's where you change it.
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.740]   This is in the LastPass preferences.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.780]   First of all, you have to enable fill-in to apps.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.380]   That's not on by default.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:59.860]   So you want to go into LastPass preferences, scroll down, and enable fill-in to apps.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:01.220]   That's what Gina's talking about.
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.220]   And then the app associations are a list.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:08.380]   And that's where you can say, "Hey, when the camera launches, please don't try to do
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.820]   a password login."
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:11.900]   That's the first one I found.
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.900]   There may be others.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.780]   And of course, LastPass probably fixes it as time goes by.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.220]   But just a little tip if you do have a problem with a crashing app all of a sudden.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.620]   The only one who was, it was a confluence of a new phone that--
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.620]   Yes.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.620]   --and then an update to LastPass.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.300]   And neither could test because both were brand new.
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:30.300]   Right.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.260]   Not unusual.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:33.860]   Jeff, I highly recommend it.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.340]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.340]   All right.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.340]   I'm a little confused about this number.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.140]   Maybe you can explain it to me, Lucy.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:44.220]   So as you remember, Google did a stock split.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:47.620]   And it came out with a class C shares--
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:48.620]   Nonvoting.
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:49.620]   Nonvoting.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.620]   Class A shares are voting.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.620]   Right.
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.860]   And a price differential has developed.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:56.860]   There wasn't supposed to be.
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860]   $11.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:58.860]   Okay.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:07.260]   $11 on average according to the story that I have in the-- or today, the class Google
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:15.060]   shares, which are class C, is $527.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:20.380]   Google, G-O-G-L shares, which are class A, is $537.
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.820]   So you're talking about $11 between.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:28.820]   So the nonvoting shares are worth more than the voting shares.
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:29.820]   What?
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820]   What?
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.820]   What?
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.460]   That doesn't make sense to me.
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.100]   Did I get the story wrong?
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:39.900]   You would think that the voting shares would be worth more than the nonvoting share.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.900]   Well, right?
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.540]   The story got reversed.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.660]   I don't know.
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:47.660]   I don't know.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.660]   It's a mystery to me.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.660]   Weird.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.420]   Everything that happens on the stock market is a mystery to me.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:52.420]   Yes, it is.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.420]   Me too, unfortunately.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.420]   No, no, no.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.420]   I'm okay.
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.420]   Yeah, Leo, go short one of them, but I don't know which one.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.420]   I'm going to short something.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.420]   I'm going to short something.
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:02.180]   How do you do that again?
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:06.060]   The number is 11, but I don't know what it means.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.940]   $11 this year.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:13.180]   I was going to actually do that Google Maps time machine thing as a--
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.380]   Oh, whoops, I'm sorry.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.140]   No, I don't care because you got it in.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:19.740]   That's a better place for it, really.
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:26.620]   I guess this isn't a tool, but I do want a warning if you haven't upgraded a KitKat
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.020]   yet and you use an SD card.
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:31.900]   And I actually wanted to ask you about this, Gina, because you're the developer here.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:37.260]   Did you have you talked about this on all about Android, but in KitKat and 4.4, Google
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:42.460]   really changes how SD cards are handled with file permissions.
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.180]   And I think they--
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:48.860]   This is a long Google group posting which includes a response from Jeff Sharkey who's
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.620]   on the team, on the Android team.
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:51:02.220]   Before KitKat, public APIs only supported a single primary external storage device.
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:08.060]   And most of the time that was emulated, it was the internal storage, not the SD card.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:15.700]   Primary external storage devices, that is SD0 on most Android devices, have not--
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:18.860]   They continue to work the way they always have.
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:26.620]   However, the SD card, secondary external storage devices, they have limited right access to
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:28.620]   directories belonging to the app.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.820]   Now, this makes sense.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.020]   An app shouldn't be able to write anywhere it wants on the SD card.
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.780]   At least it seems to make sense initially.
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:41.580]   But it breaks a ton of apps and developers are really pissed off.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.940]   And there are a lot of use cases where it makes sense, especially camera apps, things
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.940]   like that where an app might want to be able to write--
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.340]   Let's say you take a picture with an app.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:55.980]   The app has its own storage in the SD card, but it would like to save the picture to the
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:56.980]   camera's store.
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:59.500]   It can't.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.500]   Because it doesn't have access.
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.820]   Now, that's a security thing, I think.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:08.220]   Yeah, they do-- Android does handbox app permissions to particular folders, which really is good
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:09.220]   practice.
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:14.780]   But a warning, because this is new to KitKat.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:18.780]   Before KitKat, some OEMs chose to leave external storage devices unprotected.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:25.300]   In other words, apps could write wherever they want if they could understand the path.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:29.500]   But he says these were never part of any public platform API.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:32.060]   They were internal implementation detail.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:33.940]   We warned you again and again.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.940]   You shouldn't depend on these hidden behaviors.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:38.060]   Well, now you're screwed.
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:44.020]   But as an end user, you might want to be aware of this and you might check your app before
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.060]   you upgrade to KitKat if you haven't done so already.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:47.980]   I haven't had any problems yet.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:50.420]   Yeah, I haven't seen any problems with this.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.660]   I wonder how this manifests.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.820]   I guess this is a crash or it's not a honey.
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:54.820]   Sometimes it'll crash.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:58.980]   If the app is well written, it'll just say I can't write to that directory.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.980]   Some apps crash.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.980]   It's the longest time to do text wrote to assume do had an SD card.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:07.620]   This is early in our development, but it assumed you had an SD card.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.460]   So if you didn't, it would just crash.
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:11.460]   It would just crash.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.460]   It was terrible.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:13.460]   It was terrible.
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:20.020]   So if you have ES file manager, which is a very popular file manager, I think it can
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:23.060]   delete files from other directories, but it can't.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:26.340]   So it says I deleted the file and then you see it's still there.
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:29.540]   Because it obviously, so there's no way to request that permission.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:30.540]   Wow.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.300]   Well, I think I kind of understand it.
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:36.260]   I mean, it is more secure, but it does make SD cards a lot less useful.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:37.780]   Yeah, it does.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:39.780]   It does.
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:42.180]   And it seems like that should be a permission that the user could grant.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.380]   I mean, a file manager, you want to give access to all your files that it can manage
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.380]   them.
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.380]   Yes.
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:48.380]   Right?
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.300]   I mean, the way that like, for instance, Dropbox implements that this in their API is that by
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:56.420]   default apps get a certain folder, but you can ask for full permission to your entire
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.980]   Dropbox, but the user has to grant that.
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:01.420]   So yeah, this is interesting.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.780]   You can see the security argument, right?
[01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:05.500]   But it does render certain things like a file manager.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:10.460]   You'll also see then fewer apps using SD cards are working with SD cards because they can't
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.460]   or they won't.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:12.460]   Because they can't.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.300]   So that makes an SD card somewhat less usable and going forward in Android devices.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.300]   Just thought I'd mention that.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.300]   It's not a tool.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.260]   It's kind of a tip.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.260]   Hey, thank you.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:29.260]   Good luck getting into Google I owe you to my hands of it.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:32.780]   We prostrate prostate ourselves anymore or prostate ourselves.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:34.420]   You could prostate yourself.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.420]   You can prostate.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.420]   Speak for yourself, Jarvis.
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.460]   I can't anymore.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:42.060]   The prostate free Jeff Jarvis will now prostrate himself.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.780]   Are you a benefit?
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:45.100]   I'm also prostate free.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.660]   So hey, there you go.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.500]   Women don't have prostates.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.500]   No one.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.780]   No one are the prated prostate cancer and women is so dramatically though.
[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:54.340]   Two sphincters.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.500]   Women have one.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.860]   We won't go into that today.
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:54:59.860]   I lost one of them.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.060]   I've been a man my whole life.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.940]   And this is the first time I'm fighting out about this.
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:05.940]   I'm devastated.
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:08.500]   That's why I need a user manual.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.500]   That's why we drip.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:15.500]   I don't leave it at that.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:26.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for being here.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:29.780]   Jeff Jarvis, the City University of New York journalism professor there.
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:33.500]   He's also the author of Public Parts, blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:34.500]   Must read.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.500]   Must read.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.580]   Gina is at ThinkUp.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.580]   She's a CTO there.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.500]   ThinkUp.com if you haven't subscribed yet.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.500]   Do.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:42.500]   It's great.
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.500]   We love it.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.500]   I love the insights.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.100]   There's so much better for me.
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.660]   Hey, so come to hear that.
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.660]   Thank you.
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:49.660]   I really love it.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.220]   It's fun.
[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:53.140]   So go there and sign up.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:55.340]   Thank you, sir.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:59.220]   I'm just looking right now at my insights.
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:02.500]   Here's the deal with Leo LaPort's tweets.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.140]   Oh, Vincent.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.500]   Oh, Vincent really got him going.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.060]   That was a big one.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.980]   There were 23 likes.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.620]   Anyway, this is all ThinkUp stuff.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.860]   Really recommend it.
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:19.300]   We do this show this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:23.500]   Time 2000 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:24.500]   Please join us live.
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.700]   If you can, you can even come to the studio if you email tickets@twit.tv.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.780]   We'll be glad to welcome you and put a chair out for you.
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:38.300]   But also, you can get on-demand audio and video of each and every show merely by visiting
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:43.580]   twit.tv/twig or by, um,
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:44.580]   subscribing.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:48.740]   I think that's the best thing to do in dogcatcher or Instacast or whatever it is.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:54.820]   You like to use iTunes to keep track of your Google reader, to keep track of your podcasts.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.540]   Hey, thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time on twig.
