[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   It's time for Twig this week at Google, Gina and Jeff.
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.800]   What is the best Android phone?
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.400]   Is it the Moto X, the HTC One, the Galaxy S4,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100]   maybe that new LG G2.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100]   It's all coming up as we talk about Android, Google,
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.400]   and the cloud.

[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.900]   the world around us, and anything Jeff Jarvis and Gina
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.700]   Trippani Damwell want to talk about.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.200]   Let me introduce our host, Gina Trippani of smarterware.org,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   founder, founder, founder, founder of Life Hacker,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.500]   and creator of Tootoo Text and ThinkUpApp,
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.600]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.700]   of New York, and author of Public Parts,
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.800]   available bookstores everywhere.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.700]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700]   Hello, kids.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.200]   Hey.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.700]   Hey.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   So a little bit of stuff happened since we were here last.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700]   You have a new toy on your desk.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700]   I got a new phone.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.400]   So do you.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   I see your HTC One.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.900]   Oh, I like new.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.400]   Like them.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.700]   HTC One just got Android 4.3, so soon.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700]   It was soon.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.200]   Hey.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   Impressed and pressed.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   Happy with it.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.700]   Happy with it.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.200]   I'm trying to remember what I should be looking for
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.000]   in 1.4.3.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Some camera changes.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.700]   There's profiles, which is a big thing.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   Oh, those right profiles?
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   What else?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Some of the camera settings were a little different.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   I'm poking around.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   I'm very happy.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   You're very happy that that update came down because I didn't want to have to wait very
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   long.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   You know, it prompted me because the HTC Sense is still at 4.2.2, and will be probably
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   for a while.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   It takes a while to update that stuff.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.700]   The Google Experience phone, which is what you have got updated.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.200]   So I put the Google Experience ROM on my stock HTC One.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   Nice.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   I wanted 4.3.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   Yes, you're turning.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   You're coming back to the kind of pure experience.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Yeah, when we're talking about your experience.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.640]   Before the show, I was arguing against Google Experience HTC One because of the Zowys and
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.880]   the highlights and some sense-specific stuff.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   But I'm kind of getting--after using the Moto X for a little while, I'm getting burned.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200]   I don't--like, I gave up on the Galaxy S4 because it's so jumped up.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   I didn't work with a friend's phone, and it drove me--in 10 minutes it drove me not a
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   few.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   And then I did the same thing to the--this is normally an AT&T HTC One, but I put--you
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   know, you can get the Google Experience ROM on it.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.920]   And so I put--and then you can get 4.3, Google Experience ROM.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   The ROM guys are fast.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.880]   They waste no time.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   And it's--you know what?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   I like it.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   I like it.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.560]   But it all started with the Moto X.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.160]   I finally got one--of course, the big announcement was the review was on Wednesday, and I got
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.680]   mine on Friday, but playing with it.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.480]   And you know, I have--it's not perfect.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.920]   I told Gina, cryptically, that she should wait, because I know you liked the Nexus 4,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.640]   and you Jeff still use the Nexus 4, right?
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   Mm-hmm, I do.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.400]   And I felt like this was in many ways a spiritual successor to the Nexus 4.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.840]   It's certainly in form factor.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   It feels the same.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.400]   It's roughly the same dots per inch.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.560]   It's a 4.7-inch screen.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.040]   It's a few dots per inch less, but it's, you know, 720p.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.120]   But it looks very good.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   It's a AMOLED screen, but not Pentile, like the--one of the reasons I didn't like the
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   Nexus 4 is I wasn't crazy about the color banning I would see in the Pentile display.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.640]   By the way, I have a phony launcher on here.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.160]   I have nova launcher, so it doesn't look like a Google experience.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   And I've added a lot of apps.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.800]   But if you go back to the way it came out of the box, there's only two pages of apps.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.600]   There's only two AT&T apps on here, my AT&T and the AT&T, a visual voicemail.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.400]   There's a couple of Motorola apps, both of which I think are good.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.840]   They're not clutter.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.280]   So it's about as close.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.360]   Yeah, and Nexus 4 wasn't--was not a Pentile screen?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   Was IPS?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   I was sorry, I apologize.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.840]   I thought it was for some reason.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   So this is AMOLED.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   Yeah, I had the Galaxy.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.080]   And I also had the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   I didn't have the Nexus 4.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   The Galaxy Nexus.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   That was the Pentile.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   Okay.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   Yep.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   Yep.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   So I think you'd like this screen.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   You're used to an OLED screen.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   You know, some people don't like OLED.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.920]   Same resolution as the screen, roughly as the screen you had.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   It's the same feeling.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   You know, it's sealed.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.680]   There's no removable battery, no SD card.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   And--
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.440]   So with that shipped with the default Android launcher, right?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   There was no--
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   It did.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   In fact, I can go back.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.800]   Yeah, I should go back to it because I'm giving you a false impression.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   I was curious.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   So--
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   I put Nova launcher on every phone eventually.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.480]   Yeah, because that's your--
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   That's my default.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   But I'll go back to the Android launcher.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.720]   This is the pure Android experience.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.560]   The Motorola features, the camera twisting, launching thing, and some of the breathing
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.000]   in and out, the listening, the Google Now is listening.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.760]   Are those in Motorola apps that are like in your app drawer?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   Are those just sort of running?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   What is it?
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.080]   Yeah, they-- well, they're in your app drawer.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.600]   You know, there's a part of your app drawer that's-- there's the downloaded-- here, I'll
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.960]   show you the app drawer.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.120]   And then there's a stuff that came on it.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.440]   A lot of it's called com.modarola.something.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   It's that kind of an app.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   It's an invisible app.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   Okay, so it's a process.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   It's a process.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   Running in the back.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   If you put another mod on this phone, would you lose those things?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   Yes, you would.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Right.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.800]   Unless that mod included it.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   So as far as I know--
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   It's so cool.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.760]   --and I'm going to give you the best information I have, and I'm not-- I may be wrong on some
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.800]   of this stuff, but as far as I know, the way it knows about the camera, which is the
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.680]   wrist flick, which launches the camera.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.120]   The way it knows that is there's a demon running that watches the accelerator.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.840]   So that's just a software demon.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.640]   The way it always on listening is a little different.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.000]   That is taking advantage of hardware feature.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.800]   This X8 processor set.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.280]   Two of the X8 processors are DSPs, one of which I understand is dedicated to listening.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.960]   And it's listening for just one thing.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.080]   So when you first get the phone, I can actually go through it.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   You train it.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   Use the touchless control, and you can train the launch phrase.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.480]   It'll do this out of the box.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.920]   So I'm going to do it right now.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   OK, Google now.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.560]   OK, Google now.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.480]   OK, Google now.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.640]   OK, Google now.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.160]   So you have to do it in a quiet room.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.440]   You do it three times, and now it's trained it with my voice.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.840]   So that's how it gives the voice distinctive listening, because it's my voice.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.080]   If you go, OK, Google now.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   It won't respond.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   You have to say it in your own voice.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.440]   OK, Google now.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.600]   And somewhat like, frankly, you said it on the training.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.960]   So it's just like if you ever used, like, drag and dictate, when you first train it,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   it's like that.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   You're the key phrase.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.680]   What happens if you have like, like, there inside this?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.400]   Well, for instance, the other day I train it, I was, you know, like, I'm like, I'm like,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.200]   in bed lying down, and it never worked again.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.560]   So I retrained it.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.120]   You want to like the supine, you know, right?
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.800]   That's probably something like this.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.920]   So you can you can train it again.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.200]   There's no I just train it again.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.720]   You can train it.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.000]   I trained it with a droopy dog voice, as you know, on Twitter, and it worked.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.560]   So you can train it with an oddball voice if you want.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.320]   It's very responsive.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.680]   Like seeing your you flip your wrist and say, oh, it's totally.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   I came up and said good afternoon.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   So the wrist flip thing, you have to shake it.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760]   Is it just one?
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.320]   It's three.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.800]   It's like this one, two, three.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.680]   And then it's very quick.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.280]   And the other thing that makes it fast for photography is it's tap to focus and shoot.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.120]   So you tap what you want to take a picture of and it does it.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.560]   I know why that's not going to go like this.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.080]   It's going to fly out of my hands.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.240]   But it's like a Nintendo remote.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.920]   You know, some people complain about this.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.840]   It's not a hard gesture to get used to.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.880]   It's pretty, you know, it works.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.280]   Once you use it for a while, it works 100% of the time.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.080]   And it's not like a there.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.520]   It didn't work, of course.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   It's not like it's you have to, you know, dislocate your wrist to have it to work.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.840]   But I like that so much so that I actually took the camera icon off of the dock because
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.080]   I don't think I'll ever watch that.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's the way you launch the camera.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.520]   So if the phone is locked and you do the gesture, does it give you?
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.160]   Yeah, it does.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   It does.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.880]   It's so stock that it's got the standard Android stock lock screen that you can swipe.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.120]   If you swipe right, you'll get the camera.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.480]   You swipe left, you can have widgets.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.920]   It's very stock feeling.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.640]   The differences are the camera app.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.200]   Unaccountably the calendar app is the older Google calendar.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.400]   Not the one with a nice new picker, but you just download the new Google calendar.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's the Google keyboard.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.800]   If you played with it, you'd say this is pretty much the same as a Google edition phone,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.520]   which explains why Motorola, at least, got Kawasaki, told me that they don't plan to
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   do a Google edition version of this.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.840]   That there will be a--
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.520]   They'll sell it on the Play Store, but they'll sell it like this.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.960]   But they're going to sell it.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   And here's my only issue.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   I'm going to get one.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   But.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   But.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.000]   And there was disappointment about the phone and over hype and this and that.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.440]   OK, I'm all right with it now.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   But my problem is that it's the carrier crap.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.840]   It's the carrier deal.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.520]   They will sell it.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.840]   They will sell it on an unlocked version.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   But you're right.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.760]   But then they'll only sell it on the 16, not 32.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.400]   Well, right now, that's true.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.880]   Right now, AT&T has a lock on 32 and has a lock on Moto Maker, the customization site.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.360]   Yeah, and that's what gets me.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   That's not going to--
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.960]   Well, I mean, you were probably going to run as I will buy it right away.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   I'll buy it right away.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.760]   So you'll have to go AT&T if you want that.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.680]   But I don't think in the long run you'll have to do that.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.680]   I think--
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   In fact, I got the strong impression that the exclusive is not for very long.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   No.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   But here's the issue.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.600]   Google says that they put the customer first, always customer first.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.520]   And when Google does that, they do that most of the time.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   Google wins.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.840]   It's every time Google puts the industry first that we lose.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   Right?
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.160]   That neutrality in Verizon, China, servers on your home server and Google fiber, crap
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.800]   deals with carriers.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   That's when Google loses.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.880]   When Google doesn't follow its own rule, then-- and we expect more of it.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   Right?
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.200]   I think of the old Motorola.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.280]   But now that it's Google, I expect that of them.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.600]   I'm totally-- look, I'm totally with you.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.400]   I don't think you need a 32 gig though, Jeff, just to--
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.720]   this doesn't respond to that absolutely accurate observation.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.800]   Google should be looking out for the customers first, not the carriers.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.240]   But it comes with 12 gig-- almost 12 gigs free on the 16 gig.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   And I've barely filled it.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.840]   I mean, unless you're going to--
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.040]   I've filled up my phone.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.600]   Yeah, but that's kind of an old usage model where you put a lot of media on it.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   What?
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.920]   You do because of the airplane.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   Yeah, I mean, I have to be on that.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.840]   I mean, you can get an airplane's worth of music on there easily in a few gigs.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.640]   You don't need eight gigs of music for a four hour flight or five hour flight or even a
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.200]   20 hour flight.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.560]   I noticed that I no longer fill up phones because I don't put-- I'm not putting media
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.160]   on there as much.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   I think this is--
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.320]   I don't want it to be these problems either.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.640]   Yeah, what this-- to me, there was a lot over hype.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.880]   And I unfortunately contributed to that by not being able to say anything.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.720]   And it turns out to be a brilliant strategy on their part.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   Brilliant.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   I'm never doing that again.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   That's true.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   I know.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.160]   But because people projected onto that, oh, it must be the greatest phone ever.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.640]   And that wasn't what was going through my head.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.040]   It was the more mixed reaction of.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.200]   There's some things I love about this.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   This is a huge step forward.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.400]   Remember what-- this is Motorola, folks, we're talking about.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.720]   This is a huge step forward from Droid.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.360]   Although the new Droid phones have that always listening because they're using the X8 chip
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   set.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   Right.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   And they kind of scooped the X a little bit on that announcement.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.800]   I like how this was-- how the X seems like the opposite of the Samsung GS4 launch.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   That's why I--
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   That's why I--
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Yeah, walk through of all these different apps.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.760]   I mean, on one hand, it's like, OK, you know, Samsung's taking a crack and becoming
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.120]   a great app maker, right?
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.520]   But I like that Moto X is so stripped down with a few kind of extras.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.120]   A couple of things I still want to see in stock Android.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.680]   That tapping anywhere that you find to take a photo, a fast burst mode in the camera, that
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   should be in the stock camera app.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.360]   I mean, I feel like the stock Android camera app is so ripe for so many improvements.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.560]   I don't-- I mean, the very few improvements they made in 4.3 just aren't enough.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.320]   There's a lot more that can be done there.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.800]   But of course, you have the special hardware, which is the point you're making in the pre-show
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   Leo, right?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.840]   You've got that special hardware on the Moto X where you can do the things like that they
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.320]   always listening and the accelerometer and the breathing thing.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   It's kind of like the Google Glass phone, isn't it?
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   Well, some people have said that, I guess.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   I mean, not having glass, I'm not sure.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   But that's what Scoble argues.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Yeah, and it's like--
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   I know.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   It's so used to voice games.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   Like, glass knows when it's on your head.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   And glass knows which way your head is turned.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.560]   He's listening.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   Well, actually, that's not true, is it?
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   Well, it knows when you--
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.800]   You have the tap glass to initiate that.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.480]   One thing that may not be clear for people, the Google now doesn't do anything different
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   on this.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.360]   The only difference is it's always listening.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.080]   All the commands are the same.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:44.040]   So for instance, on my HTC One, I've set up Nova launcher that when I just stroke it
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   up, it launches the always listening.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   That's the same.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   And now I'm going to have exactly the same experience as I have on the Moto X.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   So you have to touch the phone.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.840]   The only difference is you don't have to touch the phone.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   And if you lock it, by the way, all of that's off because now you have to unlock the phone.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.520]   I mean, if you have a pattern or a password, you have to unlock it before the always listening
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520]   goes on.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.240]   There is one exception, and I think some people miss the boat on this one.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.680]   I thought Joshua Tapulski-- most of the reviews I've read have been pretty right on.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.160]   Joshua Tapulski said, you've got to try this phone to really understand what it is that's
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.800]   so cool about it.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   He missed one thing.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.880]   He didn't mention the fact that when you're in-- you could set it up with an interested
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   Bluetooth range versus when I get in my car that it unlocks.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.880]   So as long as I'm in my car, it's unlocked and always listening.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.320]   So when you get out of the car, it locks again.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.840]   So the places where you want to talk to it, you can set it up very easily to talk if you've
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.880]   got Bluetooth in the car, I guess.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:53.160]   And the other thing was that they showed us but decided not to release-- I hear they're
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.800]   going to continue-- they are going to do it at some point-- a little clip that had a magnet
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.440]   in it to wake up the phone and an NFC to unlock it so that you could swipe-- you could have
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.680]   the clip on your clothes and swipe it that way.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.160]   You could have it in your car and swipe it that way.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   Oh, wait, Star Trek.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.400]   How Star Trek can you get?
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.680]   Yeah, I'm not sure why they didn't release it with the release of the phone.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.200]   They were showing us that.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.080]   And I liked that as well.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.400]   And you could buy multiple NFC clips so you could have it do some of this, make it more.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   So it's aware of where you are.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.800]   I wish that we're doing it with Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth because then it would unlock.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.520]   And I thought that they had told us it would be Wi-Fi.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.040]   I think there's stuff in here that they haven't quite turned on yet.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.080]   But the idea that you get in the house, you're within trusted Wi-Fi range, okay, I'll unlock.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.640]   You get in the car, you're within trusted Bluetooth range, okay, I'll unlock.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.200]   And you can keep it locked, which you should.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.560]   Every phone you should keep locked, I think.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.040]   But you could also use the always on voice commands.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.640]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.120]   I just think this motor, and it's made in America.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.400]   I think, you know, gosh, we talked so much about why does an Apple, on this show, why
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.880]   does an Apple make stuff in America?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.080]   What would the additional cost be?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.680]   Finally, a company, American Company Motorola does assemble a phone in America.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.760]   And it's just, you know, nobody, everybody says, "Oh, it's too much."
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.080]   That bit didn't get picked up very much.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   No.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.240]   It created 2,000 jobs and four words.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.560]   So it's assembled in Texas, right?
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.280]   And the parts are from overseas.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.800]   Well, some of the parts.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   But yeah.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   But there's no...
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   There's no...
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   There's no...
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   The company's done.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.880]   Nobody's making the rare earth pieces, the stuff that's...
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.360]   It's Samsung's making...
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.640]   Nobody's making these chips in the US.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.560]   Now, if somebody starts making these chips in the US, then they can be all US.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.120]   But, you know, no car is all US.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.200]   Nothing that's made and assembled in the US is 100% US.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.880]   Well, by the way, that whole movement bothers me a bit.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.200]   And you have to buy your strawberries in the US.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.080]   Well, what about the poor Chilean strawberry farmer?
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   He needs a job too.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.560]   Well, I think there's good reasons to buy local food because you don't have to ship it.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   It's environmentally, yeah.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   Well, no, there's...
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   If you go to the...
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.720]   The economics guys, and there's a lot of arguments to the contrary.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.320]   It's become cant religion.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.560]   But you know, we're in a worldwide economy and I don't think it's awful to help jobs
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.560]   around the world.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   Right.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   I think assembling America is good.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.400]   And I think it's an American phone company.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   But it does have to be true.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.480]   And I'm happy about that.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.960]   And I think they deserve some credit for that, right?
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   Yes.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.600]   And that may be part of the reasons why they're more expensive.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.840]   Although now I've seen stories that the carriers, one analyst said the carriers are probably
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.120]   paying about $350 for this phone.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.480]   Which means that they're making some good money on the $200 subsidy.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.000]   And in fact, could charge less and may well charge less.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.640]   You might see the phone dropping price pretty quickly.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.800]   But that was one of the complaints too.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.200]   Hey, it's a mid-range, mid-range specs for a full price phone.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.320]   Same as a GS4 or the HTC One.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.880]   But first of all, I don't think it's mid-range specs.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   I think it's a pretty impressive specs.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.680]   Because of that processor.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.880]   Yeah, it doesn't feel really.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.040]   It's easy to judge a phone until you've held it and used it, then judge it.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.640]   It's easy to say, oh, but it's not slow.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   And the screen looks great.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.320]   I don't see any negatives to the way they've designed this.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.600]   I would have loved, for instance, wireless charging.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.560]   It doesn't have that like the Nexus 4 did.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   But there's no room.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.720]   They try to put more battery in here.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.040]   They're doing that battery thing where the battery's here and the motherboard is right
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.680]   against the screen.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.280]   They've designed a curved battery so they get maximized the battery volume.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.160]   There was no room for a Qi charger, I guess.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.960]   So that's fine.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.280]   Now, the new LG phone has a 3000-man-ing.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280]   Right.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   It needs it.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   You know why?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.800]   It's got a 5.2-inch 1080p screen.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.120]   So that's the other reason for 720p.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.400]   So the battery life on this is great.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   It's 18 hours.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.000]   I just rock solid 18 hours.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.520]   LG says more than 24.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.760]   Yeah, because they got a giant battery in it.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   Well, this says 24/2, right?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.320]   Yeah, I was going to say that says 24, right?
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   So you got 18.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.200]   I just saw Brian Kluge from Monantec saying, I get about 12, no matter how hard it tries.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   I don't know if--
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Oh, no, no.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.920]   In fact, let's look right now.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   I'm pretty consistently getting 18 hours.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.520]   And you know, it's a new phone, which means you use it more than you would later on down
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   the road.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   I use it like crazy.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   So it's 74%.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.760]   It's been off battery for three hours.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:41.880]   So that's 12 hours if you just multiply by four.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.400]   But of the 68% of screen time, I've got an hour and a half on screen.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   That's the big battery drain is a screen type.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.320]   So in normal reasonable use, it's been 16 to 18 hours, really consistent.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   And that's all I require.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.240]   I want 16 hours because that means I sleep for eight hours.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   I get up.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.880]   I unplug it and I can go to like go back to bed.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   That's what I want.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.160]   16 hours is what I want.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.720]   And I get that consistently on this.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.640]   The always listening does not hurt it.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.800]   You've got the GS4, the HGC1 and the Moto X.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Yes.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   What's your primary phone right now?
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   It sounds like it's the X.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.600]   It has been the X, although I really like the HGC1.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.040]   The Galaxy S4 I lent to IAS because I can no longer use it.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.840]   It's got, you know, what a start using a phone.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   You cannot go.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.960]   Well, I can, it's a locked bootloader and a triangle away is not available yet on the
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   GS4.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   So I'm kind of stuck.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.120]   I can't modify the firmware.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.200]   I did root it, but I can't modify the firmware yet.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.440]   I'm, you know, this is a big change for me.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.680]   I'm coming to become a fan of the Google experience.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.760]   When I talked to a rich, what's his name?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.200]   Overholt from Motorola, who's the guy who did the demos for everybody.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.040]   He said, he says, I'm the guy who invented blur.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.600]   And he said, we had to because it was Android gingerbread was not good enough.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.680]   I would also argue that care that phone manufacturers did that just to make one version of Android
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.880]   different from the other so they have a distinctive version.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.080]   But he said, he said he felt quite comfortable shipping a almost pure Android experience
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   because it's come such a long way.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.000]   And I'd agree with him.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.600]   4.22 and even more 4.33 is a very mature OS.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.160]   I think it's very, very good.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.320]   You imagine how much splain he had to do when Google bought them?
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.880]   Yeah, yeah, I invented it.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.800]   But really, it's okay.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   He left.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.000]   He left for a while and then came back.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.120]   I can't remember the story, but I think he came back when during, after the acquisition.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.160]   But yeah, I can't remember the story.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.000]   I think that this isn't the best phone in the world.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.320]   There is no perfect phone.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.520]   There really isn't a perfect phone.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.880]   I think it's a very good phone.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.560]   And I think it will particularly appeal to the people leaving the iPhone.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.680]   I think that's really what Motorola is trying to do.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.000]   This is the, it's not an iPhone killer, but if you're moving to Android from an iPhone,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.520]   this is certainly the one you should get.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   All right, since I don't care about anybody else in the world, only me.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.680]   I'm going from the Nexus 4 to this.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:28.560]   That's why I bought an X is 4 because then I got curious that maybe so I bought an X is
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.880]   4 which comes Friday.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.560]   So I can't answer that because I feel like from what I know about the Nexus 4 and I've
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.400]   played with one a lot of people around here have them.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.920]   But I didn't use it for any length of time.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.520]   I feel like this is the logical successor.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.800]   On AT&T, it's not LTE on T mobile.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.880]   You can turn on the LTE though it doesn't have another radio for that or someone who
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   appears or something.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   The Nexus 4 does not raise LTE.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   Right, right.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.680]   So yeah, and this will be LTE on AT&T.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   It's fast too.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.080]   It also supports 802 to 11 AC and I was getting 50 megabit downloads and 20 megabit uploads
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.840]   off of my AC router at home.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   It was very nice.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.120]   So Gina, any buyer's remorse doesn't sound like it.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   No, I'm okay.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   I'm good.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   I mean, I'm curious about the X.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.840]   I would like to hold it and try it.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.120]   But hi, I like my one and there's, there's the X sounds really sounds cool.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.960]   There's a couple of nice features there.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.400]   It sounds like it is sort of the spiritual successor to the Nexus 4.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.160]   Maybe that's what the X stands for, the Nexus.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.480]   But I'm happy.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.120]   I like the one a lot, especially now that it has four, three and it fixed that one.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.400]   There's one bug with Google Play movies that we just fixed now.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.960]   I really like the speakers on the front.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.440]   I really like the design of it.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.200]   I don't mind swiping up for Google now.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   So you always listening is, you know, not a big deal for me.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.080]   I am pretty good.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.600]   I'm not too bad.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.640]   Not as bad as it could have been.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640]   I was worried.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   I had you worried.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.720]   I think the speakers alone, if you use the speakers, that's enough reason to stay with
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.480]   the one because the speaker on this is loud, but it's tinny.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.840]   It's not a great speaker.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.560]   So the one really there's nothing better in terms if you use it.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now a lot of people say, who uses the speakers on their phone?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.320]   I use headphones or I put it in a speaker.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.520]   But if you use the speakers on your phone, then absolutely.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.480]   There's no, the one is a killer.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.040]   And yes, you do can you can see the difference in the screens.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.440]   The one screen is pretty incredible.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.920]   I mean, it's more than 400 dots per inch.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.520]   And while they say you can't tell the difference, there's something you feel about it that you
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.560]   can tell, you know, I don't know what it is, but they're just now notice they're equally
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   fluid.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.880]   There's not any hesitation or lag on either of them.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.600]   I think performance is good on both.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.920]   It's the one, a little taller.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.400]   Oh, yeah, it's bigger.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   Yeah, it is bigger.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.640]   The screen's the same size, but the physical because of the speakers and when I installed
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.400]   my app, I could see a whole other task.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   Like I was like, I can, I can, I noticed that the space, you know, the port was so much
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   bigger because I see more content.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Of course, I saw, you know, insidaneously in my own app.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.200]   They look at so much.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.560]   I, you know, from a pure aesthetic point of view, probably the one is hardware wise and
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.040]   is absolutely superior.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   It is.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   No question.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   It's a phone.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.600]   Now I asked Guy if he can get me the wood back one and that might change my perception
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   of the Moto X.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.280]   They're going to make it, they're going to make it with teak, ebony, walnut, they're
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.680]   going to have different wooden backs.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   I don't get it.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.840]   Like I just, I don't know.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   It's like a woody.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.880]   No, you know, the car wouldy.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.040]   No, she doesn't know what you mean, Leo.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.680]   You know, country squire, you know, she doesn't know what you mean, Leo.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.280]   We're going to have to talk about their, their ad marketed their campaign campaign.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.720]   Oh, you know, cause they were, they were, they did some sexy ads for the X, which they
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   pulled.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   I know, I know.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   And they said we've got wood.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   On our Twitter and they pulled it within like an hour.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   They realized it really wasn't quite.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   Now that's chemorphism.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.800]   Oh, actual wood.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.120]   Now, what is an ice material?
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.640]   I really like wood and I think it would be kind of an interesting material for a phone.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.040]   This, what does, what is true about this is it's smaller and it feels good.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   And there it is.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.400]   Guy had a wood back.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.920]   It feels good in the hand.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   Look at that.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   Is that not beautiful?
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   So there's four different colors.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.080]   The darker, the darker wood is actually, you can get teeth.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   Doesn't look so crazy.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   It's kind of nice.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.320]   And ebony, which is black.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.840]   If this phone is this phone and it's something that you don't know from the specs or from
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.720]   reading about it feels good in the hand.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.320]   It's the right size.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.080]   It's the right texture.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.520]   I'm not going to want to put a case on this.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.400]   I really like that they said that they focused on the user experience and not on specs.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   Rightly so.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.600]   I thought that was the right, it was a good, that was the right approach.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.200]   Rightly so.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.280]   And you make a little sacrifice for better battery life like the lower quality screen.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.800]   But you know, no, no, I like cheat charging.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.960]   I wish everything had a wireless charging.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.400]   Everything should have wireless charging at this point.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.440]   I feel like any of the phone that ships right now should have.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.520]   I bought cheap pads for everywhere.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   Just set it down.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.360]   I think I went upstairs, downstairs in my house.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.600]   I got one in my office.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.240]   It's barbaric finding outlets, plugging things in, looking for adapters.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   It's barbaric.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   How medieval.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   It is.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.320]   It's medieval.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.240]   So I guess if you ask the question, I wouldn't get a Galaxy S4.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.840]   It's because maybe the Google edition is okay.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.280]   Although it's very plasticy feeling.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.720]   I would get an HTC One or a Moto X.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   You got it.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   I would try the Moto.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.440]   I would go to a store and try the Moto X, see how it feels.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   Because I think that that's hard to.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.400]   Now, we still have an iPhone 5 coming in the fall, probably.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.560]   The G2 doesn't, from my LG, I'm not, that looked like they're trying to be a Galaxy S4.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.440]   But to me, they went the wrong way.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.080]   They customized it more.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   Nexus 5, probably.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.400]   I don't know if there's a Nexus 5.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.880]   What is the point of the Nexus program?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   There's two fold.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.640]   One to show phone manufacturers how to do it, right?
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   Well, this does that.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   The Moto X does that.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   Reference phone.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.240]   The other is to make a cheap phone for developers, which is still the Nexus 4.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.720]   And I see no reason to replace that.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   If you're a developer, it still does the job, right, Gina?
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   That 4.3 on it?
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.120]   Yep.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   Yep.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.480]   Any of the Galaxy Nexus gets got 4.3 as well.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.400]   So I think that they have a developer, a cheap developer phone.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.480]   I don't think they need that.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.200]   I sold four things on eBay.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.080]   My gadget fund is back up.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.760]   I'm ready to buy the LTE Nexus 7, but I don't know when.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.200]   I'm ready to buy the Play Edition of the Moto X.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   I don't know when.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   I've got my consumerism is going nuts.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.600]   Just burn a hole in your pocket.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   I just buy it all.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.280]   I solved that.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.360]   To me, the psychological angst is worse than the money.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.800]   I just throw money at them because I don't want to have the angst.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   You got angst.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   No, no, I'm ready to buy.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   Oh, you're ready.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   I don't know when.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.640]   You know, Google, can't you just tell us when the LTE Nexus 7 would be available?
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   Just tell us.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   Soon, I think.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   Next couple of weeks.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.720]   I'm going to be like, "Look, look, look."
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.520]   Love the Nexus 7.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   "Shush."
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   You'll love it.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   No, you'll love it.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   I know.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   I know.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.520]   I'll be happy.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.040]   You'll be happy.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   Let's take a break and we're going to come back with a changelog.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   How about that?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   Gina Trippani.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   Sounds good.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   All righty.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   All righty.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   Our show today brought to you by the good folks at Shutterstock.com.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.120]   If you are in the creatives, create a professional as your blogger or videographer.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:05.720]   If you make, you know, you got Facebook, you know, anything where you need beautiful images,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.840]   stock photos, illustrations, vectors, videos, you really ought to know about Shutterstock.com.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   Even if it's just for inspiration, even if you never buy anything, go to Shutterstock.com.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840]   You can create an account for free.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.200]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.760]   You can play with the search tool, which is so great.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.680]   You could take a look at the huge variety of images available on Shutterstock.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.920]   What's nice is once you've got an account, you can say to the, say, "I want to save that
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.200]   image to my light box."
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.960]   You can either share the light box with a colleague or a friend or just save it for
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   inspiration.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.360]   Oh, I, you know, believe it or not, if you're a writer or a blogger, it's really nice to
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.200]   have these images for me anyway because it stimulates a part of my brain that gets me
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   more creative.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.880]   I start thinking and you can really do that with Shutterstock.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.000]   Just play with it.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   The search tool is so cool.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.840]   If you've got an iPad, you've got to try the Shutterstock iPad app, which is a Webby
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.920]   Award winning, just fabulous, fabulous app.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.680]   These are royalty free, by the way.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.640]   You can use them in your blog, in your, if you want the videos and your videos, anything
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   you want.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   I'm going to log in because I love Shutterstock.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.840]   I want to show you what it looks like.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.720]   I gave away my credit card number today by accident.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.680]   I'll talk about that when we get to the Chrome story.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.080]   So here's what I got for you.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.920]   Visit Shutterstock.com to create, look, see here's inspiration on the interior's search.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.000]   You can get inspiration for like your apartment.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.160]   It isn't just for using this stuff.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.080]   It's for all sorts of purposes.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   Here's the deal.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.040]   You can try it for free.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   You can create an account for free.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.720]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.260]   But if you say, gosh, I really would like that image for my blog, for my Facebook sign
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.920]   in, whatever.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.400]   We've got some special deals for you.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.600]   You can buy image packages or a subscription, which I have.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.440]   And you're going to take 30% off when you use our offer code.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.280]   Twig 8, eight for the eighth month, we're in August.

[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.400]   If you want to get 30% off your first purchase, Shutterstock.com.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.600]   We thank them for their support.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   Of this week in Google, and now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the change log.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.080]   And here she is.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.880]   There we go.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.480]   That wasn't going to say anything.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.040]   Geez, that was going too fast for me.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   It was blinking.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   It was over.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   A backwards change log.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   I'm going to get your penny with what's new at Google.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.320]   Kind of a thin change log today.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.960]   We've got a few items.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.160]   Google launches real time, real time API for analytics.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.080]   This is an invite only beta at the moment and mostly applies to web publishers, but
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.120]   I thought it was really kind of cool.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.160]   Once you've access to this real time API, you can make queries about your data, what's
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.920]   going on in your site in real time.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:11.000]   So you could do something very basic like add a visitor live visitor counter to your site,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.960]   or you could have an app notify you on your Pebble Watch if you've got a peak visitors,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.800]   for example.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.920]   Or if you're getting a ton of traffic from, say, Reddit or I don't know, dig, you could
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.240]   dynamically add a Reddit button or a dig button to your site when you see that traffic.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:34.920]   So kind of cool stuff for web publishers who are expanding their audience.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.760]   Google Search has added a new feature on Google.com in US English.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.960]   And this is in-depth articles.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:47.840]   So Google's research showed that 10% of searchers are looking for kind of long form in-depth
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.360]   information about big topics like, I don't know, gender or censorship, or one of their
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.000]   examples, Lego, which I appreciated.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.920]   So if you do a search for Lego or gender or censorship, you'll get a section of in-depth
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:08.080]   articles which I guess Google has editors there picking these out in the side of the
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.720]   main column of the search results kind of scroll down the page.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.040]   And there, you know, long articles from reputable sources that kind of do deep dives into the
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   topic.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   So yeah, they can't have editors doing all that.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.160]   They must do it by brands or something else.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.480]   You probably write this gotta be some sort of algorithmic thing going on here.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.560]   Let's see if they say in the blog post, they've got humans doing this.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.040]   It doesn't make sense that they would.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.480]   Otherwise it doesn't scale.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   It doesn't scale exactly.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.080]   It's a crunch to post on this.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.440]   Not clear how Google will determine an article is in depth.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.520]   But yeah, ranked algorithmically based on amazing--
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.520]   I think it's some question of yeah.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:36:01.040]   It's the brand, it's the length, it's citations, probably the easiest one to start off with.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.160]   Yeah, and it sounds like publishers can mark up their pages, optimize the markup on their
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.320]   pages to get accepted into this program.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.400]   So publishers should ensure the articles follow general guidelines, including pagination markup.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.560]   Look who they got, the Smithsonian.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.400]   They got business week, they got New York Times.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   Yeah, I don't think--
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   Heavy hitters.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.680]   I don't know if we were gonna have a shot at that.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   We ought to.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   And--
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   And--
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   And--
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   And--
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   And--
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   And--
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   And--
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   And--
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   I'm still pissed that I'm not even in Google News because they still won't do single author
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   blogs.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.280]   Or at least at one point, it required that every URL has some sort of alpha numeric, like
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   unique alpha numeric string in it.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.200]   This is-- we were trying to get a life background forever.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.560]   And I think finally we did get in, but they had some weird requirements.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.280]   I didn't know that about single author blogs.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.760]   So it doesn't make sense.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:59.120]   Finally, Google launches a city experts program to encourage higher quality Google+ local reviews.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:05.520]   So if you want to earn yourself, get yourself some Google swag, get writing your reviews.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.280]   So this is limited to cities in the US, select cities in the US, UK, Australia, and Japan.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.160]   And it rewards users who've left at least 50 reviews to date and who produce at least
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.560]   five new reviews each month.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.000]   So you've got to be a really active Google+ local reviewer in order to qualify for this
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   program.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.080]   But those users who do this meet these guidelines, they get perks like access to local events
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.840]   and custom swags or basically Google brand and stuff and special online recognition.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   So Google's--
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   Google City experts.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:41.640]   Again, a little human interaction here or human intervention, but volunteer users.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.440]   This is user-generated content.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   It's interesting.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.800]   And check it out at google.com/local/contest/cityexpert.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.120]   That's all I got today, a pretty short change log.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.200]   Play the change log trumpets or timponies.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   There you go.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   The drums.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   And the drums.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.560]   Thank you, Gina, and Trippie, honey.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   Huh?
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560]   Thank you.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   You're welcome.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.560]   This Chrome Passions.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   All right.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.080]   Yeah, I think this is kind of-- we talked about it on security now, so--
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   You're over it.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.720]   You're like, that's so-- you're like, I haven't talked about the Moto X and Chrome.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.960]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.320]   I wasn't sure what to think.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.680]   I think he's better informed now.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   I'm better informed.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   Yeah, definitely are.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.640]   So let me just show you what it is.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.720]   If you're using Chrome and everybody knows this, I don't know why this is suddenly a story
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.360]   except it must be this slow season.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.800]   But when you go into your Chrome settings, I will not log into Google just so that you
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.560]   show-- see what it looks like whether you're logged in or not.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.480]   When you're growing your Chrome settings and you scroll down to the bottom and show advanced
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.240]   settings-- by the way, Firefox and other browsers do this as well.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.600]   You'll see a password and forms-- let me make it bigger so you can see it-- password
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.200]   and forms section.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   There's Offer to Save Passwords I enter on the web.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.160]   And then there's a button that says, Manage Saved Passwords.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.400]   So if you let-- by the way, if you're worried about this, uncheck that box.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:13.360]   But if you let Chrome save your passwords, then when you go into Manage Saved Passwords,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.080]   you'll see dots next to the passwords.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   You can show this.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   I don't think this is anything important.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.280]   Oh, I meant this is a Motorola Connect launching on this.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:31.080]   It's a Chrome extension that lets the Moto X text messages I can send and receive from
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Moto X.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.920]   It's kind of like a branded Mighty Text.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   So let me go back to the settings.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.240]   Pulled me out for a moment.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.920]   Back down to Advanced.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.320]   Back down to Passwords and Forms, Manage Saved Passwords.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.000]   You'll see the passwords.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   You'll see the dots.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   You can show this.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.320]   And then when I click the dot, there's a Show button that shows what the password is.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.880]   And it shows it in clear text.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:01.360]   So the Verge and others of Twitter went crazy.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.800]   But you have to understand that this requires that somebody have physical access to your
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.080]   computer and that you're logged in onto that computer and that you've been using Chrome
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.600]   to save the password.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.640]   Same thing happens with other browsers.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.040]   When your email window is probably already open on the computer with--
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   If somebody has physical access to your computer, you have far bigger problems.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.960]   But-- Okay, so I see that and that was Google's justification, right?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.640]   They said Google said, so first Firefox does this by default, but it has a set master--
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.800]   You can set a master pass, right?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   And that was a big--
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   --many of my articles were--
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.840]   Security reveals some time ago was-- and it was worse when Firefox because they stored
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.800]   the passwords in the clear unless you use that password.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.960]   So everybody turned that on, I presume.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   Right, right.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.880]   So you could turn that on, but Chrome has not done that.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.520]   And their reasoning was-- until I get this wrong-- but they said that master password
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.720]   does it help and we don't want to give users a false sense of security that their passwords
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   are actually safe using that master password.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.600]   The reality is if somebody has your access to your computer, then--
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   It's screwed.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   Your screw.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.560]   Because the browser has to be able to send the password to a site when you log in, so
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.920]   that password has to be available to the browser.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.240]   So don't just leave your machine on and logged in.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:28.280]   By the way, here's Safari and you'll notice that I'm in the same kind of section of Safari,
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.680]   all the saved passwords, and there's a show passwords button.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.920]   Now Safari does the same thing Firefox does when I click show passwords, it says you have
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.640]   to log into your account again.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   Well, and that's a keychain prompt.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.120]   Is that a keychain prompt?
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.960]   OK, so that's something.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.200]   I'm surprised that there's an-- I like to see the guy play.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.880]   It sounds kind of flimsy to me because Chrome doesn't just run on our computers.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.240]   I mean, it also runs on our phones.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.960]   Is that how it's going to work on our phones as well?
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.720]   So like if someone has your PIN code?
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   I don't know.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.120]   I don't save my passwords in Chrome.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.480]   I use LastPass and you need a master password in order to get into LastPass.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   Right.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.560]   And that, I think, is what Google's saying is if you're saving passwords in the browser,
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.160]   it's inherently risky.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.960]   So you should be saving it-- use LastPass or turn off browser saving, which I always
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   do, by the way.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.320]   I mean, with LastPass, if I've got Chrome open and I've authenticated with LastPass and
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.280]   the tool bar is there and I walk away from my computer, then anybody can get into LastPass.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.040]   I have to close the browser or log out of LastPass.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.520]   And I'm not sure how what my LastPass settings are, but I think you can set how often--
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   Yes, you can.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.920]   You can make it authenticate every time if you want.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.040]   I just feel like this is the roommate, siblings shared.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.440]   It just seems like there's so many opportunities in which someone could--
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:51.320]   Yeah, but you understand that they also have access to your email.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.640]   They also have access to your hard drive.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:00.040]   They also have-- I mean, they've got everything.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.040]   Right.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:06.200]   They've got-- they're physically-- so if you log out of your computer, for instance,
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.320]   and you don't-- but this just reminds people, you should have a password on your computer,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.360]   you should have it log out when the screensaver comes on or you walk away from it.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.480]   You shouldn't have it automatically log in.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.880]   If somebody has physical access to your computer, you're at risk, right?
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.600]   I just-- I just seem strange that Google wouldn't have added on, "Hey, log in.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.640]   Hey, just log in with your Google account to show us who you are.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.880]   Like, just make sure that you are who you say you are."
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   Right.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   I mean, that's the crux of the debate.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.200]   You're saying, "Why not just add an extra layer and let people do it?"
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.520]   And Google's saying that it leads to bad habits.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.720]   And I'm not sure where I come out on that.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   Let me think about that.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.720]   I think Google's--
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.480]   That would require-- if you do that, that means that you would have to have a Google account
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.360]   to have Chrome-safe passwords.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.160]   Yeah, and that's--
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   Don't you?
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Don't you?
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.320]   At least you have to have a Chrome profile.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.520]   You at least have to have a Google account to use Chrome and have it safe passwords now.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   Do you?
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.160]   I don't think the passwords are tied to your Chrome-- to your Google account.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   Why, you see that?
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   Mine's going to be because one line is mine.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.040]   Mine are because mine goes across machines.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.840]   And if you turn on syncing, but that's because you've turned on syncing.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   Yes.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.920]   So now you're turning on syncing and you're authenticating with a password which can be
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.080]   your Google password or not, by the way.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.560]   It could be anything.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.560]   Oh.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.560]   Right, right.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.480]   So I'm just-- you have Safari prompts you with Keychain and Firefox gives you at least
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.000]   the option to set a master password.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.320]   It just surprises me that Google--
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.880]   Yes, Safari's doing the right thing, but that's because it's written by Apple.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   Right.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.400]   It's using the fact that it knows it's going to be on Apple to store the passwords in
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.040]   an Apple OS-provided safe store, secure store the Keychain.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   Right.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   I wonder what Safari's going to do.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.600]   Firefox can't do that because it doesn't know what operating system it's on.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.480]   Chrome doesn't know what operating system-- so it can't take advantage of an operating
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.000]   system feature like that.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Right.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   System level.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Right.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.560]   So Safari is more secure in that regard.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:13.520]   I don't-- you know, if somebody has physical access to your logged in computer, they can
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.520]   put a keystroke logger on there.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   Your hose.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   Your hose.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.200]   There's so many things they can do.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.000]   Or your phone or your glasses-- well, maybe not your glasses.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.640]   Well, that's why I said you shouldn't have a lock on your phone.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   Should let your phone go around.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.600]   That's actually far more effective though.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.800]   Every time my phone goes off, it comes back unlocked.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.360]   I can leave my desk at the office with my machine open for-- and I don't have it.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   Right.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   You're going to go off.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.000]   I guess-- I mean, Google could address this and I bet you they do with a LastPass style
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   password store.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.800]   Heck, they could even do it with touch screens.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   They could even do it with a swipe.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.080]   Right.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.000]   So they could totally do this.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.680]   But I just feel like it is kind of misleading to say, well, we're going to secure it and
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.160]   in case somebody has physical access to your computer because there's so many other things
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.600]   they could do anyway.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   It just makes me nervous.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.160]   It just makes me nervous that the tech-- that the passwords are stored presumably, you know,
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   kind of in the clear.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.920]   Well, they're not stored in the clear.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.400]   But the browser has to have a way to un-encrypt them otherwise.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Right.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   They couldn't send it.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   It shows them in the clear when you click show.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   So you have to click show.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   So it's probably doing some sort of hashing them, some have to doing it too.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   Right.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.640]   Yeah, they're not stored in the-- now that was the flaw that Firefox had earlier.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.280]   And maybe they still do.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.880]   If you didn't password your password store, you didn't put an additional-- it was on the
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   hard drive in the clear.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880]   Right.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.680]   Which is the same as having a passwords.txt file on your desktop.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   Right.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   That's a real flaw.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.600]   And that's why we always told people, and I presume that that advice still applies, if
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.440]   you're letting Firefox store your passwords, give it a password to protect it.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.640]   People doesn't offer that kind of protection, but I presume that it's-- and I'm sure this
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.360]   is the case where we would have heard about it.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.680]   It's not storing your passwords in the clear on the hard drive.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   Right.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   Right.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.680]   Right.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.280]   So Steve was just-- he didn't think-- he didn't think that Google was at--
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   Not at all.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.680]   He said this is bogus.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   Sure.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   Their responsibility on this one.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.680]   He said this is bogus.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Steve is OK.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   All right.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   If Steve's OK, then I'm going to go ahead.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:30.720]   If you really have a world of hurt, if somebody's got physical logged in access to your computer,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.280]   the least of it is getting your passwords out of your browser.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.480]   There's so many, so many things they could do to you.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.880]   In seconds, much faster, frankly.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.680]   What are they-- so they got an open Chrome, get in there, take a screenshot, mail it to
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.680]   themselves.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   What are they going to do?
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.880]   Or if they bring along a USB key, they can put malware on there in about five seconds.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.160]   You don't even download the malware.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.080]   They can go to a known infected site and infect you.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.800]   There's so many ways to do this.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.400]   I guess the legitimate point would be that Chrome could do this better.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.840]   But I understand Google saying, well, there's a tradeoff to doing that.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:11.200]   And it doesn't make the fundamental situation more secure, which is that somebody has access
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.320]   to your computer, unfettered access to your computer.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   Right.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.120]   I mean, I guess you could make the argument that it would be for PR more than anything.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   That's why they would do it.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   Right.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   We fixed it.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   Right.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.160]   Yeah, but then-- yeah, but I could copy your entire hard drive and go home.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.160]   Right.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   So, you know--
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.600]   Not on my Chromebook, you can't.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   Right.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:42.200]   The real good advice is don't use a browser of any kind to store your passwords.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.600]   Use LastPass or something like it.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.960]   But LastPass I know is safe and doesn't store your-- you know, it's highly-- it's encrypted.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.520]   And if they get access to your hard drive without your LastPass password, they can't-- they
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.520]   can't do anything.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   Right.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:07.360]   It's kind of equivalent to this two-factor authentication thing where you can say, no,
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.600]   I always use this computer.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.360]   So don't ask me every time I use it.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   Right.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   Right.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.400]   You could say, oh, well, you know, that reduces security.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.440]   Yes, because the presumption is this is a safe computer.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.480]   They even say, if this is not-- if this is a shared computer, don't use this option.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   Right.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.960]   Well, if it's a shared computer, you shouldn't be storing the passwords in your browser.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   Same thing.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   Right.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.720]   If someone broke into my home and carried the computer off, I got bigger problems.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.720]   Might as well just take the computer.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   They're really after you.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   It's all on there.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   Right.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   Right.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   All right.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.720]   All right.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   Okay.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.880]   What I do would be to use LastPass only turn off browser storage.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   I do.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.840]   Because I don't want-- and that, then you're much safer.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.520]   And by the way, use two-factor authentication on LastPass and you're really good with Google
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   Authenticator.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   And then you're really good.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   I don't know.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.680]   I think it's a tempest in a teapot.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.720]   Steve seemed to think so as well.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.520]   It's interesting that Google made such a different choice than Safari and Firefox.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.760]   Well, no, Firefox is doing pretty much the same thing.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   I mean--
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.240]   Well, in that at least Firefox is like, oh, here, here, you can set this master password.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.240]   Google's just saying outright.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.440]   That's not going to help you.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.880]   Well, that was less controversial than I--
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   I wonder-- so if you aren't logged in at any-- see, I'm always logged in on Chrome.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.040]   If you're not logged in any way, it will still offer to save passwords.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.880]   I'm going to do incognito window.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.520]   Well, well, that wouldn't do it either.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   That wouldn't do it.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   So a new profile, right?
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   Switch profiles.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:06.640]   So Heli at Kember, who wrote this blog post, said, you know, the-- there are two sides
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.920]   of this, the developer side and the user side.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.120]   Anytime I try to draw attention to this, I get the user response from technical people.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.360]   Just use one pass.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.160]   The computer is already insecurities as you have physical access.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.360]   That's just how password management works.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.040]   He says, well, all of these points are valid.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.840]   This doesn't address the real problem.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:32.800]   Google isn't clear about its password security.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:43.400]   By displaying your passwords in plaintext outside your keychain without requiring a password.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:48.720]   And then Justin Shoe, who's head of Chrome Security responses, is just not going to change
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.880]   your wrong.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:56.560]   And Steve had kind of the same attitude like, well, of course not.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.160]   Anyway, hey, now you know.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.520]   And that's the best thing.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   Everybody now knows.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.400]   She just disappointed.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.280]   We didn't have any cause for fits or anything.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.040]   But I'll bring you a cause for a fit.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   OK.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.040]   Ready?
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.440]   I see J.I.S. will have a fit right here.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.840]   No, that's not that one.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840]   I got so many.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   We've got more than one.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.360]   This is a quick fit.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:24.000]   Katie Couric just tweeted that she has years free Chipotle burritos.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.560]   What are we, Choppeliver Tacos?
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.120]   Well, she is on a major.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.480]   Isn't she on a major or maybe not?
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   What have we done for them?
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.760]   And you know what folks, I don't want the burritos.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.840]   I want advertising on twig.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.680]   Katie Couric is about four feet tall.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.280]   How many burritos could she eat?
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   Not many.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.600]   That's why they're like, they're not looking at me saying, we'll give him free burritos
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   for a year.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.240]   Oh, no.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.800]   Are we still Chipotle fans?
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   I was there.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.520]   Ah, it's it's Wayne for me.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.160]   Yeah, like Lee, much like Lee.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   It's Wayne the little bit.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   Lee and Chipotle.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   We've got to find new stuff.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Yeah, we do.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.880]   So if you are, OK, so I created a new Chrome profile.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.680]   I'm not signed into Google.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.400]   I just signed into Netflix.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.040]   It's random and it did offer to save passwords.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   So you're right.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   This is not connected.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.640]   This is not at all connected to whether or not you're signed in with Google.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.120]   So Google could not use Google sign in to to verify your identity.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:23.000]   It just saves because everybody expects a browser to save passwords.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.120]   Like my mom would go crazy if the browser didn't save passwords.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   So Bob's big boy and let's see.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.200]   What was it that you liked?
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   What was that show you like?
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.040]   We don't have those out here.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.600]   Let's show you didn't want to admit you like the Bachelorette.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.760]   No, Bachelorette.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.240]   No, Bob's big boy in the Bachelorette.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.720]   We'll replace Glee and Chipotle.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   How about that?
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   No?
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   All right.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   Five guys.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   No, five guys.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   Is that safe?
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   I like five guys.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   Do you have five guys?
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   Okay.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   Okay.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   We can make it five guys because they're nationwide.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   Out here.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.720]   We can do it in Alex's not.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   No, it's not out there and White Castle's not out here.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   So it's so hard that you're faster.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   Take that Chipotle.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.720]   And Katie Kirk, your girlfriend, she holds up the card with a jar of thumbs.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.960]   Now how's that fun?
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.240]   Oh, that's good advertising Chipotle.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.040]   You got to be really happy about that mention.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Huh?
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.040]   I tell you, these celebrities, they're so used to getting the gift baskets, the free
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.040]   stuff.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.840]   They just don't appreciate it.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.280]   The Moto phones before anybody else.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   Oh.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   You know, it turned out I was somebody tweeted me.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.160]   There were apparently two Moto events.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.000]   I went to the first one, which was the, yeah, the blogger.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Oh, there she is.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Hello, Katie.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   She's.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.560]   I stole like you, Katie, but Chipotle has got me.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.560]   Come on.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   Really?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   Really, Katie?
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.560]   Come on.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.720]   It's made out of wood.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.280]   I didn't even know they had that.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.960]   Free as free Chipotle for, I see we got her name on it.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.400]   Katie Kirk's custom made burrito card.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.880]   Handcrafted.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:16.200]   You know, free birds to free birds, I say.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:21.280]   Well, I just, it's like, I'm not surprised at Chipotle doing that.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.680]   I'm surprised at her making a big deal out of it.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:33.040]   Don't you know, Katie, we celebrities have a code that if you get free stuff, what, you
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   know, what happens at Chipotle stays at Chipotle.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.580]   I swear.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.820]   You think they paid her?
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.800]   Did they pay her, you think?
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   Did you get any money?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   No, she got free burritos.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.280]   She might have, they might be average.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.640]   Which means she's cheap.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.480]   She doesn't cost much.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.600]   A few free burritos.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.880]   Free burritos, I mean, because I'm honest, seriously, how many burritos is she going to eat?
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:59.440]   So Porter Gale, who is a publicity person, went to the second event.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.080]   And Kristi Yamaguchi was there.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.120]   All these famous people were there the next night.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.200]   So clearly Motorola, a guy Kawasaki had a clever strategy.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.160]   Bloggers night one, celebrities night two.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.200]   First the slabs and then the stars.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.640]   And guess, according to Porter, they didn't have to sign an NDA.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   Whoa.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   Huh?
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.760]   Well, because they figured Kristi Yamaguchi is going to be listening to her anyway.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.800]   She could have started her own EV leaks Twitter handle.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   Kristi Yamaguchi leaks.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   An odd celebrity list guy.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.160]   Well, I should get the, I don't have the whole list.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   Porter wrote an article.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.720]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:49.640]   She wrote an article about the Moto X launch in which she talked about to drop the name
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.400]   of all the celebrities that were at hers.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.480]   And you know, the title of her post was how Google enlists bloggers to spread the word
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   for Moto X.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.920]   But then when I saw who went to her event, it wasn't bloggers.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   It wasn't bloggers.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.760]   It was like Kristi Yamaguchi and her, I guess her, let me see if I can find the list.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.560]   She mentioned, it's dropped all the names here.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.800]   There were no NDA forms, no security checks, no formalities.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   Kristi Yamaguchi and her hockey playing husband, Brett Hetikan, a champion Frisbee player.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.760]   A pretty low level celebrity list.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   It was like B-list.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760]   Okay.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   Well, it was B-list bloggers too.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.960]   So David Kelly, the founder of IDO.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.240]   It was like the celebrity one.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.800]   I wanted to go to the celebrity one.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.800]   Next time guy.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   Okay.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.280]   There's something, there's got to be something more to tell.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   There's no next time because there's no NDA's for you.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.160]   Handheld, I know, never again, handheld remote for Google Glass.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.360]   This one says Jarvis will have fits.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.000]   So instead of having, well, I will you have fits.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.440]   This is called remote and it allows you to keep it, keep your hands in your pockets while
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   you're wearing your glass.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.240]   I can't remember what I was going to have a fit about.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.320]   Oh, I may have done some doc rundown organization and missed that.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   Oh.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   Oh.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   Oh.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   Sorry.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   This is not.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.120]   It's the street view story.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.320]   But the, so you can navigate glass directly.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   I mean, discreetly.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.240]   So you can take pictures with anybody knowing.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.760]   No, it's actually something you got to hold.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.160]   So it's, you can hold it in your pocket.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   That's true.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   Which is even creepier.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   But it's kind of ridiculous.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.960]   If you think you need, that means they made a mistake on the UI.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.200]   It's a wide, it's a wide story.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.160]   Yeah, because you just do the blink side load.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   Now, just killing me.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.880]   I can't remember what I was going to have a fit about.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   Hulu.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.880]   How about this?
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.840]   Hulu plans to put Hulu Plus on Google Chromecast.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.720]   That's good news.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.440]   The more stuff I see on Chromecast, the happier I am.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.440]   I've been really digging it.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.440]   You like it?
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.440]   Really digging it.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   I just use it for music all the time.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.880]   I mean, I've been using it for Netflix a lot, which is, I know that I have, you know, 17
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.200]   devices in my house that could probably play Netflix.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.840]   But I just been, you know, TV's been HBO.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.280]   HBO Go says they're going to do it.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.920]   Vimeo, they already announced Pandora.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   They already announced.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Yep.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.560]   And Tonya Amazon streaming.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.560]   That's all I'm missing.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.560]   Yeah, Amazon streaming.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.560]   True.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.720]   Chris Jep's a little busy now with the Washington Post.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   Oh, that's a story.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.720]   There you go.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   There's one to ask.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.720]   That's really sorry.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:25.440]   What does Bezos want with a dying medium?
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.440]   We have no idea.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.360]   Let's be very clear about that.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.920]   There's a lot of speculation.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   People are gossiping.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.000]   You know, one reports that he wanted their delivery trucks.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.400]   No, he doesn't need their delivery trucks.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.600]   He's got something called Fed X.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.280]   That's ridiculous.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.840]   So what I'm doing, what I consider instead is what I hope he does.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.760]   I've been arguing you've heard me blather on about how our business should be about relationships
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.800]   and he understands better than anyone else how to build individual relationships and
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.960]   thus deliver relevance and value.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.520]   Jeff, please do that.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.760]   He understands how to build platforms so people do stuff around him.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.480]   Please do that, Jeff.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.240]   You know, I hope that he can really reconsider how it operates from the scratch.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:14.680]   Calla Canis, a newsletter sent out, a great newsletter saying it's crazy.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.760]   He says, look at all the ways newspaper sucks to own a newspaper.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.040]   Craigslist takes all your classifieds.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.640]   Nichesites take your audience and your top journalists.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.320]   No one wants dead trees on their doorsteps.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.440]   News breaks is processed and largely resolved in the same day on Twitter.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.840]   Some of the countries last units are grinding down already, ground down newspapers.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840]   Can't disagree with all that.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.280]   He gives six theories.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.720]   Go.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.480]   He says, given the Red Sox guy bought the globe, right?
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Newspapers are the new sports team for the billionaire set.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:53.080]   Chris Hughes bought the New Republic, the Facebook CTO bought the New Republic.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.400]   Bezos is buying influence in Washington.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   I don't.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.080]   Calla Canis would be much cheaper just to buy more lobbyists.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.080]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   250 million.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.360]   You get a lot of congressmen for 250 million.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.720]   You buy the whole damn thing.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.600]   News paper delivery, Trojan horse for daily home delivery, that truck theory.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600]   No.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.320]   Bezos will run for president.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.680]   He wants a bully pulpit in DC also silly.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.120]   Legacy challenge.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.840]   And this is the one he says makes the most sense.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.000]   Bezos bought the Washington Post because journalism is important and he wants to figure
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   it out.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   That's kind of what you were saying.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.280]   Maybe he's got a secret plan.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.200]   My fear, I have two fears about it.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   I'm generally very hopeful about this.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.560]   And I'm an admirer of what Bezos is building.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.600]   The one fear I have is that as a reporter said to me an act of philanthropy.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.400]   He'll just sit back and say, "Okay, I saved it.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   I'll write the checks."
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   And that doesn't do anything.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.880]   It's cigarette money for him, right?
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.800]   If he truly brings in innovation, that's what we need.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.120]   The second fear I have is how secretive he is.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.960]   And newspapers need to be open, run openly, and I want his innovation to occur openly.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.600]   But it's a different world for him.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.240]   I'm hopeful, I find it fascinating that the Grahams basically had to admit they had no
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   strategy.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.120]   And so they had to find somebody who they thought couldn't invent a strategy for it
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.160]   because they were capped out.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.160]   And so I'm hopeful about that.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.040]   Is the New York Times strategy going to be successful?
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   Because they have a strategy.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.680]   They have a digital strategy.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.680]   They have a digital strategy.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.360]   They have a different strategy because they are an international strategy now.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.160]   Now their national strategy clearly works.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   And they have a successful paywall, one of the few.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.200]   Yeah, there's still a little bit of debate about that.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   Yeah, it works, it brings in some potential money.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.720]   And they're going to try to expand internationally, though I think that's going to be harder for
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   them than they know.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   They're going to compete with the Guardian and BBC.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:46.320]   I think newspapers can be at best national.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.640]   Well, the Guardian is a third of its audience's US.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.480]   A third is the rush to the world and the third is UK.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   Really?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.920]   And it's grown incredibly because of the net.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.240]   So the Guardian's international, BBC is a news brand is international.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.760]   CNN is a news brand is international.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.680]   Though small, Wall Street Journal less so FT, Wall Street Journal FT are more specialized.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.320]   It's possible, it is a very hard thing to do.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.080]   It's very hard to monetize.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.880]   The mirror is now very big in the US because it has celebrity gossip.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.320]   I'll stand corrected.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.200]   I guess you can do international.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.680]   You can, but it's hard.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.160]   The problem with the post was, and I know this from friends who were there, that the
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:34.600]   war that lasted until now was a war of are we local or national?
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.840]   The equivalent to that was are we print or digital?
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.120]   It was probably one of the few local newspapers with a national reputation that didn't become
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   national.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   Right.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.680]   Yes, the LA Times wanted to be that.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680]   Couldn't do it.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   Ridiculous.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680]   Stupid.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.680]   The Times has done.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.480]   But the CEO of the post was not too long ago still doing power points about the wonders
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480]   of print.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.600]   The sales force, the sales national stuff, we want to sell local.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   That was the war that was on there that they never settled.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.520]   No, I'm now welcoming new owner.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.680]   He's going to say, "Listen, this is what we've got to be."
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.320]   I think Jeff Bezos is philanthropy.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:21.440]   I can't imagine that a guy like Bezos who's so smart and has really figured out the future
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.640]   of merchandising and it's online has any interest in the most bricks and mortar, bricks
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   and mortar businesses.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   Well, but he does.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.320]   If I argue that news is a service, he understands service.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.920]   But what do you need to know the paper for?
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.400]   You don't, but you have the brand and you make it into something new.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.840]   Yeah, you get rid of the newspaper as soon as you get.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.160]   I think the brand is an Albatross.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   Really?
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.720]   What do you get with a name Washington Post?
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.920]   The only thing ever comes to mind is Watergate.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.240]   He could have bought Woodward and Bernstein cheaper and it would have been better.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   Right?
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.720]   Well, Jeff has another problem here, which is that who are newspapers, advertisers, local
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.120]   merchants, who is Amazon killing?
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.120]   Local merchants.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   Right.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.560]   Macy's is not going to advertise in a Jeff Bezos owned Washington Post.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.520]   By the way, Amazon didn't buy WAPO.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   No.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.520]   Jeff Bezos did.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.240]   But same difference.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   Same difference.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.920]   I totally think it's an act of philanthropy.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.440]   It's an act of nostalgia.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.680]   It's like Henry Ford buying a locomotive.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.560]   It's like, well, that it's amazing that Buffett isn't what it bought.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.320]   Buffett left the board of the Washington Post.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.640]   Buffett made some money on this deal.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640]   And yeah, he did.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640]   What did he make?
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   Like $100 million or so?
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.960]   He made a huge amount of money on this.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   So you know what?
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   Warren could have gone to Jeff.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   It's a Jeff.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   Would you buy this?
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.200]   Well, I think Warren did have a role in that.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.520]   I don't know if it's called Bezos, the best manager in America.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.520]   You know what?
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   Warren's a smart guy.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520]   He went to Jeff.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520]   He's a strow.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   He patted him.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520]   Now here's the point.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520]   Now here's the point.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   You're the guy.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   You're the guy.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   Run this.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   And then he comes home with a big check.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.200]   He doesn't have the headache of having to worry about a dying medium.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   But here's the point.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.000]   Jeff, if you want to buy something, you know, AM radio, it's going to be big.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   It'll be huge.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   The right leadership.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Just with the right leadership.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.480]   Oh, it needs his leadership.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   Just get Marissa to buy that.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   You know, here's the funny will.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.400]   Who is on Graham closer to than Jeff Bezos?
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   Who?
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.400]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   He's a board of Facebook.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.240]   Imagine if the news had been that Mark Zuckerberg is why I had the Washington Post.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   It would have been hilarious.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.040]   It fits everywhere.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.040]   Very interesting.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040]   It's not enough for that.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040]   Enough about it.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   I was going to have a fit about it.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   Now, see, no, you didn't mess it up.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040]   What are you going to have a fit about?
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.040]   Google the Castro's house in Cleveland.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.440]   The guy who held the three women hostage for all those years.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.640]   Not hostage but prisoner.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.320]   And the town destroyed the house today.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.320]   That's a very smart thing.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.520]   But before the house was destroyed, Google blurred it on Street View.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520]   What?
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.400]   What are they protecting us from?
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.440]   What are they doing to the record?
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.200]   You know, should they blur the world trade center of site too?
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.840]   Because it's not a pleasant memories.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.560]   It's not a good Google to do that.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:20.440]   We're not warm and eat, and I was a bit offended by their censorship of the real world.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.760]   So I just wanted to say that.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.760]   It's not a full fit.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.920]   Yeah, that seems weird to me.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:38.840]   I mean, unless there was someone in the window, it doesn't seem like any reason why I should
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.480]   have done that.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480]   So that's the end of my fit.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   That was a very nice--
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   So they leveled the house?
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   I didn't realize that.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   They leveled the house today.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.240]   Yeah, which is a fun thing to do, I think.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.800]   But one of the victims was there to help, but I certainly understand that desire.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.520]   Oh, I'm happy to hear that.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:02.360]   What do you think was-- I mean, maybe there was-- oh, I know it had Christmas lights on
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   it.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.640]   No, that would make no sense.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   By the way, I have.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.120]   I just received.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.720]   This is something we'd like to offer, Katie, correct?
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.720]   Yes.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.040]   Free tweet episodes for you, Katie, for life, not just a year, forever.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.600]   It's made of wood.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.440]   And I just want you to know that this is waiting for you at the Twitbird Cast, Katie.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.040]   As long as you tweet about it.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:27.880]   And no thumbs.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   That's my only condition.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.800]   Christmas scene of the guy who invented the hashtag is leaving Google.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.280]   He's going to start-- join a startup named Neon Mom.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   I like Chris a lot.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   Yeah, Chris is great.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   I like Chris a lot, too.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.160]   And I like Chris when he's talking more, when he's blogging and he's more.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   He's out there kind of.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.080]   And when he was at Google, it was sort of a little bit of a quiet period.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080]   I felt like--
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080]   --here for my very most.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   Maybe that's why you left.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   He just wanted to talk.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.000]   It was he who, on Twitter, first had the idea that if you put the pound sign, the hash sign
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.840]   in front of a word, it would make it easier to search for tweets about a certain subject.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.080]   And boy, has his baby taken off.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.360]   Arguably even more successful than Twitter itself.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.360]   You see him everywhere.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.480]   You can't watch a TV show without a hashtag.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.640]   I just saw a picture of the Portland police car with hashtag Portland police.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.120]   Alex Baldwin was on Howard Stern a week ago.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.600]   And after he's gone through all his Twitter cruffles, he said that he imagined his gravestone
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.440]   would just say hashtag dead.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.000]   Do you think that will live forever or as hashtag just, you know, moment in time?
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Good question.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.720]   That is a good question.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.280]   I think that it's had a pretty good long moment.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.920]   Wouldn't have predicted that, would you?
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.360]   Yeah, no, I wouldn't have.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.120]   I mean, certainly a longer moment than say like QR codes or, you know, I don't know.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.000]   It lives in history, no doubt.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Right.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   Occupy Wall Street, things like that.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   It lives in history.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.560]   But it is a ridiculous cluge on a limited system.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.560]   Right.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   It is.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.320]   Well, no, because it's just--
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.440]   You know what, at signs live, right?
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.480]   For email and now for Twitter.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480]   It's a signal.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   It's a signal.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:21.080]   What follows is this is the canonical name for something in a namespace, @lialloport
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.600]   in Twitter, the namespace, or leo@twit.tv in the Twit.tv namespace.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.680]   And what hashtag says is this is a search term.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.080]   And it would be fruitful for you to search on whatever follows the hashtag.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.400]   I think it's just a signal.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.600]   And it's a brilliant signal.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.680]   It comes from the notion of taxonomy.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.840]   I mean, you can really credit in some way, Katarina Fakas to her Butterfield for creating
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.400]   taxonomies in Flickr, which were the logical predecessor.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.200]   They didn't have the hashtag, but same idea.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.600]   You tag a photograph because you can't search on it when you can't now with Google.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.520]   But at the time, you couldn't search for the contents of a photo.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.800]   So the hashtag was so critical.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.400]   Well, was the way to create a few more of you?
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   Licker or delicious.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   Delicious.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   Did Josh do it first?
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   But it was a lot of people.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.120]   It feels like Flickr predated delicious, but I don't know.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.280]   They're both killed by Yahoo.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.280]   That's all I know.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.320]   But Yahoo is getting a new logo, by the way.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   What?
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320]   No purple?
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.160]   Yeah, I guess they're working on a new logo.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.760]   God, I bought the whole staff purple t-shirts, hoping that Marissa would buy.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.560]   So we could have that picture that everybody does, you know, the entire team in purple.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560]   I don't know if they're going to ditch purple.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.240]   And I don't think they're going to ditch the exclamation point either, which was my only
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   really interest.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.440]   Because that's such a pain in the ass.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   All right.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.800]   Let's take a look at the new.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.600]   This is from the Washington Post, the nation's new paper.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.960]   Bezos paper.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.440]   The Bezos, the Washington Bezos.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.200]   The Bezos Daily.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.040]   They're taking down the sign.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.080]   That's the old picture of the famous San Francisco Yahoo sign.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Where's the new?
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.280]   I don't see the new logo in this Washington Post.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.160]   They're putting a new logo up a day for 30 days and then we'll see it.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160]   Oh.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   Right.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   It's a 30 day countdown.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.760]   So on the site, I think there's a new logo a day and somebody said a new logo we shouldn't
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.920]   care about because we know it's not the logo.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   No kidding.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   30 bad logos.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.920]   That's weird.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920]   This is the video.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920]   It's still purple.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920]   I mean, we're talking about it.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.920]   We're doing a good job.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.920]   I mean, we get rid of-
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.760]   I don't like today's at all.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   But you know what?
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.760]   This is Marissa.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:37.280]   She was most famous at Google for her, you know, the design sense of the Google homepage
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.520]   and she would obsess over the different shade of blue.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.120]   So this is just typography.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   Come on.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.360]   You're going to be doing what you did.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.160]   I want to be rid of the dog's member.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.960]   Let's get rid of the dog's member.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.560]   Seriously.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.760]   The current today's is ugly.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.720]   Let's see this over here.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.720]   It's ugly.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.360]   Let's castrate the Yahoo logo.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.280]   Bad kerning.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.960]   And still has the dog's member.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.640]   I mean, if there's a girl on the app, they've got to say go back a show.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.960]   If you don't know what a dog's member is, you're not missing anything at all.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   No.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.280]   Not at all.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.040]   Anything else we should talk about before we get to our picks of the week I'm looking
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   at.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.560]   I think under the security, there's one least amusing thing here, which is the former NSA
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:33.800]   chief, Haydn warned that if Snowden got apprehended, that there'll be cyber attacks
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   on everything.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.520]   That's where all people are able to hit.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:42.160]   And he called our people, our nihilists, anarchists, activists, loves, economists, 20
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.120]   something's who haven't talked to the opposite sex in five or six years.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.720]   This guy, this is straight out of Dr. Strangelove.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.760]   Practically talking about precious bodily fluids.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:01.600]   So are these people and why are they running things so depressed by that story?
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.440]   It's really hard for me to be chipper right now.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.980]   Because I wrote a post in the Guardian in which I argued that it is time for the major
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.680]   tech companies to come forward and make clear whether they are collaborators or because
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.000]   of the NSA's overreach.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   They're collaborators.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.120]   And they're all Bruce Steyer then wrote a wonderful post to that said we've got to restore
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.120]   a trust in the net.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.840]   We're going to try to get Shania on next week and have him talk.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.280]   Because he's the greatest.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   Love Bruce.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   That'd be great.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:37.080]   Nihilists, anarchists, activists, lolsec, anonymous, 20 something's who haven't talked
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.640]   to the opposite sex in five or six years.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.120]   They may want to come after the US government.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.480]   For frankly, you know, the dot mill stuff is about the hardest target in the United States.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.960]   Oh, don't say that out loud.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.880]   So if they can't create great harm to dot mill, hey, who are they going after?
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.080]   Who for them are the world trade centers?
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.720]   Oh, this guy, this guy should not be allowed to speak.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.520]   But he ran the NSA.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.600]   Oh, they're the wagons are so circled.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.960]   The big question is whether the whole kerfuffle right now about about security in the Middle
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.200]   East and US embassies is I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   I never have been.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.600]   I always presume the world is not that well organized.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.800]   But I now my faith is shaken and I wonder whether they're they're not pumping this.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.400]   We look what we found.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   There's chatter.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   You see it works.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.400]   We found chatter.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.240]   But of course, of course, Snowden stopped them from talking the same way.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.880]   So we don't know the great thing today was Daily Beast has a story that that OK, the
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.640]   reason they got all this was OK, they held a conference call, which led to all kinds
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.520]   of great Twitter jokes about, you know, Oh, don't you hate this whole music?
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.520]   It makes me so angry.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.280]   I want to blow up the world.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.760]   Oh, so Gibson was talking about this.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:16:00.200]   On the previous show on security now, apparently a few months ago, the FISA court ruled that
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.200]   what was going on was unconstitutional.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   So the all the report was classified.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   Yes.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.800]   Yeah, you can't see it.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.600]   The court has no objection.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.320]   Government will not enough.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.400]   Yeah, it objects, but no, you can't see it.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.520]   So the secret court has to stay secret.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.520]   Sorry.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.440]   One more little thing, Leo, I suppose we shouldn't follow up because it amounts to I should have
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.440]   worn Chad to cue this.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.320]   The Leistung Schultzberg.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   That just imagine if you will some reggae going on, right?
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.240]   So so if you to refresh your memory very briefly, the German publishers went to the
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.160]   legislature that got passed a law that says, you can't quote us.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   You can't snip at us.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.320]   You can steal our soul.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.720]   And so Google said, fine, we won't.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.080]   You have to opt in for us to quote you a link to you.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.080]   Good.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.160]   Every sale publisher, including actual Springer, the one that started all opted in.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.880]   So that's one German publishers, Bobkiss.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   I think that's exactly the way to handle it.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   That's fine.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   Yeah, no problem.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   No problem.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   No problem.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:14.800]   Yeah, that kind of shuts up all the, all the criticism.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.000]   We're going to take a break when we come back our tool tip and number of the week.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.400]   And don't forget coming up in just a few minutes, triangulation, Stuart Schofe.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.000]   We'll join us the host of the longest running computer television show of all time, Computer
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.680]   Chronicles, which was started in the mid 80s, I think.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:37.000]   And it'll be great fun to see Stuart here in studio in just a moment.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.560]   But first a word from hover.com.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.760]   If it's time to register a domain name, stop.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.360]   Don't go to the place you always go.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.280]   Go to hover.com.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.760]   They've taken domain name registration.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.040]   They've made it simple.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.840]   They've created domain management that is easy and powerful.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.440]   There's no upsell.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.720]   There's no BS.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.600]   It's friction free.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   And you're going to love it.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.040]   They just launched Google Apps for Business.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.960]   So you can add it to a new domain or to one you already own through hover.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.200]   That's fabulous.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.520]   There's no heavy handed up selling or aggressive cross selling.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.720]   They don't believe in hiding functionality or requiring payments for things that should
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   just be included.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.600]   For instance, privacy.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.760]   You know you want to heal who is privacy.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.000]   Well it's built in.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.320]   Hover provides it automatically.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.760]   Subdomains, automatic URL forwarding automatic.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.720]   Hover only offers services that enhance the domain name experience.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   Not a lot of upsell.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.560]   They don't do hosting.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.960]   They only partner with companies they believe offer value.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.680]   You can get all the big top level domains.com of course.net, which is a great alternative
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.680]   choice.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:46.680]   You can also call it.com.com or go to www.com.com or go to www.com.com or go to www.com.com.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.520]   It's a great one.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.280]   You'll see a lot of.net choices still around.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.760]   We're kind of moving over from.com.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.480]   All the good ones are taken on.com.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.640]   Great online helps support documentation tutorials.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.620]   They even have a concierge service that will move your existing domains over.
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.440]   That's the way to do it.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440]   Hover.com.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:12.280]   One of their selling points is in a no-hold, no-weight, no transfer phone support.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.400]   When you call during business hours, you'll be speaking with a live person who has empowered
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.960]   and eager to help you.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   Hover.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.880]   Created by two cows, this is their new thing.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.760]   Elliot, Noss, and Kruger are just trying to take businesses that are so poorly managed
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.520]   and just begging for fixing and domain name registration.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.520]   Absolutely one of them.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.960]   I want you to try it today.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.800]   Visit hover.com/twig.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.760]   You'll get 10% off your domain name registration.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.600]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.600]   People tweet me all the time.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600]   What was the name of that domain?
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.600]   Register.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600]   You recommend?
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.600]   Remember hover.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.440]   Like a little hummingbird.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.920]   It's time for Gina Trapani's tool.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.160]   I'm sorry, tip of the week.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.600]   A little tip this week for people who spend a lot of time in Google Docs like I do.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.920]   I spend a lot of time in Google Docs and I often have to link stuff.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.360]   You hyperlink, if you will, if you want to go back to 1993.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.520]   Certain words.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.880]   There's a quick shortcut to do that now.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.960]   If you type a word, say you type "twit" and then you select it and this is in Google
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:22.160]   Docs and in Google Slides, Google will actually show a drop down with search results with
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.840]   the likely search results like "twit.tv" or maybe Wikipedia on Twitch right there in
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.840]   the drop down.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.120]   You can click on the link to link that word.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.160]   This is a new thing and this is something I do in Google Docs all the time and it always
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.400]   is the, like, so you have to open up another browser tab and do your search.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.800]   This all happens inside Docs now.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.800]   So I'm going to try.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.560]   Next time you want to link some text inside, Google Docs or Slides.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:47.200]   I'd like to see this happen in sheets soon as well.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.840]   What a great idea.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840]   Help doing the rundown.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.280]   Cool.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.520]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.160]   I'm going to go back up here and, you know, just as we move from Chipotle and give up
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.840]   on them because they were nice to keep the correct not us.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.400]   And we've picked five guys burgers.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   Yes.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   I'm off it already.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   I'm off it already.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   You're done?
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   I can't wait.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   I'm going to Brynburgers.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   Bryn, what's that?
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   Brynburger.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:19.040]   Sergey spent $330,000 to subsidize the creation of this test tube burger.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.120]   Oh, yay.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.840]   It's meat made in the test tube, not by a cow.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.840]   Exactly.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.600]   So the idea is, well, evidently, you miss the fat.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600]   Well, they can add fat.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.680]   Yeah, but they can.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.760]   I could be could just do some lipo on the cow.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   Wouldn't kill them.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.720]   You can recycle yourself.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   Or yourself.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.720]   Even better.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720]   Take the fat out.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   Put it in the burger.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.720]   Eat it.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720]   Take it out.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720]   Put it back.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   It works beautifully.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   Even better.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   Where is one of these?
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   Can I go now?
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.200]   No, they did have a tasting.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.520]   Some some some press went.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.720]   I always wondered why.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.440]   I really always wondered why you have to have an animal make your meat.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.320]   Why can't you just grow it in vats?
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.360]   Well, that's exactly what he's doing.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.840]   Let me put it up.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   I'll put it in the mouth.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.840]   You got to admire these guys because they're just living the science fiction life.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.840]   They are.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   Live in the dream.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840]   Are you a vegetarian gene?
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840]   No, you eat meatballs.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   No, I'm not.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840]   I do.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.840]   I'm an omnivore.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.280]   See, then it would be that you could be a vegetarian with conscience because no animal
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   was killed.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.520]   No, there you go.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.320]   It seems like it would also be more efficient.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.040]   You have a video and the chat on the rundown.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.720]   I put a video and I just found of I haven't watched it.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.720]   Sergey explaining why he did this vegetarian meat.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.640]   Oops.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.120]   It's very clean.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.040]   Oh, here we go.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.360]   Sergey paid a hundred.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   How much?
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.720]   $330,000 for a hamburger.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720]   That's co-baby.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.000]   Oh, we're going to get an ad first.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Sorry.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   I know the-- it's six minutes.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   We got to watch a six-year-old.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.720]   This is how Sergey is paying for the beef.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.040]   I like to look at technology opportunities where the technology seems like it's on the
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:14.160]   cusp of viability and if it succeeds there, it can be really transformative for the world.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.840]   The story of human evolution.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.840]   Is it made of people?
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.760]   So I'm agreeing.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   I always wondered that.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.840]   I mean, but I'm the one who's advocating for a human chow.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.360]   We got puppy chow and gorilla chow.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.000]   You know, zoos for years have been able to feed animals with a nutritionally complete
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.840]   food.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.960]   Why don't we have human chow?
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   Just asking.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.200]   We just eat it.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200]   It would be easy.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   Somebody's making--
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.320]   Tom who makes soil and purple.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.560]   Dr. Mom says we do have human chow.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.360]   She is in our chatroom or regular.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.640]   She, her specialty as a physician, is feeding people through tubes and debating people and
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.640]   feeding them.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.880]   I guess that's what they would pump down the tube is human chow.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   Yeah, human chow.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.920]   Well, maybe it wouldn't be good.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.080]   It's not in sure, is it?
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   No.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.240]   My tool of the week is something that's been around for a while, but I finally just kind
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.240]   of got around to try it.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.360]   I'm so excited about it.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   It's Bluestacks.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360]   You know about Bluestacks.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:26.240]   Android emulator for Windows or Mac lets you literally run Android apps inside of your
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.720]   Mac or your PC.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:33.240]   For instance, I'm going to search for my favorite app, TappedOut, which I can't play
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.240]   anymore.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.600]   It's safe for me to search for it.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600]   When you do that, it'll show you three different stores that you can install it from.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.840]   Oh, I have to enable the app store.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.040]   I haven't enabled it on this one.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.240]   I won't do that right now.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   But you see, this is Android.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.440]   I mean, it's really an Android experience, which is--
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.080]   So, and you then cast that on Chromecast to your big TV?
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.680]   Oh, that would be cool, but no.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.680]   It's not an browser, though.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.680]   Not an browser.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.680]   Tab.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.640]   But maybe the Bluestacks folks will-- that would be a nice thing for them to do.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.880]   Maybe Bluestacks folks should add a Chromecast button to your Bluestacks.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.480]   This is Android running an emulation.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.880]   I don't know what version it is.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.720]   You know off the top of your head, Gina?
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   I don't.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.800]   It doesn't say.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.440]   But I was running Tapped Out at Home, and it ran fine.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.160]   I mean, it crashed because my Tapped Out crashes.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.600]   But it ran right up to the point where it would normally crash.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.600]   It ran fine.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.480]   And other apps-- the most popular apps on here are games.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.240]   As you might imagine, wouldn't you like to be able to play some of those great Android
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.400]   games on the desktop?
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.040]   Some of those Android games are actually better than the games on desktop computers.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.600]   So Bluestacks is free from Bluestacks.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.760]   I think it's .org.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.560]   Let me check.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.520]   But I really-- somebody sent me an email saying, you know, you should just be playing
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.920]   the Simpsons on your computer.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.160]   I knew about Bluestacks.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]   I've done it bad for some time.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.160]   You have Bluestacks.com.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   .com.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   Play bigger.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.160]   That's very cool.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160]   Very cool.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.720]   10 million downloads.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.960]   So I guess I'm not telling you anything.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.400]   Available for Windows and Mac.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.120]   It works just fine.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.480]   And yeah, it's a great idea.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.080]   I'll put my tap down on here when it gets back.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   You know what, crash.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.360]   Electronic Arts ripped me off.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.880]   They owe me 1,400 donuts.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880]   Aww.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   I know.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   Jerks.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   Jerks.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   Jerks.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   Jerks.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.440]   Jeff-- no, actually, I'm relieved.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.560]   I was badly hooked on that show.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.120]   It's good to not be able to play it anymore.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.240]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts and what
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.400]   would Google do.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.920]   He blogs at Buzz Machine.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.000]   Do you still blog right for a medium as well?
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   I do.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   Another place you can see.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.680]   Does everything at a medium show up on Buzz Machine or is there unique stuff?
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680]   No, no mix.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680]   Mix.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.680]   Cool.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   So go to both places.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.120]   Jina is, of course, the author of ThinkUp.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:09.200]   ThinkUp.com, the great Twitter statistics analyzer.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.840]   And to do text, a great to-do list for both iOS and Android.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.240]   And blogs at smarterware.org and is the mother of Etta.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.960]   Yes, theoretically blogging.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.560]   I'm going to kickstart my blogging soon.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.560]   That's been a job.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560]   Yeah, I've heard it all before.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560]   Blogs lacquer.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.920]   Blogs lacquer.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.080]   We all are these days.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.600]   Every time, every three months, I write an entry saying, I'm going to do this every day
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.600]   from now on.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   Every three months.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.440]   Like clockwork.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.360]   And Katie Kirk, don't forget.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.480]   We still got that wooden free Twitter.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.200]   Get out of jail free code.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.280]   We do this week in Google right after security now on Wednesdays.
