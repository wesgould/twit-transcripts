[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.200]   Google Gaga.

[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920]   to show the covers Google and the cloud and joining us right now.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.720]   Starting in my upper left-hand corner we've got Gina Trapani.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.200]   Hey Gina.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.960]   Hello.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.600]   From smarterware.org.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.160]   Great to be here.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720]   Great guests, excited for a good show.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.440]   I got an email from Steve Martin who said he hates backup of five,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.240]   but he's really happy with ThinkUp.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.120]   Awesome.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.960]   I love to hear that.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.080]   So you have a fan.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.640]   Awesome.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   Yes.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.440]   Yeah, he's probably going to send you a plastic bunny ears
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   or something as a thank you.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.440]   I would love that.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.680]   It's kind of really getting emails from Steve Martin.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200]   I have to say, it's kind of awesome.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.680]   It is.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.000]   More than awesome.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.320]   Yes.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.400]   Also with this, actually another great guest in studio,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here as usual.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.440]   But look at that guy who is right, Andy Carvin.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   Everyone also here.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520]   Andy's the guy we keep promoting on the Twitter.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.440]   What's your title at NPR?
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   Senior strategist.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.160]   That's how I react to it.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   Are you a journalist?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   Are you a journalist?
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.320]   I do a Middle East coverage.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840]   Are you a journalist by training?
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.280]   I'm a writer and documentary maker by background
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   but have worked in online community organizing,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.920]   going back to the mid '90s and also doing a lot of online disaster
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.400]   response.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.440]   So this is the second nature for me.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   It's just focusing on news and reporting instead.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800]   We've mentioned many times that if you follow a Carvin on Twitter,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   you will get an amazing curated list of links and tweets
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.520]   and a very interesting material on--
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.200]   well, did it start with Tunisia?
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760]   You've been doing it for a while, I guess.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   Yeah, I started in Tunisia just before Christmas.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.640]   And since then, it's expanded to, let's see, Egypt, Iran, Yemen,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   Bahrain, Libya, Morocco, and a few others.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.920]   And Japan.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.760]   And Japan.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.000]   You're Mr. Democracy plus Tsunami.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.520]   Yes, something like that.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's really--
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   I mean, I couldn't be more sincere when I say
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   that this is something everybody who is interested
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   in these breaking stories should follow.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.480]   But I think we talk about it a lot.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   I know Jeff does because it's a totally new way to get information.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   It's a new form of journalism.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.760]   Well, I think the thing that's new about it
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.800]   is on the one hand, it's like I'm using Twitter
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.160]   for doing live anchor coverage like a broadcast
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   and a live anchor.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280]   But rather than relying on producers and editors
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.080]   and researchers to the information,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.040]   I just ask my Twitter crowd because I'm essentially
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.880]   a one man band.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.640]   I don't know everything.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.840]   I don't even speak Arabic.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so if I start hearing things from a particular place
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.760]   in Libya or Bahrain, I start asking for assistance.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160]   And people come out of the woodwork
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   to help me figure out what's true and what's not.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.720]   And of course, the crime of it is,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   while Charlie Sheen has well over 2 million followers,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.800]   you've only got 37,000 followers.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.680]   And yet it is arguably one of the richest Twitter streams
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.360]   out there for real content.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.040]   So thank you Andy.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.560]   Thanks.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   Every time I've warned Andy on the show,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   I talk so fast that I get tweets the next day saying,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.760]   who is that guy again?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Who is it?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.400]   Right.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.680]   A-C-A-R-V-I.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   And it's easy to remember, just think of a car
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.440]   driving into a French winery.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.640]   A-C-A-R-V-I.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.120]   No, that's not good.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.800]   A-C-A-R-V-I.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   And there--
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.000]   Oh, that's humanity.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840]   And the groan comes from factory Joe, Christmas team himself.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.160]   Hey, Chris, thanks for joining us.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.640]   So great to have you.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.240]   Yeah, welcome.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.640]   We're glad to be back, actually.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.080]   Chris is an open web advocate at Google.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.440]   But for years, he's been taking the lead on open standards
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.560]   across the web, joining Google.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.040]   Wait, you've been out a couple of years at Google, right?
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.920]   No, no, actually.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.160]   It's been just over a year.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.680]   It feels like longer.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.160]   I know.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   I know, right.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.000]   It's the epic struggles that we have faced together.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.560]   But I commend Google for bringing in somebody like you
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.200]   and commend you for going into the lion's den.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.960]   But we're better to go to promote open standards on the web.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.360]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.080]   It took a long hard thought to figure out
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.360]   what I wanted to do next about a year ago.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.440]   And part of it was just having a number of conversations
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.400]   with different folks, thinking about where
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.600]   I could make the most impact.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   And who was actually most seemingly aligned
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.160]   with where I thought the web needed to go,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.280]   especially the social web.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.160]   And so after having those conversations,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   Google seemed like a natural fit.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.480]   I mean, they're obviously a big tech company.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.760]   But they've also been really adamant about ruining open
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   standards and open technologies for quite a while.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.160]   So I'm hoping to do more of that here.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.520]   Did you have to talk them into letting you on the show?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   No, no, actually.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   So far, they've been pretty good about that.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.160]   And PR has been very supportive of what I've done.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.720]   And in fact, the interesting thing for me
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   that I've learned is that in the last year,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.200]   I've kind of gone underground in a lot of ways.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.520]   And that's because I've been doing a lot more
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.680]   evangelism inside of Google, helping Google
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.720]   to sort of understand what's going on outside of the Mountain
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.080]   View campus in terms of the social web
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.720]   and in terms of the different technologies that are out there.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.040]   And they've also been supportive of actually getting
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.960]   more folks in developer relations
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.840]   and throughout the company blogging and using social media.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.440]   So I think that's actually been very positive.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.640]   In fact, it was about a week and a half ago,
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.720]   I was on an internal blogger panel,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.920]   sort of talking about the ways and how to do it
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   and how to make it work.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.480]   And I think stuff like that is very promising.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   That's great.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320]   Chris is one of the--
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.280]   Chris, what's the biggest kind of message
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.720]   that you've wanted to get across at Google
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.200]   or the Google Most Needed?
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.040]   What's the cultural bridge you built?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   I think it's ongoing.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.120]   I think part of it for me is it's not just about technologies
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.480]   all the time, like, of course, out in Silicon Valley
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   and the open sort of standards world.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.040]   We talk a lot about tech and about formats and protocols.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.480]   But at the end of the day, it's really
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.120]   about creating great products and great product experiences.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.320]   So a lot of the conversations that I've been having
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.880]   is like the struggle between, well,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.120]   we want to do the open thing.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.120]   We want to do the right thing.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.240]   We also want to create a great product
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.680]   and a great user experience.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   So how can we achieve both?
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.760]   And I think part of that is understanding what Google
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.400]   wants to do for the web and then how can we
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.280]   work with others to build a better, more interesting ecosystem
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.400]   that enables apps that currently aren't possible
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.960]   because we lack interoperability in those basic underlying
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.280]   technologies.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.440]   Well, as long as we've got Andy here-- and I know Andy's
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   not here forever-- so why don't we--
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.280]   little logistics here.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   We've got, of course, a lot of news to cover.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.240]   But I think it's an opportunity to get Andy on briefly.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.600]   I take it that you've got to go back to tweeting or something.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.520]   Well, I've actually been tweeting this whole time,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.480]   thanks to my phone.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.640]   But I probably don't have to get running it about 15 minutes.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.560]   I've been tweeting the whole time.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.760]   So has it become-- no, but it must have become kind of a--
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.000]   I'm looking at it right now.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.640]   And a lot of what you're doing is retweeting,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.040]   which makes it very easy because you're not
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   to type anything.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.480]   Yeah, most of what I've sent out in the last five, 10 minutes
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.320]   have been retweets from sources that I've
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.760]   found to be reliable in the last couple of months.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.680]   There have been a couple tweets that I chimed in on
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.480]   that I was either skeptical of or wanted more information.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   So it's the kind of thing you can type one hand
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.880]   that can get up pretty quickly.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.200]   But what I've really tried to do is identify who in each country
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.400]   has the right information, who's more reliable.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.440]   And for those that are somewhat questionable,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.640]   how I can involve my Twitter community to vet them.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.240]   So it's a combination of several things going on.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.720]   That's what I was wondering, Andy.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.600]   Do you use any tools to sort of take notes and kind of--
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.400]   an establishing reputation on some of these sources?
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.000]   What are you using to--
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.240]   besides just sort of asking your Twitter followers
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.140]   about determining reputation, what
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.440]   are you using to kind of keep track of who are the people
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.640]   that you feel like you can retweet safely or are
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.040]   like good sources and who you want to stay away from?
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.840]   It's really just virtual shoe leather at this point.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.120]   I typically use Tweet Deck, but there's nothing inherently
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.920]   about Tweet Deck that makes it better than other Twitter
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   clients.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.160]   Essentially, what I do is I always start
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.800]   and try to figure out who I know in any given country.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.600]   Fortunately for both Tunisia and Egypt,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.360]   I had at least half a dozen trusted sources already
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.400]   due to previous travels there.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.720]   And while watching them on Twitter,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.000]   I could, after a while, figure out who they trusted,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.400]   who they retweeted or replied to the longest,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.280]   how long that they had been following each other on Twitter.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.680]   You can tell from the intimacy of some of these conversations
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.560]   how connected they are.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.120]   In some cases, I discovered these folks were brothers
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.600]   and sisters or husband and wives.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.520]   And after a while, you just start noticing these patterns
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200]   in the way people talk to each other.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.600]   It's been a lot harder in places like Libya, of course,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.240]   because very few people are online
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.880]   and everyone's using aliases.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.440]   And frankly, most of my contacts on in Libya
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.520]   have either gone missing and one of them, unfortunately,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.880]   was killed this weekend.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.280]   So it's a lot tougher to vet things there.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.080]   But having said that, the vast majority of the users
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.200]   entering content you see coming out of Libya is real
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.360]   and comes from Libya.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.920]   It's just a matter of figuring out the appropriate contacts,
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.160]   the wins and where and whys.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.200]   Right, right.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.360]   I mean, I think that's a really big question for me,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.400]   something I struggle with in building think up,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.280]   is like figuring out, determining authority and expertise
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   and figuring out those relationships
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.080]   and how people talk to one another
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.200]   and how they're related and what makes them,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.320]   what makes them authorities and what makes them good sources.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.160]   I was interested to know, so it sounds like this is happening.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.720]   You're working your contacts like any journalist would,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.920]   but also sort of using information that you've gleaned
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.240]   just from watching people interact to figure out
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.840]   who's a good source.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.040]   I mean, that's an interesting question.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   Can you automate this or does it just have to be done
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.800]   by a human, you know?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.000]   We've been talking about various ways of automating some of it,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.640]   but I think for it to really work,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.440]   you need to at least know one or two people
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.840]   that you can trust and rely on.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.200]   Once you know a couple of people,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.240]   you can probably run some scripts to get a sense
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.200]   of who they're closest to.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.240]   That's certainly conceivable.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.720]   But like in the case of Libya,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.880]   the reason why I was able to find contacts there
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.080]   was because I first tried identifying contacts
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.560]   in the Libyan expat community here in the US
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.160]   and getting on Skype with them and saying,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.400]   who do you know that's actually there?
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.080]   Which of these Twitter users are real, which ones are fake?
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.480]   And they just talked me through all as many of them as they could
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.840]   and helped connect me to a number of people
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   that have been tremendous sources.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.240]   So there's always actual journalism taking place
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.680]   in the background, even though you won't.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.240]   What you see on Twitter is a culmination
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.600]   of open news gathering and reporting
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   and studs trickle like oral history all happening
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.880]   at the same time.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.040]   It's kind of a bit of a jumbled mess.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.600]   - One reason I'm here is to try to work on this
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.680]   out of CUNY and figure out new ways to develop tools
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.520]   that will help this.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.480]   It's a new form of journalism, you're absolutely right.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.560]   And it breaks out of the idea that we're always
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.280]   just storytellers.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.760]   It's, instead says that the witnesses are doing this
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.480]   and Andy is adding journalistic value throughout.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.640]   One thing is I have this audience here.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.960]   One thing we're gonna try to bring at CUNY
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.160]   is some analysis of Andy's experience on this
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.920]   and I wanna look at the data and analyze and visualize
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.120]   the relationships that have occurred here
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.280]   and see who follows whom and who recreates whom
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.120]   and so on and so forth.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   So there's anybody out there who has a real whiz
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.800]   of this kind of visualization analysis.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.200]   - I wonder if there's Gina Tritani's listening.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   - I was dust.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.080]   (laughing)
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.960]   - 'Cause I'm pretty sure that's exactly what ThinkUp does.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   - Yeah, I mean, this is what we're working towards, right?
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.320]   Is visualizing the relationships and seeing who's who.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.520]   And establishing authority I think is a really big issue.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.560]   And I totally agree, you know,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.640]   someone's just gotta get on the phone
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.760]   and you know, you can't do this with a script.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.800]   I think there's gotta be, so human intervention involved
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.120]   but I think that software, like ThinkUp or I hope
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   that software like ThinkUp can help with that sort of thing.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   - I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.920]   - I mean, I didn't mean to turn this into a commercial.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.240]   I was genuinely interested just from a developer's point of view
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.680]   of like, you know, how we could help someone like you
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.560]   and do what you do because it's so important.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.000]   It makes me feel less bad about following Lady Gaga
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   on the following.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.840]   (laughing)
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.680]   - It makes it okay.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.520]   - Lady Gaga, it makes it okay.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.920]   - It's really keen though, just don't go there.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.680]   - Well, but it can make it, in all seriousness,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.080]   it could be a little disorienting
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   when Lady Gaga's talking to her little monsters
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.520]   and all of a sudden you hear about a big monster in Libya.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's just, it's a little, but that's what Twitter,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.920]   kind of unique to Twitter where
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   they just all jumbled together in interesting ways.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.960]   I don't mind that.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.400]   - Yeah, that's actually one of the things I hear the most
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.840]   from people is that they find it really disconcerting
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.440]   that they're following their favorite fashionistas
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   or whatever and that at the same time seeing me tweet photos
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   of the latest, the batch of corpses coming out
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.520]   of the city in Libya.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.360]   The other thing I get the most are people praying
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.880]   for my safety because every single day people think
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.000]   that I'm somewhere.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   Just earlier today, someone was tweeting me,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.400]   asking me when the hell I'm gonna get out of Benghazi,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.280]   like so many other reporters have.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.160]   I said, well, you know, I wish I could do that,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.640]   but I was sitting on my couch with my cats
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.080]   and my kids at that particular moment
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.000]   and I was in Palm Springs last week.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.800]   So the only thing I had to worry about then was like
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.920]   a sunburn.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.840]   So it can be really strange, but I guess that's also a sign
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.880]   of people thinking what I'm doing is effective
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.600]   if it seems like I'm actually there.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   - Yeah.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.480]   - And Gina seriously, you were my next call.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320]   - Okay, great.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.480]   Yeah, let's do that.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.880]   - Well, I think it's fascinating.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   - Yeah, we'll definitely be in touch.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.960]   - Yeah. - Excellent.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.920]   - And I also enjoy it because it shows that
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.720]   while there's a lot of amusement factor
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.240]   in all of this stuff and there's nothing wrong
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.400]   with amusement, there's also a lot of value.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.320]   It's all mixed together.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.760]   And I guess that was true of television.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.440]   The problem is television was linear.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.360]   This is aggressively nonlinear.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.280]   - I think we talked that you have a couple of Indiana
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.160]   scientists who found that by tracking the words
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.880]   behind six moods and their opposite,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.320]   they could track the up and down in the Dow
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.720]   to like 90% accuracy.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.760]   And there's now a new hedge fund that started out of that.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.200]   And they should learn a different way to do things here.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   - Right, yeah.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.080]   - But I think that this idea that you're capturing
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.960]   the knowledge and psyche and news of the people now,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.320]   that's new.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.880]   And that's what excites me so much
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.560]   about what Andy's doing is that he's adding
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   the journalistic value to that
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.520]   'cause it's too confusing, it's too much.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.120]   But there is, you've got to be open to seeing
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.880]   the value that's there, which is what Andy's done.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.080]   - Yeah, it's definitely what I'm trying to do.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.240]   Because I've heard people say,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.920]   well, it definitely feels like you've got the pulse
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.000]   on your finger on the pulse on what's going on in Libby.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.480]   And I think there's some truth to that,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.840]   except in this particular case,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.080]   the pulse talks back to me,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.520]   the pulse translates for me.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.360]   - Wow.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.200]   - Pulse volunteers to do all sorts of things
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.240]   that there's no way I could do on my own.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.800]   And so, honestly, I don't care if I have 100 followers
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.080]   or 100,000 followers on Twitter,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.600]   as long as the critical mass of them are subject matter
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.320]   experts and people with experience on the ground
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.040]   and people who give a damn about these places,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.600]   because they're the ones that let me do my job well.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.960]   - And the tricks to burn,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   if Leo keeps kids safe, but tell me how the first search is
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.840]   when a big news story happens.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   - Oh, yes.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.000]   So for example, when the US Airways plane
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.600]   went down on the Hudson River,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.880]   the very first thing I did was try to do
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.800]   a proximity search on Manhattan,
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.520]   searching from a timeframe beginning before
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.920]   any of the wire stories went out.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.320]   And searching for phrases like plane, river, holy shit.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.560]   (laughing)
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.400]   And the reason why--
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.080]   - It's really important that you do stuff like that.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.360]   For earthquakes, I search for what the hell was that?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.440]   What the fuck was that?
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.640]   - The search is on Twitter, not on Google.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.480]   You're searching on Twitter.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.600]   - No, on Twitter, on Twitter,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.480]   because people use fleeting expletives on Twitter
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.520]   in the same way they do in real life.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.000]   And so if you can guess how a person's responding
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.480]   to a situation-- - It's interesting.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.400]   - You can often find the eyewitnesses that way.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.920]   - Yeah, 'cause if you're an eyewitness, you say, holy.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.600]   - Holy crap, what was that?
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.120]   Yeah, that's brilliant, wow.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.960]   - You're giving away your secrets.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.840]   - Yep, so now I don't have to do this job anymore
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.680]   because you can all do it in there.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.400]   - I wonder how viable this job is.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.240]   You know, in the New York Times is putting up a paywall.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.320]   When we get an Andy Carvin paywall.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   - You know, how do you make a living doing this?
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.080]   - It wouldn't work.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.000]   You know, even if I could find enough people
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.240]   who wanted to pay it for my Twitter feed,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.880]   the reality is, is my Twitter work is successful
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.840]   because I've got so many people--
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.680]   - It has to be public.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.080]   - I think about following me.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.640]   And so, like I said before,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.200]   I'd rather have almost no one following me
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.360]   as long as the people who are have experiences
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.120]   in the places I'm trying to cover.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.000]   And that's, to me, that's much more valuable
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.160]   because I don't see this as trying to monetize my Twitter account.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.440]   I see this as trying to improve
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.680]   the quality and diversity of NPR's journalism.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.000]   That's my primary goal here.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   - Oh, here, here.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.480]   - Money's not bad, but you know,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.440]   but I think we can make journalism a lot better
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.280]   and make it viable.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.520]   - But kudos to NPR for paying you.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   So there ain't a part of what they pay you to do is this.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.240]   - Yeah, you know, part of my Dave job
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.440]   has always been to experiment with new tools.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.080]   This case has been somewhat strange
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.840]   because as things escalated in Tunisia and then in Egypt,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.600]   I started to ignore meeting requests and canceling meetings
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.760]   and just delegating work to people
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.520]   that I had no responsibility or right to give it to them.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.840]   And as the weeks went by, people started to notice
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.320]   but they were very positive about it.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.960]   In some ways, I'd equate it with the guy
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.360]   in the movie "Office Space" who starts spacing out
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.480]   and goes to work and knocks down his cubicle wall
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.040]   and starts basically doing nothing
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.560]   and gets a promotion for it.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.880]   So I'm kind of like not doing my job in an official capacity
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.360]   but yet all the higher ups here seem very pleased
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.440]   so far on how it's going.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   - But watch out copy machine 'cause--
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.720]   (laughing)
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.560]   - And use that.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.680]   - As much as you can support for piling up on the run.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.880]   - Everybody should follow Andy.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.080]   Do you know of other people like this, Jeff or Andy?
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.200]   Are there other people doing this kind of work?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.080]   I think this is unique.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.320]   - Well, there are certainly some people
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.800]   that are doing a very good job live tweeting the revolutions.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.080]   For example, there's the guy,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.160]   I believe in the UAE named Sultan Al Qasemi
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.640]   who's been tremendous because not only does he keep
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.000]   in touch with everything going on,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.720]   he's a fluent native Arabic speaker
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.320]   so he's got one leg up above me in terms of being able
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.160]   to keep up on tweets that are in Arabic.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.360]   I'm somewhat different in the sense
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.040]   that I have NPR's ability pulpit
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.360]   whereas he's doing this because he just loves doing this.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.280]   And also the fact that I'm able to,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.920]   I really focus on trying to get my followers
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.160]   on Twitter to help me.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.720]   And he does that to a certain extent,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.880]   but it's in some ways the primary way
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.800]   that I'm doing business on Twitter
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.560]   because I would never call myself a mid-east expert
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.600]   by any means, but I feel like that I've got enough followers
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.720]   who are invested both in me and invested in the situation
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.240]   in the Middle East that they're willing to volunteer the time
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.480]   to make my reporting better.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.360]   - Thank you for what you do, Andy.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.200]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.040]   - I appreciate it.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   - And you've got 100 new followers right now.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.200]   (laughing)
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.640]   - I hope you all speak Arabic.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.280]   - Yeah, just remember a car going into a vineyard.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.640]   A-C-A-R-V-I-N on Twitter, follow 'em.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.040]   And thanks to your bosses at NPR for letting you do this.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.160]   And I hope others, I mean, it really is a template
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.080]   for others to do this.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.240]   Of course, if you are in the middle of it,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.880]   if you are, if this is your personal story,
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.160]   you're gonna do this kind of thing.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.560]   But I think it's, I think what we need
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.000]   is more meta-curator, curators at a high level,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.880]   like you are anti-covering more stories.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.400]   And I think it's a really interesting form of journalism.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.480]   - It's a good, you know, if you wouldn't mind,
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.800]   like, I think it's interesting to see what Andy's doing.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.560]   You know, I had the pleasure to meet Andy at South by
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.760]   a rare snippet that I do recall.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   (laughing)
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.960]   - You remember your hat too, so there you go.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   - Well, yeah, so there was something going on there.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.880]   But, you know, it's interesting
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.720]   'cause a friend of mine, Nate Ritter,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.200]   sort of did something very similar,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.480]   though perhaps on a smaller scale in 2007,
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.840]   with the San Diego fires.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.960]   - Right, I remember that was the first time
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.320]   that really broke out on Twitter.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.760]   I do remember that, yep.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.560]   - Yeah, that's so amazing.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.200]   - And both the KPBS were very involved in doing that too.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.160]   That's the local NPR PBS station in San Diego.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.760]   They basically said, we don't know what the hell's going on
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.600]   across the counties.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.720]   We need you on Twitter to help us figure it out.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.040]   And they did an amazing job.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.600]   So, you know, I would never pretend
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.760]   that what I'm doing is new.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.720]   You know, I remember folks doing this
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.560]   when Benazir Bhutto was assassinated several years ago.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.120]   Lots of people did similar things during the 2008 election.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.040]   I think what's different in my case is I've dropped
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.720]   all of my other job responsibilities
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.360]   and I've made this more than a full-time job.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200]   - Way more.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.040]   - Way more.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.880]   - Yeah, I'm doing this six hours a day.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.720]   - It's doing seven hours a day.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.560]   - Yeah, seven days a week.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.960]   And I haven't done in the last five minutes,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.400]   so hopefully they don't think I'm dead
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.160]   or stranded somewhere in Libya.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.000]   - Does that happen?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.360]   Sometimes if you don't tweet in 10 minutes,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.000]   people go, "Andy, are you there?"
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.840]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.680]   I get it all the time.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.080]   And half of the people say,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.120]   "Andy, stop apologizing for going offline."
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.960]   And others say, "Thank you.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.320]   "You weren't run over by a bus."
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   (laughing)
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.000]   - That's good.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   - When Andy, there was a huge night,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.840]   I don't know which one was,
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   it was a huge news night,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.520]   each or something.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.920]   And Andy said, "I'm gonna go to sleep for six hours."
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.040]   And I was in Europe.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.240]   So I saw the moment six hours came later
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.360]   and I just tweeted, "I'm your alarm clock Andy."
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.200]   - Wake up.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.040]   (laughing)
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.080]   - And I got up a little bit after that.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.920]   And next thing you know,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.040]   Mubarak resigned three hours later.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.880]   - That's right.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   - Wow.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.560]   - Thank you for the alarm.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.640]   Actually, we need to write a script
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.440]   so you can DM me and have my phone freak out.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   That would actually be really good.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.360]   (laughing)
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.840]   - All right, Andy, we'll let you go back to work.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.080]   But thank you very much for being here.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.920]   - Thanks Leo.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.760]   - Good seeing you.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   - Take care.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.440]   - Thanks Andy.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.600]   - Andy Carbon, NPR and prolific Twittererer.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   You know what Chris, it strikes me
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.760]   that this is a really good example of how,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.720]   of course you were on Twitter very early,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.200]   how you can design something like Twitter
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.960]   and have no idea how it will be used or what it will be.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.040]   And I think this happens all the time
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   in the net these days, doesn't it?
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.440]   - It seems to be the case of good emerging systems.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.120]   I mean, I think this is the whole premise
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.280]   of working on open formats,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.120]   essentially technologies that allow,
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.960]   well, and I'm diving too deeply into the tech stuff already.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.000]   But-- - Go, go, go, go.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.320]   We want you to do that.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.240]   - I'm just, and I'm sort of making this point
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.960]   because I think Twitter did this in an amazing way
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.800]   very early on.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.080]   In fact, I think Evan Biz have had a knack for doing this.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.600]   If you think about Blogger early on,
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   you know, when Evan Biz were working on that,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.080]   really that was taking sort of a known medium,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   you know, like newspaper articles
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.520]   and moving into a digital domain.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.800]   So you had the titles and you had like this sort of long
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.680]   text body content that you would read.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.040]   And of course, there weren't a lot of people
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.280]   blogging at that time in the mid 2000s.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.240]   And so you could subscribe to people
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.640]   and you could read their entire blog posts.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.880]   As more and more people learned how to use computers
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.480]   and how to type and how to be proficient at it
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.080]   in the subsequent years,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.360]   obviously it became harder and harder,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.200]   at least it was for me,
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   to keep up with all those things going on.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.160]   And meanwhile, people were moving over
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.720]   to their mobile devices for staying in touch
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.160]   and communicating prices started to come down.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.080]   It was more accessible.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.400]   Yeah, yeah, all these things happened.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.600]   And what I think is interesting is that Evan Biz,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.200]   you know, this is my, you know,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.560]   sort of mental model for how this all worked,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.840]   kind of took the model of blogging
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.480]   and they chopped off the body
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.920]   and just took the subjects of the post
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   and allowed you to turn what was previously
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.960]   a private communication channel, namely SMS,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.400]   into a public communication channel.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.960]   And they did that right at the right moment.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.880]   They resisted change for a long time.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.720]   And that simple creation of a new communication channel
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.280]   that was extremely limited and restrictive,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.000]   actually defined a new medium
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.120]   that was so much more accessible to so many more people
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.560]   because as it turns out, it seems,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.000]   most people can string together at least 100 characters
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.320]   and form some sense of a thought.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.840]   Whereas stringing together 100 sentences
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.760]   is not something that all of us can have the ability to do
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.000]   as I'm demonstrating right now.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.320]   So you're giving them a lot of credit
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.680]   for having understood that they were up to something?
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.120]   Whether they understood it or not,
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.280]   I think they knew well enough that, you know,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.200]   these communication mediums take a long time
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.920]   to evolve and to emerge.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.640]   I mean, I mentioned Nate Ritter
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.840]   not because it's like, oh, look,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.040]   he was the first person to do this,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   but because there's a role and several roles
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.520]   that end up being really important
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   in the evolution of social media.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.320]   And so if the software, the technology
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.560]   that you introduce or create is monolithic
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.000]   and doesn't allow for there to be observers
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.640]   and curators and creators and subscribers and favoritors
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.760]   and whatever the different sort of mechanisms are
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.720]   that people use to engage,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.320]   then your medium is very likely to fail
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.680]   or to take an extremely long time to actually take off.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.440]   And so, you know, you mentioned television
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.720]   and you mentioned, well, I guess,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.640]   sort of radio fits into that.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.960]   These are very like one way sort of broadcast mediums
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.320]   are very cheap to sort of like produce
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.840]   once the infrastructure is there,
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.000]   but it's very hard to replicate that infrastructure.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.080]   So on the flip side, blogging is very cheap to reproduce.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.200]   It's very cheap for lots of people
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.240]   to actually participate in,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.640]   whether from a readership perspective
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.800]   or from a publishing perspective.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.400]   And then there are the people, you know,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.960]   which we've seen through Wikipedia
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.280]   that show up and just want to sort of improve things.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.560]   They may not want to sort of be creating their own content
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.040]   or writing their own stuff,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.880]   but they'll notice every typo that you make or, you know.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   >> But we need them too.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.720]   >> Yeah, we need them too.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   >> That's my point.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.600]   So I think what Twitter did was they created
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.640]   these different roles almost accidentally.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.600]   Again, like back when they ritter,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.320]   there was no retweet back then.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.120]   All of us that retweeted would type RT, the username,
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.440]   and then the original post.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.680]   It was all manual.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.760]   And eventually Twitter was like, okay, that's interesting,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.080]   but it kind of like screws up your feed
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.840]   when everyone's writing the same content
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.800]   'cause they're retweeting some of these Whitticism
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.640]   or something like that.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.560]   And so they adopted that and I said, you know what?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.640]   This is a behavior that seems like it could be useful
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.480]   and valuable.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.280]   And so we're going to create a new role,
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.320]   which is the retweeter.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.120]   And there you go.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.760]   >> Yeah, interesting.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.160]   >> But I think one of the keys here,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.120]   this is true of all entrepreneurship,
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.480]   is when you build something and don't know what it is
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.360]   and you are able to hear well enough
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.800]   when your public tells you what it is.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.440]   And that was true of both, for Eve Williams,
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.960]   was true of both Blogger and Twitter.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.360]   You knew there was something there
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.960]   and Lord knows, kept Blogger alive
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.160]   by the dent of his determination.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.320]   But it took a while before you knew,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.240]   oh man, this really is something.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.600]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   Well, I mean, it's true for hashtags too.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.960]   When I put those out there in the beginning,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.680]   I was mostly ridiculed.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.320]   People thought they were kind of stupid
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.400]   and so nerdy that, you know,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.720]   no one would ever use those.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   >> No one would ever use those.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.760]   >> Only Chris Messina would ever want hashtags.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.920]   >> And I kind of believe that
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.120]   and I was like, that seems probably true.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.520]   But I'm going to do it anyways because--
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.160]   >> So you were the first person to do that?
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.840]   >> Wow.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.680]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.520]   >> Well, Chris, I want to ask you--
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.440]   >> By the way, we thank you for the dick bar as well
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.040]   because without hashtags--
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.880]   >> I know.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   (laughing)
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.080]   >> If I were getting paid by Twitter
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.440]   for all the hashtags that they're getting sponsored,
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.880]   then you could thank me for the dick bar.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.640]   (laughing)
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.480]   I can't take credit for that.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.640]   >> But that's interesting because I've heard--
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.000]   >> Because I'm Twitter client too.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   What was the first Twitter client
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.880]   to sort of make a hashtag search,
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   a clickable searchable thing?
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.160]   Do you know?
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.720]   >> Actually, I'm pretty sure it was Tweety.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.200]   >> Which is now the official Twitter client.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.880]   >> Right, right.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.280]   >> And so when I first saw that,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.800]   because, you know, again, like,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.360]   the, both the success and the use
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.040]   and the proliferation of hashtags themselves,
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.480]   first of all, we're never guaranteed.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.240]   Secondly, it seemed completely crazy in outlandish
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.600]   that anybody would really ever support them,
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.160]   even though like, I hope that people would understand
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.640]   that until Twitter supported groups in some capacity,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.520]   we needed some other way to, you know,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.960]   bring ourselves together.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.520]   And once Tweety supported them,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.240]   I started to see other clients do it too.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.080]   And in fact, actually, you know what?
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.040]   Maybe I'm a little mistaken.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.360]   So I think that was the first client,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.000]   but one of the first apps that actually supported hashtags
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.680]   was the search engine that they acquired.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.040]   >> So some eyes, right?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:42.880]   >> Some eyes.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.080]   >> So some eyes saw the value in that,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.520]   'cause they're like, oh, you search for the hashtag,
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   and now you can click it,
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.160]   and that'll actually execute a new search.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.120]   So that, you know, and going all the way back,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.360]   Twitter used to have a feature
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.840]   when you could tweet via chat called track.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.040]   And, you know, Steve Gilmore loves the track.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.880]   But again, it was a--
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.720]   >> I love the track.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.560]   I missed the track.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.400]   >> Right?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   It was like push notification based on that.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.240]   >> Yeah, it was awesome.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.480]   >> That's what it's subscribe to.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.920]   So when you did hashtags, it was a way of sort of saying,
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   hey, I'm interested in this thing.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.160]   So all my friends were stopped by Southwest.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.720]   Let me track that content.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.080]   Then of course, they decommissioned track,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.760]   and replaced it with trending topics.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.360]   And then it became very clear
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.560]   that hashtags would be the way to sort of game that system.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.960]   And so it became the way that people actually
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.120]   formed these ad hoc disposable groups.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.280]   And especially when you're in mobile,
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.600]   especially when you're in SMS,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.920]   you need something that doesn't require any overhead
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.800]   and is extremely, you know, fast and cheap and dirty.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.200]   >> Chris, can I ask your advice on something?
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   I mentioned this on the show where the problem with big news
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.920]   about like the ones Andy covers is the hashtag quickly
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.600]   becomes fairly useless and finding original material.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.040]   And it becomes discussion.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.960]   And then it becomes so gigantic you can't even follow it.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.520]   And I suggested, made a suggestion that Leo brilliantly
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.560]   amended to include another character,
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.640]   let's say an exclamation point at the end of a hashtag
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.920]   to say, I'm actually a witness.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.800]   And yes, it'll get game, it'll be perfect.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.240]   But it's another signal.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.880]   Now, the first question is, does that make any damn sense?
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.080]   For the second question is, if it does,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.440]   how does one start to get people to use it?
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.160]   How does the hashtag spread?
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.800]   >> Yeah, so, and actually I followed up on your blog post,
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.720]   I left a comment sort of describing some of the other
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   proposals that people have had around similar things.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.320]   I think number one, one of the reasons why the hashtag
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.400]   took off is because it was solving, or at the time,
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.080]   it solved the problem at least for me,
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.000]   which was to provide additional context
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.640]   for what I was talking about.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   So if I was at a conference and I said, oh my god,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.080]   that speaker was amazing, my followers would be like,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.400]   what the hell are you talking about?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.080]   And then I'd go back and forth and have to explain it.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.560]   If instead, I was able to say, you know,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.920]   #web2ocon or something like that,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.640]   now you have context for at least knowing sort of
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.080]   where I am, what my context is.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.600]   So that was sort of the generation of that idea.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.280]   As well, it allows people to sort of find each other
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   in sort of a serendipitous way.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.280]   So whether it's through searching or seeing other people
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.840]   using the same hashtag, you can kind of express
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.920]   your affinity for that idea just by using the hashtag
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.360]   in line.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.080]   In terms of introducing new formats or new techniques,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.440]   I think it's absolutely a challenge,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.120]   but of course it's totally possible.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.080]   But I think that the thing that I've discovered
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:26.240]   and that I post on your blog post is that people will engage
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.320]   in activities during emergency scenarios that make sense
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.640]   to their survival.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.760]   And they're not thinking about the journalists,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.200]   they're not thinking about the newspaper,
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.400]   they're not thinking about these other things
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.240]   when they're running around trying to find their family.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.880]   So whatever it is that you want to have as a behavior
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.960]   that gets adopted or widespread, either one needs to be
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.240]   practiced all the time, ducking cover, call 911,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.760]   all those things that need to be sort of grilled
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.160]   into the population because there are things
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.480]   that you do in such a seldom time frame
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   that you never know that you're going to need them,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.600]   let alone should you be paying attention to them.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.680]   On the other hand, if there are activities
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.240]   that you engage in in your day to day life
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   and they just become part of this is what I do.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.920]   Whenever I tweet, I throw in a hashtag
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.560]   or whenever I tweet, I throw in a witness tag
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.760]   or however you want it to be, that could be a way
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.200]   of starting to help spread that information.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.840]   But it's got to start with a couple of people
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.640]   demonstrating that behavior, getting some benefit from it
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.440]   and then allowing other people to emulate that
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.600]   in their own context or circumstances.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.440]   Or else it's just--
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   - And I appreciate that advice.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.800]   - I think it's important, I think you're right.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.040]   I think the main advantage is not getting the journalists.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.520]   If I were in Japan with all this,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.680]   I'd want to know other people who are here
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.720]   so I can ask them, is there any ask station open?
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.240]   That kind of stuff.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   - Yeah, so I think, I really support the goals
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.000]   and the ambitions of what you're describing.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   It just seems like it's a really hard thing
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.960]   to get people to get in the mindset of doing.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.800]   - It is, maybe impossible.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.880]   Yeah, I agree, I agree.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.080]   - Another thing has changed since you added hashtags
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.560]   which was at that time the universe was small
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.080]   and a lot of people probably a large percentage
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.760]   of all tweeters followed you.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.920]   So you had a lot, I mean now I think it'd have to be
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.040]   the company that would introduce anything at this point.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.240]   There's just too many, the universe is too big now.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.120]   - Well, I think that's true but I think at the same time
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.760]   if you started off in these small pools, right?
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.920]   I mean this is kind of where law cats came from
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.080]   and all sorts of internet memes.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.040]   I mean like Charlie Sheen didn't have 2 million
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.240]   or however many millions of followers he had
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.600]   before two weeks ago.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.920]   And so it is possible, obviously if you have your own notoriety
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.000]   you've been in many films with people
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.440]   then you can sort of promote these things.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.960]   But I do think that internet culture has a way
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   of self-propagating if there is a message
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.680]   or if there is a meme or if there is something
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.400]   that resonates.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.680]   So I guess that's the piece of it.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.120]   - It's still possible.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.880]   - It's entirely possible if you hit the right vein.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.240]   - Yeah.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.880]   And if people know how to do that please contact us
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.280]   because there's a lot of money to be made.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.600]   - It's too beautiful to sell.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.760]   - Well if you don't, it's so great having you on Chris
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.200]   and I appreciate it in a great conversation.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.560]   If you don't mind we can take a look at some of the
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.520]   hot news stories that are bubbling up.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.400]   There's quite a bit of news actually.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.640]   I almost don't know where to begin.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.960]   Perhaps we should start, it's not exactly our beat
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.320]   but I think it's an important story with the AT&T buying
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.760]   T-Mobile.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.240]   I'll tell you where it is our beat.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.360]   - It is our beat you bet.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.040]   - 'Cause there's, there's no Nexus S or Google Nexus One
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.200]   without T-Mobile.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.840]   I don't know what they're gonna do now.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.800]   And it gives as the single GSM carrier in the US
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.880]   it gives AT&T extraordinarily clout.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.800]   - This is true.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.080]   Unfortunately I probably can't say too much about that.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.880]   I actually don't do a lot of work on Android.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.480]   Not to mention the carrier stuff is extremely
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.640]   interesting as opposed.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.520]   - Yeah, don't go there.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.760]   - Yeah, I do think that one of the things that I thought
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.920]   was really interesting also that's in the news is actually
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.080]   how all the sprint numbers now are enabled as Google voice
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.000]   numbers.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.880]   So I didn't have anything to do with that.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.040]   But I think it's a pretty awesome feature.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.160]   - So is Sprint gonna use Google Voice as its voicemail
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.040]   system, is that the idea?
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.280]   - You'd have to read into the details specifically
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.960]   but the idea as far as I understand it is that if you are
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.840]   a sprint customer you now get all the great benefits
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.720]   and features of Google Voice.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.920]   - Which is really, it is pretty interesting that they
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   announced that with the 4G Nexus S, right?
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.560]   - They're gonna get the Nexus.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.960]   - The next Nexus.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.000]   - And that, I mean it really isn't an advantage to the
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.440]   carrier at all, right?
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.760]   Because it gives you number portability.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.160]   You can switch phones.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.440]   - But it's all the extras, right?
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.040]   It's all the different features that Sprint doesn't have
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.880]   to build.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.720]   - Right.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.560]   - Where you want to vote.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.880]   - You get visual voicemails for free.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.200]   - Right, right.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.320]   - Well, Sprint trying to position themselves.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.680]   Their outlet campaign is that they're the only ones
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   who mean unlimited.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.880]   And at some point if they're the smallest carrier by far
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.320]   which they'll be, do they become the carrier of choice
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.480]   for geeks who understand this world?
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.400]   They're not there now but these kind of steps give them
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.440]   a credibility that they didn't have before
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.080]   that could be important for folks like us.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.160]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.000]   And I think there's a lot of great stuff happening
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.920]   in the mobile space right now and I'm constantly trying
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.280]   to stay abreast of like everything that's going on.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.320]   This latest thing I think is just very, very interesting
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.760]   to watch and sort of to imagine what it means
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.520]   when your phone and the services that it's tied to
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.800]   provide you with all sorts of great experiences.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.440]   - It was, I mean, that's always the first thing I do
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.400]   with an Android phone as I turn on Google Voice
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.560]   and use that as the messaging system.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.440]   I like doing it better with a pure phone.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.400]   I'm glad to see that the first 4G Nexus
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.640]   will be the Nexus S on Sprint.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   I'm not as excited about it as a CDMA phone
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.840]   'cause it means it's not gonna be a world phone.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.080]   But at least we're gonna get 4G
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.120]   and at least somebody's gonna make
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.880]   and sell a pure Android phone.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.960]   So I'm happy about that.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.680]   Any other thoughts, Jeff, about the AT&T acquisition?
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.560]   $39 billion might take as long as a year to close.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.120]   Of course it's gotta get regulatory approvals.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.200]   So they could all--
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   - Well, it goes back to the Schmidt-Ornette discussion,
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.880]   which by the way is not a joke on Eric Schmidt.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.600]   - No, no, the Internet of Schmidt-Ornette.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.880]   I think that especially with the FCC's proposed rules
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.640]   on net neutrality, it becomes all the more troubling
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.720]   because it's an oligopoly
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.680]   and less competition means more control there
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.160]   and same old boat, same leak.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.960]   - What about those who say including O'Malley
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.600]   who was, I agree with you, very unhappy about this,
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.040]   that it is at least as an opportunity for the FCC
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.000]   to strong-arm some concessions
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.440]   on net neutrality out of AT&T.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.200]   - Let's hope they have the breed most to do so.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.080]   - That's exactly right, yeah, 'cause we haven't seen
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.600]   much evidence of that.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.640]   - I think Kevin Purdy said my favorite thing,
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.000]   which was he's a T-Mobile customer as I am.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.160]   He said, "Oh, this is too bad.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.800]   "I've been enjoying connectivity through obscurity for so--
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.760]   - Yeah, you got the connection through obscurity, baby.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.160]   Tethering free unlimited bandwidth free
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.520]   of very affordable plans, all of that's gone,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.800]   although it is an opportunity.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.040]   And I'm interested to see Sprint immediately jump
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   into the fray.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.000]   It's opportunity for Sprint as now the,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   the really the small guy left.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.560]   And Verizon's already said, "We're not gonna buy Sprint."
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.440]   To say, "Well, okay, we'll take the mantle from T-Mobile
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.920]   "as the alternative carrier."
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   - Well, how do we, is there internet triumphless
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.720]   Twitter revolution guy that I am?
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.440]   Shouldn't we T-Mobile customers,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.000]   and I am one too, with my beloved--
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.240]   - Samsung Galaxy S.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.640]   - Organize and scream and start Facebook groups to say,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.200]   these are the things we demand of UAT&T.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.040]   - Yeah.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.200]   - Well, let's take the bull by the way.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.040]   - I agree.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.600]   - Right to the FCC.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.680]   This thing's gonna take a year to close,
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.840]   right now to the FCC say,
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.680]   "You better make sure that AT&T
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.960]   "gives you some concessions here."
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.520]   And you know, I kind of like that world
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.160]   where you've got Verizon and Google saying,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.720]   "No, no net neutrality on wireless."
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.360]   If there's an alternative,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   this could be a big win for AT&T to say,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.760]   "Well, we'll protect your net neutrality."
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.800]   This is a big opportunity.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.200]   And AT&T is not in, in sense,
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.600]   say to the regulatory issues,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.240]   the press release, you know,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.960]   already started spinning, whoa,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.920]   you know, this is good for rural customers.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.560]   45 million more people get 4G.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.760]   Notice by the way, they didn't mention phone coverage at all.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.120]   I can't remember, I think it was Joshua,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.640]   or Neil Eipatel on Twitch this week said,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.600]   "You know, that press release didn't say anything about phones.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.080]   "It was all about 4G data."
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.040]   You know, nobody cares about the phone anymore.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.640]   It was an article in The New York Times says it
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.160]   in four years, text messages will exceed phone calls
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.240]   as the way people use to communicate with one another.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.840]   It's all about the data, baby.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.000]   Oh.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.840]   Let's see, what else?
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.760]   Android App Store on Amazon.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.840]   - Kind of disappointing.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.920]   - Not very many apps, 3,600 apps.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.280]   Did you want more?
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.960]   - And a crazy roundabout process to install it,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.720]   which is the thing that I really was wondering,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   how are you gonna install it?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.040]   - Yeah, it's not 'cause it's not on the marketplace.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.680]   - It's not gonna come through the Android market, right?
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.360]   So you have to enter your phone number or your email address,
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.320]   and you get a link to,
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.640]   yeah, you click on on your phone,
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.920]   and then you have to uncheck,
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.840]   install, you know, don't install apps from unknown sources.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.920]   I mean, it's quite a thing to get it installed.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.680]   And you know, and you know,
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.640]   there was the promise of free Angry Birds, right?
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.680]   Like that's why you did it.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.480]   Which I got it too, but it doesn't work
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.920]   if you uninstall the App Store, which is interesting.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.320]   And also-- - Why Angry Birds won't work
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.400]   if I install the Amazon App Store?
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.280]   - Right, if you got the Angry Birds Rio
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   from the Amazon App Store,
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.440]   then you uninstall the App Store app.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.600]   Apparently, I haven't tried it,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.400]   but apparently if you try to play,
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.120]   it'll say, hey, it looks like the App Store's uninstalled.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.440]   Please re-install to play.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.120]   - So that's right, I guess all the free apps then,
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.000]   'cause they say they're gonna do a free app every day
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.880]   as the incentive.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.720]   - And my app, I had submitted it, it got approved,
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.000]   and I've since updated it.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.360]   So then last week I submitted my latest version,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.600]   but they never approved it, so they're selling--
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.440]   - An old version.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.720]   - Four versions ago of my app, which is so frustrating.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.320]   - And what happens, so I paid for it on the marketplace,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.400]   is do they have a mechanism for somehow
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.080]   carrying your existing customers over?
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.280]   Or would I have to pay for it again?
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.760]   - I think you'd have to pay for it again through--
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.840]   - Through Amazon. - I mean, you wouldn't,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.880]   because you already have it, but yeah, I think--
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.560]   - Here we go, let me see, 'cause I have it on here.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.920]   You can see to do that text app, which I love.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   I use religiously, let's go to the Amazon App Store.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.440]   The other thing is it's not very pretty.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.200]   I mean, it looks like Amazon.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.480]   - Yeah, and honestly, you don't wanna buy it,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.800]   'cause it's the wrong version.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.160]   - Yeah, right, right, is it gonna overwrite my old version?
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.880]   - Right, will it overwrite the old one?
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.040]   It's a good question, it was the same APK,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.080]   the same, you know, package--
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.400]   - So let's see what's free, although I guess
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.960]   I gotta check every day to see what's free today,
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.440]   World Series of Poker, Texas Hold 'em.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.080]   Well, I'm gonna get that.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.880]   'Cause I got, my problem is I have a Nexus One,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.520]   which has literally no, I mean, not literally,
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.800]   but almost no room for some apps.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.080]   - I know, I'm getting, I'm running up against--
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.800]   - I keep deleting apps 'cause there's no room in here.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.160]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.240]   - But I love this phone.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.160]   I'm not knocking it, but I'll probably get one of them
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.000]   sprint phones.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.920]   So you're on here.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.000]   - Oh, Elleo, you're gonna get every phone alive.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.040]   - I know, this is me, this is me.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:15.960]   By the way, Gina, just so you know--
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.120]   - It seems like Amazon's gonna launch a device, right?
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.680]   Running Android with the market,
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.760]   this seems pretty obvious.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.040]   - Yeah, but Apple says, hey, we own App Store.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.720]   - All right.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.560]   - They're suing.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.960]   Now, we were talking about this on security now earlier,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.800]   and it's fascinating that Steve Gibson was talking to
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.720]   his patent and trademark attorney who said,
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.760]   this is a great story because Apple was turned down initially
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.400]   for the trademark App Store because it was descriptive.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.240]   It wasn't a specific trademark.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.080]   - Ha ha ha.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   - Apple reapplied saying, well, it's descriptive,
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.560]   it's become a trademark now because of us.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.800]   It describes the Apple App Store, so in use,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   it has become a trademark, and they were given the trademark.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.800]   So they do have a trademark, they're defending
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.160]   for the word App Store, but I think Amazon's attorney's
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.680]   probably said, you know, this might be a little bit
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   of a shaky, Apple is actually risking losing this here.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.160]   Interesting.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.520]   Speaking of lawsuits, Microsoft suing Barnes & Noble
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.600]   over Android in the Nook.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.280]   Is this the beginning of a Microsoft campaign against
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.480]   Android, and Microsoft asserts that Android violates its patents?
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.440]   Maybe they go after Barnes & Noble first,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.960]   slowly build up some law, come marching after Google.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.080]   - Android infringes on Microsoft's patents
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.760]   on Microsoft suing Barnes & Noble for the Nook.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.840]   - Yes, you follow that?
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.600]   - And that makes sense because...
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.960]   (laughing)
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.320]   You're following me here.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.480]   - Okay, okay.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.360]   - That's just how it works.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.800]   In fact, it's not unusual to see that where you would go
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.240]   after a licensee first, I don't know, part, you know,
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.760]   sometimes it's to build up a war chest.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.680]   I don't think Microsoft needs a war chest.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.320]   The other reason you might do it is to
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.120]   kind of test the waters here and see what the courts say.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.880]   - Right, right.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.720]   Ugh.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.560]   - What are your friends?
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.240]   I know Chris, when we have a Google employee on
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.160]   Christmas scene, it works for Google.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.520]   He does not speak for Google, I'll give you that disclaimer
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.120]   and you don't work in the Android division,
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.760]   but do you have an opinion on this Microsoft suit?
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.680]   - Given where I'm sitting right now, no.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.520]   - No.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.360]   - No, I don't.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.680]   Nothing to say.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.240]   I will let the attorneys handle it.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.640]   I know, I just had to ask.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.920]   (laughing)
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.360]   You know, I will say something entirely different though
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.960]   about something sort of related,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.120]   which is about the launch of Firefox 4.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.240]   (laughing)
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.720]   - Now we should say Chris was an early evangelist
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   for Firefox.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.560]   - That's right.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.400]   That's right.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.680]   That's how I get my starting open source actually.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.720]   And you know, it is actually somewhat related
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.760]   and I think it's going to be interesting to see what
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   Mozilla and Firefox are able to do with their,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.120]   you know, web app store.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.720]   They've talked a lot about it.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.840]   They, I guess, have some designs and prototypes in mind.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.480]   I'm very curious to see what their user experience will be.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.040]   Since that seems to be something that they're going to need
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.160]   to, you know, up the ante and the next five or six releases
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.000]   that they're doing this year.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.840]   - Well, of course Chrome already has its own web store.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.880]   Oops, that's not a picture of it,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.960]   but that would have been had I pushed the right button.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.840]   Chrome already has its own web store,
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.920]   but they don't call it an app store.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.320]   It's just a web store.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.160]   - Right.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.000]   - Yeah.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.240]   - So avoiding that.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.840]   - What is this sort of different model?
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.960]   I mean, it's similar, you know, a lot of the Chrome apps
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.200]   are all HTML5 apps, which I think is great.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.000]   I'm still waiting for the other shooter to drop
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.840]   with a lot of Apple's apps that may not happen now
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.640]   since they've got such great native support,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   but, you know, I sort of wrote about this a long time ago
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.240]   saying that Steve Jobs hates the app store because, you know,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.080]   - I remember the iPhone.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.920]   - Yeah.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.760]   - Right?
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   The iPhone, so when the iPhone first came out
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.360]   and I've only heard sort of speculation
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.240]   about this after the fact,
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.080]   but when it first came out, of course, there were no apps.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:58.960]   You could install apps.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.440]   It was like lockdown.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.720]   And the best that you could do that was close to an app
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.000]   was you could install a bookmark on your home screen.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.840]   - Web apps.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.200]   - And Steve put a hard sell on for web apps.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.040]   - He did.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.320]   - He did, right?
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.840]   And so for me, this was like, you know,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.040]   as an open web advocate, I'm like, yes, this is amazing.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:14.880]   This is great, right?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.960]   Like finally we're gonna like get a web platform
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.080]   that can compete with native apps.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:20.960]   It can be portable.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.760]   You can, you know, access these apps in your browser.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.600]   Yadda yadda.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.200]   Proprietary.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.000]   - That's right, you know.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.120]   As long as you got a browser, you know, you're in the game.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.280]   And a lot of the Mac developers didn't like that story so much.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.120]   They had their tools.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.440]   They knew how to build stuff.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.160]   And eventually, you know, they came out with,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.480]   well, what turned into, you know, iOS
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.240]   with the ability to build apps, native apps,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.400]   and the whole app store thing to sort of provide them.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.920]   And that had never been done before really in software.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.280]   The fact that there is now, you know,
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.920]   the Mac desktop app store is also
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.160]   this sort of strange fluke in history.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.680]   And it's gonna be very interesting to see
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.600]   if it's possible for others to sort of deal with that.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.200]   So it looks like I'm actually gonna kicked out of this room.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.560]   So I'm gonna have to.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   - Well, thank you, Chris.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.040]   - You didn't sign up for this conference room.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.280]   - No, we'll tell you.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.800]   Real estate is actually at a premium here.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.680]   - All right, Chris has been great having you on Chris's
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.080]   open web advocate for Google.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.280]   And you can find him on the web.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   He's got one of them.me pages now.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:20.960]   It's Chris.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.840]   Chris Messina, who are you using for this?
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.040]   Is it you or?
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   - No, actually it's a verb, v-i-r-b.com.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.280]   Love those guys.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.000]   And they've got this great little like web app builder
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:32.920]   behind the scenes.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.040]   So.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:34.880]   - Verb.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.720]   - Let's start off to try them.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.200]   'Cause I got all the other dot me's.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.000]   I might as well get a verb.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   - Thank you, Chris.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.040]   Next time game us and puts things on the whiteboard
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.480]   that we'll think are great secrets we've seen.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.320]   All right.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.160]   - A blank whiteboard.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.000]   Oh my God.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.840]   What are they planning?
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.280]   They covered up the whiteboard.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.120]   - All right, guys.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.960]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.800]   See you later.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.640]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.800]   - This Messina is always great to talk to Chris.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.160]   He's one of the.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   - They didn't just kick out you.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.160]   They kicked out the whole audience.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.000]   I'm twig.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.840]   - Little do they know.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.760]   There's 50,000 people in this conference room.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.840]   Oh, too late.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.040]   It's probably Chris to Bona did it.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.200]   See, I was supposed to be on this show.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.480]   Chris was supposed to be on this show.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.920]   He gracefully stepped aside for Chris Messina.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.640]   Chris to Bona will be on next week.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.480]   - No, cool.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.680]   - Well, he couldn't get a conference from either.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.360]   Two weeks from now.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.480]   Next week, oh, next week, another Googler, Dan Russell,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.000]   will be joining us.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.560]   What does Dan's do for Google?
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.400]   He's like a search guy, right?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.680]   It's cool.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.520]   - Fabulous.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.360]   - Google search guru.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.640]   Let's take a break since we've lost our panel.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.240]   Half the panel's gone.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.280]   - Was it something I said?
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.520]   - It's your fault, Jeff.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   Let's take a break and regroup.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.960]   What do you say?
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.360]   - Think up, think up, think up.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.200]   Okay, now there was a little subliminal ad,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.520]   but I'll do a real ad right now for fresh books.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.360]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.000]   Yeah, freshbooks.com.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.320]   Fresh books is a great way
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.600]   if you're in a business for yourself,
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.240]   and I know a lot of you are
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.800]   because it's the middle of the day and you're not working.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.240]   So you must be a...
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.720]   (laughing)
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.560]   Right?
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.400]   Right?
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.240]   That's who watches this show.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.080]   - It's true.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.160]   - Yeah, you're a consultant.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.320]   You're billing by the hour,
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.960]   and instead you're watching this week in Google, no.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.600]   - PJ's, your home office.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.960]   - Life is good, isn't it?
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.480]   But there's one little thing in your life that sucks.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.320]   And I know what it is,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.720]   'cause for years I was in the same boat.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.800]   It's printing up those invoices,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.000]   going up, firing up, open office or Microsoft Word,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.240]   and doing an invoice.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.480]   Nothing worse.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.080]   In fact, it's so bad that I would never send invoices.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.520]   I'd get around to it nine months later,
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.600]   and that does not endear you to clients.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.840]   Let me tell you, there's a better way.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.920]   I've found it in 2004, thanks to Amber MacArthur,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.680]   and I encourage you to try it.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.080]   You can actually love invoicing with freshbooks.com.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   It's easy online invoicing.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.480]   Once you upload your logo,
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.680]   you can quickly create an invoice,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.920]   does all the math for you.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   If you do bill by hour, there's an iPhone app,
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.440]   and there's a web app that'll actually
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.920]   let you record your time,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.440]   and then automatically just import it right into the invoice.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.840]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.640]   The invoices are sent by email.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.200]   Now there's a reason why you might wanna do that,
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.960]   but just to reassure you, for a very affordable fee,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.280]   you can also have freshbooks print and mail,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.800]   stamp and mail your invoices,
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.000]   so you don't have to touch it.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.400]   No more licking of envelopes.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.760]   Now the reason I liked the email invoice,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.680]   besides the fact that it really looked good,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.260]   is there's a button on it that says,
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.840]   "Pay this invoice," and I love that,
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.040]   because you can automatically charge
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.280]   your client's credit card, set up auto billing.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.920]   They can pay it from a credit card,
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.840]   or 11 other electronic payment services,
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.960]   including PayPal.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.400]   They don't have to print a check.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.760]   They don't even have to think about it,
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:49.080]   and according to a FreshBooks own customer survey,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.480]   FreshBooks users get paid on an average of two weeks faster.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.320]   Because of this.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.840]   - This may save my marriage, Leo.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.240]   - Do you do invoicing?
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.080]   - Ugh.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.920]   - It's horrible.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.440]   - That's not pretty much my wife, it's awful, I hate it.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.400]   - Horrible.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.240]   Anybody does it.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.800]   Don't Microsoft Excel, or that's crazy.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.480]   I guess you could use Google Docs, but no,
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.280]   this is first of all, it's free for the first three clients.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.880]   For a lot of us, including myself,
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.400]   that's all I ever needed.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.320]   But if you need more, it's still very affordable.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.440]   Do sign up for the three clients to see how it works.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.920]   If they ask you, say you heard it on this week in Google,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.040]   it's all I would ask, so we get a little credit for it.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.280]   And by the way, every day this month,
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.840]   they're having a drawing among their new customers
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.280]   for a birthday cake.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.520]   So even if it's not your birthday,
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.480]   you could get a cake on FreshBooks.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.840]   FreshBooks.com, try it for free right now.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.000]   I think you're gonna like it,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.280]   and you can even give yourself a secure login page
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.120]   with your own name.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.080]   I just loved this.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.640]   I was so happy.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.120]   FreshBooks, in fact, I wanna go back to it.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.600]   Now I pay people to do this.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.120]   And it was easy.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.720]   I'll do my own invoicing, Lisa, it's okay.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.440]   No, no, never again.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.080]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.480]   All right, we have regrouped Gina and Jeff,
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.840]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com,
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.960]   and the author of "What Would Google Do?"
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.120]   I wish Chris were still here
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.640]   because it turns out the young people,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.920]   the young people want to work at the Google.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.200]   A survey by Universome,
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.960]   a consulting firm that helps companies
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.400]   improve their attractiveness
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.120]   to protect prospective employees.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.960]   Apparently that's a business.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.560]   We'll make you more attractive to the kids.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:33.280]   Say that, 25% of their survey respondents said Google
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.080]   is the place they wanted to work.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.040]   More than half the next company down,
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.920]   which was Apple, then Walt Disney,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.480]   then the US Department of State.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.840]   Huh?
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.080]   That was interesting and heartening.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.920]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.040]   They want to take over the world one way or another.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.120]   Government service.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.800]   Right.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.440]   The FBI's on there right after Amazon.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.160]   Microsoft CIA, NASA, and Teach for America.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.000]   So actually, one, two, three, four, five
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.520]   at the top 10 are government jobs.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.360]   That's really--
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.440]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.160]   I love the idealists in Teach for America.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.680]   And they said that the top write-in candidate,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.600]   'cause they were shown given a list of companies,
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.160]   the type write-in candidate was Facebook,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.440]   which isn't surprising, right?
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.240]   You want to work at the places that make the things
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.400]   that you love, and young people love the Facebook, right?
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.520]   So, how do the Google?
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   It's a little weird that they weren't given the Facebook.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.040]   I mean--
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.640]   Yeah, that Facebook didn't appear.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.560]   Whoops.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.320]   Left that one out by accident.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.640]   I'm sure that was an oversight.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.920]   What makes Google so desirable to young people?
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.480]   Is it the free food?
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.600]   The segues in every lobby?
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.640]   It's probably all the press about how great it is
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.400]   to work there.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.440]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.560]   I mean, right?
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.800]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.600]   I helped her.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.040]   That's all Colleen ever wanted to do.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.240]   She even told me when I hired her.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.200]   I know, it's so great.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.320]   I'm not going to stay here.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.320]   Dad said on that.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.440]   Yeah, she said, "I'm not going to stay here.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.080]   I'm going to get a job."
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.520]   As soon as I get a job with Google, it's Sayonara Leo.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.880]   Well, kids, you don't want to work at a big company.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   Work at a small company.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.080]   I agree.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.000]   You start something new.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.720]   You don't want to get sucked in a big corporate machine.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   Make a name for yourself at a small place.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.480]   Whoa, did you--
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:04.960]   That's my advice.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.120]   Did you see that they--
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.040]   Who was it said that Larry Page said
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.600]   that he wants to make it more like it
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.560]   was in the early days of Google?
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.320]   I presume that means more entrepreneurial.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.840]   They've always tried to do that.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.480]   I think--
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.960]   Has any big company really succeeded?
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.040]   Like Microsoft splits up the company
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.400]   into little separate campuses, kind of create that startup
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:25.760]   feel.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   But I don't wonder how much you can get that genuine startup
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.560]   feeling at a big company.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.440]   I don't know.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.320]   When we were there--
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.440]   I think that's why Facebook still--
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.960]   Zuckerberg rags about how small the teams
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.720]   are to build things is that reason, I think, in part.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.880]   He's trying to keep it down inside.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.640]   Oh, I know what it is.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.600]   That was Steven Levy's-- that was an excerpt
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.320]   from his new book about Google.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.440]   That was in Wired, man.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.000]   Because I presume-- I mean, he's got a new book about Google.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:51.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.440]   It's coming out.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.440]   I just got the galley.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.960]   So I'm eager to read it.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.840]   Steven's been working on the Stevie.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.680]   My buddy Stevie.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.160]   He's been working on that for a long time.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.840]   My homeboy.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.960]   Yeah, my homeboy.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.000]   Yeah, hasn't he been embedded in headquarters
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.600]   for like five years?
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.920]   What else came out of there?
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.480]   There's some very interesting stuff in there.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.840]   That's in the current issue of Wired with--
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.440]   Yep.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.600]   --leanware on the cover?
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.960]   Yeah, and I didn't put it in the rundown.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.440]   I should have.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.640]   I apologize.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.400]   Interesting story.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.000]   Theore, more news.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.320]   We got the Georgia Tech story.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.760]   Georgia, is this your number?
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.160]   I don't want to give you your number away.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.400]   No, I don't have a number.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:34.920]   Good.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.240]   Here's a number.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.040]   I won't mention the story, and you now have a number.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.840]   I got to read the story.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.040]   OK, and Joe's.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.560]   Joe's.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.480]   We're giving you an update on the Google Books deal.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.040]   Remember we talked about that a lot last year.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.440]   Yes, Siva, right?
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.560]   Siva, if I did not, was a regular.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.440]   His book is out.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.040]   Speaking of Google Books, his book's out too.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.200]   Googleization of everything?
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.320]   Jeff, you've got some competition out there now.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:57.920]   I know.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.440]   I know.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.720]   So we said this is going to be go back to court,
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.320]   and a battle is going to go on.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   Well, it's back from court.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.560]   The judge is now, according to the New York Times,
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.720]   rejected Google's deal to digitize books.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.360]   Tuesday, a federal judge yesterday,
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.920]   rejected that $125 million settlement
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.400]   that Google had proposed.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.120]   And the publishers had accepted.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.920]   You know, they were going to create a foundation
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.840]   and put a pool of money in it and give it
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.000]   a chance for rights holders to get some money out of it.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.840]   Now that means, I guess, Google Books is back in limbo.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.200]   Yeah, but the judge--
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   did it without prejudice.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.880]   So his basic thing is improve on this in ways
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.720]   that I don't fully know and come back.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.240]   So I think it's a process.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.000]   It's negotiation.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.160]   I guess he's not far wrong.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.480]   He says this deal would--
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.680]   and a lot of people did criticize this deal--
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.360]   would give Google a quote, "defacto monopoly," end quote,
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.560]   and the right to profit from books
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.280]   without permission of the copyright owners.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.400]   A lot of people said, $125 million, come on.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   That's not enough.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.880]   And the judge did say that a universal library
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.800]   would be a great benefit to mankind.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.960]   That's the argument on the other side.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.800]   But he wants a better-- he said-- you're right.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   I think that that's what he's saying.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.920]   He wants a more fair agreement.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.520]   But after all, didn't the publishers and authors agree?
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.680]   Well, that's where we're seeing if we can do a far better job.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.080]   Not entirely.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.280]   I mean, he wants an opt-in versus opt-out.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.600]   I think that's part of the issue here,
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.640]   is that you were presumed to be in the deal
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.080]   and who's to speak for every author.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.560]   So no, I mean, all the authors didn't agree.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.440]   Some, you know, Steve I'm sure wouldn't.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.960]   Though it doesn't really matter, because it's really more
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.040]   about the orphaned authors, which we talked about last year.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.600]   Right, right, right.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.920]   That's what the pool of money, I guess, was to benefit.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.200]   I mean, you know, in the meantime, by the way,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.680]   the book business is changing yet more.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.080]   You've had the borders bankruptcy.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.720]   And now you have HarperCollins,
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.120]   life former publisher, trying to restrict
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.960]   reuse of an electronic book in libraries,
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.080]   which I think is pretty--
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.640]   Yeah, they want a limited number of lending.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.720]   Lend it, Lend's--
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.400]   Come on, come on.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.160]   It's a digital copy.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.600]   It's not even a print copy.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.560]   And nobody's ever done that with print, right?
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.600]   Said, oh, you can only lend that book out 12 times
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.800]   and you got to buy another one?
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.280]   That's crazy talk.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.040]   Exactly.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.800]   You know what?
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.600]   Gutenberg's Bible's been run for 500 years now.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.040]   No, I'm sorry, you can't borrow that.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.320]   Right.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.200]   Too many times it's been out.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.120]   Yep.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:23.400]   Crazy.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:29.440]   So let's-- I have hopes that this might not be dead.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.680]   The judge seemed to, as you say, leave the door open.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.040]   Google said they were clearly disappointed by the result.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.800]   I didn't know this, though.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   They've scanned already 15 million books.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.920]   20% of copyrighted titles have been licensed from publishers.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.480]   And so those 20% are actually there in full.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.840]   The rest--
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.600]   They're just snippets.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.320]   They're snippets.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.600]   The orphan works are snippets.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.680]   And they wanted to put the rest of those orphan works.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.760]   That's the real problem, because those orphan works,
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.400]   in most cases, are orphaned because nobody wants
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.440]   or cares about it.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:01.960]   Right.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.280]   It's so frustrating, though, to think
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.880]   that they have that data and could show it to you.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.360]   But they're just showing snippets,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.160]   because of this kind of legal battle.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.000]   It really would be a benefit.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:10.920]   Valuable.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.840]   And the people were fighting this aren't really publishers
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.280]   and authors.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.120]   Like we said, they made the agreement.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.960]   It's Microsoft and other companies who say, well, no, we
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.400]   want this.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.200]   We want some business.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.680]   It's not people who are looking out for the author's
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.000]   interests, I don't think.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.480]   Right.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.440]   It's Microsoft and Amazon saying that they don't want Google
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   to have control over this and making money from this information.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   How dare Google do this?
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.520]   That's unfortunate.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.440]   I watched last night.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.360]   I watched a great movie.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.760]   Came out a couple of years ago was Oscar nominated
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.520]   called The Last Station about Leo Tolstoy's last year.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.560]   And one of the things his wife was so pissed off at him.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.680]   Because Leo Tolstoy wanted to sign over the rights
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.360]   to all of his books to the Russian people.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.760]   And not charge royalties.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.280]   And his wife said, you know what?
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.080]   No.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.160]   Can't do that.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:02.880]   He did do it.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.640]   He snuck around and did it right before he died.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.560]   She had a fit, at least according to the movie.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.200]   And then anyway, the court reversed it and gave it back
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.800]   to give the family back the rights.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.160]   So this battle has been going on for 150 years.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.040]   Sadly, while War and Peace is in the public domain now,
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.520]   there are no books in the public domain for the last--
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.920]   what is it-- 65, 70 years now.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.680]   How do you like the new chromicon, Gina?
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.880]   Pretty, huh?
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   I don't like it.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.440]   I don't like it either.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.680]   No, I hate it.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   I hate it.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   I hate it.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.520]   It looks like it just got run over by a truck and cut off
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.040]   Latin.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.760]   Like, you know those penny machines where you put the penny
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.120]   in and just smoosh as it?
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.640]   Like, that's kind of what it feels like.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.320]   It flattened it.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.360]   I don't get it.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.400]   I mean, I understand the rationale.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.000]   I like the other one.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   A similar--
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.080]   It looked like a game.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.000]   It looked like something--
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   You know, you've been--
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:00:59.520]   That's the problem.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.760]   It looked like a Simon.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   That might be the problem.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.360]   Right, which I liked a lot.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.120]   A fresh take on an icon, says Google.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.480]   Quote, "A simpler icon embodies the chrome spirit
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.960]   to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.320]   Is it your designer voice, Leo?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.680]   Yes.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.440]   Just an icon.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.760]   I want pink everywhere.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.920]   That is not homophobic.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.640]   That's just designer talk.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.320]   I'm a straight designer that lisps.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:27.920]   No worry.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.320]   I would check you if it was a woman.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.560]   I just don't understand.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.080]   I mean, obviously, this is a designer who said, oh, no,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.840]   3D's out.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   Flat is in.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.520]   Yeah, apparently flat is in.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.080]   It's OK.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080]   I don't think you're alone, Gina.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   I don't think anybody likes this.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   Somebody in our chat room, C. Lindhartson,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.960]   says, I kind of like it a bit.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.120]   I kind of like it a bit.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.960]   I don't know why you change an icon.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.400]   And why you make a big deal of it?
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.480]   And why you publish that?
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.400]   Well, because you know what?
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.480]   They know it would be a big deal.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.800]   By the way, here's a picture.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.520]   Here we are doing it.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.040]   Thanks to TechCrunch.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.640]   Here's a picture of a Simon.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.680]   It does look like that.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.280]   That's exactly what it looks like.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.400]   Maybe that's maybe the-- maybe Mattel said.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.880]   It is a little-- I think it's maybe a little bit old school
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.920]   to have Chrome 3D and have high--
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.800]   specular highlights and stuff like that.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.280]   Oh, no.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.640]   You're giving a little bit of the doubt, Leo.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.680]   Now you're coming over.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.840]   It's three-- it's so 2008.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.200]   I just-- I feel like the new one is just like--
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.960]   it's the Photoshop layer that's missing the other 10.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:40.960]   You know?
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440]   It's just the top layer.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.680]   Just the top layer.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.800]   Chrome 11 is adding-- now, we just got Chrome 10,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.120]   but already they're working on Chrome 11.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   I think this is interesting.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.280]   This is really the first Chrome you can talk to.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:53.760]   It will have--
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.840]   Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.120]   Is speech-- have you tried it?
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.880]   I have tried it.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.920]   So I'm running-- you have to download the beta.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.640]   So I'm running the beta, which I didn't realize
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.720]   was running the beta.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.280]   I just-- I had subscribed to the beta channel a while ago
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.840]   and got 11.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.360]   But if you click on-- there's a link.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.680]   It's that HTML5ROC slideshow.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.960]   There's a speech-to-text page.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.120]   So if you click on that page, you tap on a button,
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.200]   which is the microphone.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   It looks just like Android.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.520]   And you talk into your browser, which
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.600]   is what I was doing earlier.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.080]   And even though I felt silly, I was pretty impressed.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.120]   It does a pretty nice job.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.600]   And it's all HTML5.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.440]   No flash, no craziness.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:27.940]   Wow.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.080]   They haven't yet on the Google page on the search?
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:31.800]   No.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   I don't believe they do.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.080]   Oh, that's what you want.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.880]   And you want the search box to be it, right?
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.380]   Google.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:36.880]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.380]   It should be.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.880]   It should be.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.380]   It should be.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:38.880]   It should be.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.880]   It should be.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.800]   Tell me what I'm doing next, Google.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.600]   And then the Google would talk to you.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.280]   It would be cool if the Google search box detected
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.480]   or the night you had Chrome 11.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.600]   But yeah, it's pretty--
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.320]   Oh, for the letters, you didn't need the address bar.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.440]   Right.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   Right.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.200]   Right.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.840]   Well, I can tell you--
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.360]   Go to Twitter.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.680]   Go to Twitter.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.180]   Right.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.040]   I love on Android, you just press and hold that search button.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.480]   And you say exactly that.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.200]   Twitter.tv.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.280]   And it goes right there.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:06.560]   I think--
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.760]   If you work at home, or is this is great,
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.160]   no one in all offices actually
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.720]   going to talk to their computer unless they've already
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.680]   got the headset on.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.200]   No, no.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.000]   Can you imagine the kick-off any in an open office?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.040]   Everybody's shouting at their computer.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.680]   No, I said alt dot porn.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680]   Not alt dot porn.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680]   Not alt dot porn.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.440]   Did I say that out loud?
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.280]   Firefox 4 is out.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.520]   And so is IE9.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.880]   So the browser wars are back, baby.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.680]   Chrome 10 came out a little ways ago.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.320]   Firefox 4, 4.7-- actually, I should go to the latest,
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.440]   because that's--
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.480]   let me see, that was the first day, 4.7 million, while IE9 only
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.360]   had 2.35 million.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:49.800]   Let me see.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.480]   Where do I find-- let me see if I can find the Firefox current.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.760]   It's glow.mozilla.org.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   Oh, thank you.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.720]   It's G-L-O-W.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.120]   Go to glow.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.760]   Dot mo-- isn't it easier just to type it really seriously?
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   Isn't it?
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.040]   Hello?
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.200]   No, not go-- glow to 10.4 million.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.240]   And look how-- look at that.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.720]   That's cool.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.200]   Pretty cool.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   I like this page.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.040]   What does this even do?
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   What does that do?
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.080]   What does this do?
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.000]   Its lights are going on when people are downloading.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.120]   Ooh, and then there's a little-- what is this at the bottom?
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120]   I don't understand.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.360]   Help me.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.680]   Am I doing something wrong?
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.840]   Uh--
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.040]   Click.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.760]   I guess these are just-- these are downloads kind of going by.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.320]   Is this a lie?
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.560]   It must be a lot of visualization.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.040]   Yeah, and then there's a graph.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.560]   You have a bunch of visualization.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.120]   I don't understand.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.520]   Wow, that's cool, though.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.720]   Even though I have no idea what it is.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.760]   And then there's a Facebook button.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.680]   I can Facebook this.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.960]   I like Mozilla Firefox.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.240]   And a Twitter party.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.040]   Twitter party?
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.040]   Twitter party.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   They're having a party?
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   Apparently.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.400]   Whoa.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.360]   On Twitter?
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.880]   The hashtag is FX4.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.600]   So you have to bring your own hors d'oeuvres?
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.000]   Yes.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.440]   That's no fun.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.880]   Be part of team firefox.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.760]   I've been very good at this.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.000]   I should have asked Chris Messina about this,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.840]   because I think he invented this whole thing.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.920]   Tweet about Firefox 4 with the hashtag #FX4.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.160]   And your avatar will-- oh, I get it.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.040]   These are people's avatars.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.880]   Yeah, roll all that out.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.360]   Got it.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.320]   Oh, golly.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.720]   You could be part of a giant Firefox avatar.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.240]   Wow.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.160]   And he's kind of neat.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:33.800]   Good for them.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.320]   Good for them.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.600]   You're good at viral marketing, yeah?
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.640]   So who uses Firefox still here?
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.160]   No, nobody.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.720]   Have you guys downloaded a 4?
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   Have you tried it out?
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   It's pretty nice.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.200]   I mean, it's much faster.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   That's what they're saying.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.800]   Which is really what they had to do, right?
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   Right.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.880]   Well, it was getting so bogged down by all the extensions.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.960]   So I have a feeling it's faster, because none of the extensions
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   work.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.680]   The extensions are up to date.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.240]   That's amazing, how else it is.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.240]   I know I've got to update my extensions all to do list.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.680]   Happy fifth birthday for Twitter.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   And they have a little video.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.040]   I should find this video to celebrate.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.000]   It's their fifth birthday.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.240]   Oh, by the way, meanwhile, the New York Times is asking Twitter to help it block paywall
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   violators.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.280]   How do you think that paywall is going so far?
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   And so if they started--
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   Well, they're totally in Canada.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   It hasn't started to stress to me.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.680]   Oh, that's the opposite of the real world.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680]   It started to continue.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.280]   Well, wait, why would we be mean to Canadians first?
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.600]   No, no, I mean everybody.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   Let's just get that out of front.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.960]   OK, here's the Twitter celebration.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.840]   It's a Twitter party, five years old.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840]   And they made a video.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.240]   And they put it on YouTube.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.840]   I use Twitter to learn about it and share what they do.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   Richard Branson.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840]   And that's a place.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.840]   Entrepreneur.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.560]   Interested in everything related to this, man.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   Astronaut.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.960]   But also scuba diving, polishing aircraft, anything
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.400]   related products, and photography.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.440]   We're interested in music.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.280]   Vida Bawam.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.880]   Use and funny people.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.360]   Hi, yeah.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.880]   I'd look for paint thinner if I were them.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.760]   That's what I'm finding out with my guest,
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   Rock2Tix.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760]   Yeah, it's Morgan.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   See it in-house.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   This is the sort of a monster.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   This is exactly what I do.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.080]   I follow Green Bay on Twitter.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.040]   Oh, Serena.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.920]   I always like to keep up with what they're doing.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.120]   They're my favorite band.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.400]   I want to stay up to date on fashion news.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.000]   So I follow--
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.360]   RZ Rachel Zoë.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.880]   I'll go on the show for a daily fashion.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.080]   I follow my old world.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.280]   Snoop's doing.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.160]   Because Martha Stewart keeps me scutted in buddy.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   Baked in fleckers.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.760]   I love to wake you back with the kids.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.280]   Yeah, baby!
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.120]   All right.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.800]   That's a way to get lost to know what people want.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.000]   And I use--
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Julian Paretta.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.640]   And as that knows, it's a way of learning what I should do.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   And I should do.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.800]   And I'm going to do a better fashion.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.080]   I can talk to the fans.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.760]   They can talk about the new fights they want to see.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.960]   Things I'm doing wrong.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.520]   Ultimate Fighting, Dana.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.680]   Whatever the field might be.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680]   Love Dana.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.240]   Are you a fan of USC?
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   I am.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   Wow, Dana.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240]   I think you can tab his with all of us.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.240]   Dana never would have known.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.480]   Dana's using aquariums.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:16.840]   Really?
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.080]   I wouldn't think UFC.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.480]   Full of surprises, Argy.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.800]   So this is pretty good.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.640]   This is well done.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.840]   Out of the back to the astronaut.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.960]   What's the thin diagram, pardon me, of Glee and Ultimate
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.520]   Fighting?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.440]   Do you watch one right after the other?
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.880]   We've had this conversation, Glee, and Ultimate Fighter
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.520]   Gay.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.840]   That's the two.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.880]   Ultimate UFC?
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880]   Oh, really?
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880]   Yeah, a little bit.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880]   A little bit, you know?
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   Oh, wow.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880]   No, I like UFC.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   I--
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   You've rocked my world, Gina.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   I--
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   I have no idea.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   I have--
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.960]   No, I've watched UFC.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   My son likes UFC.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.440]   Wait until I tell him it's gay.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440]   He's going to really enjoy it.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.920]   Oh, I'm going to get email about this.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.760]   I've already gotten email about this.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.640]   I'm going to get more about it today.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   I can tell.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.720]   No, but this is the beauty of this.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.880]   This is the beauty of this.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.920]   It's just-- it's just another thing.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.560]   It's like somebody has five fingers.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560]   It's just another thing.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   Exactly.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.960]   It's not-- it no longer means it's just a thing.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.120]   New York Times Paywall limit to extend beyond Google to all major search engines.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   Now this is different from what I thought.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.560]   So let's talk about the New York Times Paywall.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:29.520]   They are going-- now with the Wall Street Journal, Google link on Google News was to
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.920]   the full article, which I always thought was a great loophole.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   Right.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   They're not going to do that?
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.480]   They're going to allow in social links and you can go to the fronts of all the sections.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.320]   And so you can go through RSS and such.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:48.440]   But when you hit 20 stories, 40 things a month, it's going to put up a month.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.440]   A month.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.440]   OK.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.120]   That's considered a frequent user, which I think is a rather sad commentary on the
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   nuclear resistance.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.520]   Yeah, because I mean, that's less than an article a day.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   That's Monday through Friday.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.000]   I mean, I read them far more than that.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   I guess we all are more.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   Right.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.640]   So that's a frequent user.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.320]   And then they're going to say pay up.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.560]   And they're going to the frequent users in the hopes that they keep on saying most people
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   will not hit it.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560]   Well, OK.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.160]   Except that means most people are even less engaged with the New York Times.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   So that's--
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160]   That's not good.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]   --odd.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.000]   And then when you try to make people more engaged in the New York Times, your reward for that
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   is paying--
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   Pay up.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   --break.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.480]   You know, I think that they might pull it off because they are the New York Times.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   People care about it.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   It's the best in the country.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Yada yada.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.920]   Well, Chris started the yada yada, didn't he?
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920]   But--
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.920]   That's so Seinfeld.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   It is.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:44.200]   By the way, friends started a-- somebody I know started a if Seinfeld had Twitter hashtag.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.160]   Oh, that's good.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.440]   And my contribution was I just took control of a mile of the information superhighway,
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.040]   said Kramer, if you know that episode.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   Yes.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   Never mind.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   Anyway, so--
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   --so laughing inside.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   --I know.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   It doesn't go anywhere.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   Well, you can't repeat a tweet.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.000]   The danger to the industry, I think, is the Cleveland Plain Dealer or the Dayton Daily
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.480]   Disgrace will think, oh, if they can do it, so could we.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   And they can't.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480]   Right.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   Right.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   So the policy of-- you get-- so search engines get five free clicks a day.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   Right.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.000]   So for the first five articles, you get through news.google.com.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.680]   No.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   Not Google.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   No.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680]   It's really confusing.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   May 20 years.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   Much more.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   They're taking advantage of-- no, you're right.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.160]   They're taking advantage of the Google Freebie and stuff.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.480]   And so that is, you're right.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   It's set at five.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.840]   It's set at 20 a month.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.640]   Social links usually work.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   But it's complex.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.440]   And then you can buy-- if you buy the paper in print, then you get all the online stuff
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.560]   for free, but I think not the iPad app.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.520]   The iPad app is extra.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.760]   If you buy the weekend or plan, you get online for free.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:13.880]   If you buy online only, you get phone apps and web, but iPad is extra.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.640]   Now incidentally, we talked about this in security now.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   It is about the flimsiest paywall you could imagine.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.200]   It's some JavaScript code.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   And if you turn on no script, you go right through it.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.200]   Right.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.160]   And so there have already been scripts that-- actually, all it is is a little bit of-- a
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:36.520]   few divs that put something up on top of the page and disable scrolling.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.600]   And if you take those divs out, well, I think it's already an application to do that.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.000]   You know, part of this is if you want to go to this much trouble, you like the times
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   of that much.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.880]   The argument, the moral argument is then pay for it.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   That's the deal now.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.200]   It's the price.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.120]   The other argument is that if you go to this much trouble, they're still getting page views
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   and they're getting advertising revenue.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   And that's fine.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.840]   They're just trying to find a new revenue stream.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   You know--
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   Which I admire.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   I love the new times.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.480]   I want to support them.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   I agree with that.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.240]   One of the great things in the story is that there's some woman in Canada who tried to
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.360]   send them checks all the time saying, I should pay for this.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.880]   And they had to send it back.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.120]   The question really is the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the-- the
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.640]   Cuy Van, who is the former digital design director, who's a really talented guy at the
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.440]   times, he was down at South West.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.320]   He wrote a very good post talking about this as an opportunity cost.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.120]   And the time has spent a year and a half.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.120]   Right.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.200]   Uh-- missed revenue.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.800]   Well not just that $30 million in terms of missed opportunities to innovate and do new
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.320]   things, different things.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.280]   How could you invest that money in other things?
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:47.320]   The time started out of their lab, news.me, which is now being run by Bitly and beta works.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.840]   And that's the kind of thing that might, you know, be better for them.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.560]   Similarly, Murdoch spent $30 million starting the daily, which was just a copy of the old
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   model.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   That's somewhat disturbing.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.040]   Cuy said it was part of the reason he left the Times, because he's an innovator and
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.200]   they, you know, they were cost-free and all this time on just the paywall.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   I'm rooting for the Times to succeed.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   We need the Times.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.200]   I like the Times.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   I love the Times.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   I read the Times.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.720]   Um, I just don't know if this was the best way to go.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.920]   They, uh, they say they rolled it out in Canada first.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.200]   It's coming out to the rest of the world of 25 days, but they rolled it out to Canada
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.960]   first to get rid of the bugs.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.560]   And that's good because a Canadian hacker immediately created a bookmarklet that you
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.160]   could just drag to your tool bar that just, uh, turns it off.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160]   Goes right through it.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.360]   So that's, uh, that's probably the easiest way.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.160]   Just, just drag this to your toolbar and you'll get the New York Times without that
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.160]   civil.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   I just pay for it.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.160]   Pay for it.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   Let's pay for it.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.760]   The Times is worth it as opposed to the daily.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.760]   Right.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.760]   I know a lot of people who are saying, you know, what it's forcing me to do though, it
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.800]   was kind of audit my Times expense.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.440]   And, you know, my wife has said this and somebody I, I had a news executive I was just with
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.720]   today earlier said, you know, do I really want to pay all this for the print and I really
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.960]   never really look at the print.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.760]   So maybe it's time to cancel the print and go online only.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.600]   And that hurts the Times more because the print reader is still more valuable.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.840]   Thanks to stupid advertisers.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:16.400]   The Times has also asked the folks at Twitter to turn off, uh, aggregators like, uh, free
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.240]   and NY Times, which aggregates New York Times stories puts the links in.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:30.800]   My presume puts the, uh, paywall free links in, um, so this guy's getting out of the
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800]   New York Times.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.920]   That's actually no, it's still, it does appear to be still getting updated.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   Okay.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920]   Paywall.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.280]   This is why I don't like paywalls.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.680]   Uh, I understand that people want to make money.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.960]   I certainly support that.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.640]   We try to make money.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.200]   Uh, you know, you took cost money to create content and New York Times has awesome content.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.240]   And a huge staff and spends a lot of money to create that content.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.280]   So they deserve to get paid, but it becomes whack a mole as soon as you put up artificial
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.120]   technological restraints.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.800]   Um, geeks just going, yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.560]   Let's see how we can get around that.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.480]   And we've already, there's a dozen ways to get around it already.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.840]   And so what is the New York Times do that?
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.680]   They're going to do, I'll tell you the opportunity costs.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.440]   Now they got to spend money and time fighting against these, uh, workarounds.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.920]   And there's an unknown cost to market this and to convince people to do this and to deal
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.720]   with the churn and people who leave.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.880]   They did a hell of a lot of research.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.200]   I know a lot of people who got surveys were you be willing to pay this?
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.000]   Were you willing to pay that?
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.080]   And they opted for a pretty expensive.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.480]   It's not, it's not cheap.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.520]   They say that's what the market says they'll pay.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.960]   So there is a problem there as people say, Oh yeah, sure.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.280]   I'll pay that.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.840]   And when it comes time to take the money out of their wallet, will they really?
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.240]   Well, they'll find out soon enough.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.920]   I think we should pay in Bitcoin.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.920]   Yes.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.800]   What a smooth transition.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.760]   That's why we are up for a row.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.520]   Google, we've talked about Bitcoin on security now quite a bit.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.880]   In fact, there was a whole episode on Bitcoin.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.960]   The idea is I'm not completely clear.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.400]   It's a new form of currency.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.560]   You earn bitcoins by solving problems.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   In other words, dedicating computer cycles to the Bitcoin engine.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.320]   There is a market in cash for Bitcoin.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.440]   Yeah, actually greenbacks, hard American currency.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.560]   There is some thinking that that's actually just a money laundering effort.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.560]   I'm not sure exactly how that works.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.400]   But Google's now announced an open source Bitcoin client.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.040]   Do you think Google wants to have its own currency?
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.040]   Facebook does.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.000]   I'm pretty sure I had a drunken conversation with someone about this to sell it myself
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   last.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   And it's all coming back.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   It sounds like the kind of thing you'd have in a drunken conversation.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.400]   It's just as strange as so actually it's probably a 20% project or maybe it's not even
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.160]   official Google.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.200]   It is in the Google code, Apache 2 license.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.560]   It's a Java client for Bitcoin.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.160]   They call it Bitcoin J.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.920]   It's not an official Google project.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.560]   It is a 20% project.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.560]   By the way, Google says they're going to donate 20% time to Japan, which I think is really
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.560]   great.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560]   Google engineers in Japan.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560]   That is great.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560]   What does that mean?
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560]   What does that mean?
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.560]   What are they going to?
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560]   They're going to Google all out.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.840]   They're going to be the engineers who are currently doing 20% projects to devote those
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.520]   hours to helping Japan, whether it's volunteer work or...
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.160]   Awesome.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.080]   So did you know that...
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.320]   I wish I don't maybe be a smartass mother's.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   I really mean it.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.440]   I wish they could put the smarts of Google around finding solutions for the damned reactor.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.440]   Yes.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.280]   Well, maybe that's one of the things they'll do.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.280]   Maybe.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.080]   Maybe a stranger things could happen, folks.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080]   Not stranger than this.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.920]   Lady Gaga and Marissa Meyer.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.440]   It's a great video.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   I don't...
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440]   Who is Lady Gaga?
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   Says the Google search.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   This is pretty good.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:20:01.440]   For those of you listening, they're getting a dancing search query.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:06.320]   A billion views of Gaga on YouTube.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.320]   That's actually an old number.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.120]   I think it's far higher than that.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.120]   Oh, it keeps going.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   Oh, wait.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.120]   8 million followers on Twitter.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   Kids lip syncing.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   Do you Google the lyrics?
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:47.480]   To bad romance.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.120]   Is this done by Google?
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.120]   Yes.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.120]   Wow.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.920]   Yeah, this was their intro video to the interview.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.680]   So Lady Gaga was at the Googleplex and was interviewed by Marissa Meyer, who was a fashion
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   fan.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.680]   Great, caring.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680]   What a great error.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   No kidding.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   How was the interview?
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   I didn't see it.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   I only got to watch the first few minutes.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.720]   I thought it was really cool that Marissa seemed pretty nervous.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.800]   But Gaga was very comfortable and seemed to...
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.720]   She mentioned it right away that all of her friends in high school wanted to work at Google
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.920]   and she sort of acknowledged there were some great minds in the room.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.520]   She said she didn't want to work at Google.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.840]   She wanted to be the person at the top of the search results always, which she obviously
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.840]   has done.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.840]   She's got it.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.840]   But it's a good interview.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.840]   I plan to...
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.840]   I'm going to watch it later on the full video.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:36.040]   It was neat to see the two of them on stage.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   Great reception there.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040]   That's really neat.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040]   Everybody loves Gaga.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.040]   It doesn't look.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   I confess.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.040]   I just downloaded...
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.880]   What do you do when it's audio?
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   It's not downloading.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.080]   I added Gaga to my collection.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080]   Nice.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080]   It's okay.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.080]   All right.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.880]   I'm just joking, of course.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.360]   You're a loud Leo.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   I love you.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   You are loud.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.000]   I'm just joking.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.160]   Being a gay, I can transfer that power on to you.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160]   You're a loud.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160]   Thank you.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   Okay.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   Back now, you say I'm gay.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160]   I am so happy.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   You're in.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   I'm in.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.800]   I say you can be old.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.440]   No, that's too late.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.240]   It's already happened, sad to say.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   All right.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.240]   We're going to come back.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]   I'm going to watch that video.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.240]   I want to see that video now.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   That really is very interesting.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   She tweeted her favorite moment from it.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   I forget where it was.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.240]   Merced it?
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.240]   Hold on.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.400]   It's obviously something just...
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.720]   Merissa just wanted to do.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   Right?
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720]   It's...
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.120]   My favorite moment of Lady Gaga talked 35-minute mark.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.120]   Best piece of advice.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.720]   If you don't have any shadows, you weren't standing in the light.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Wow.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.720]   That's heavy.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   Heavy.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.720]   Let me think about that for...
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720]   Yeah, I brought the showdown.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   Sorry about that.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720]   There we go.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720]   Perfusion.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720]   Wow.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720]   You're not...
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   How far into the...
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   35 minutes.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   35-minute mark.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720]   Okay.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.720]   You watch.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.520]   I'll do an ad and we'll come back.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.520]   This...
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.840]   Then we're going to get our tool tip and number of the week.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.320]   Jeff, you can look.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320]   I left one.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   I left one for you.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320]   I think this is a gift.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.440]   Time to mention our friends at Citrix.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.880]   I'll give you a number.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.160]   How much do you think it costs on the average business trip?
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.400]   According to American Express, $1,000.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.480]   Many of us work with people around the country, around the world.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.040]   Those traveling expenses, not only expensive, it's time consuming.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   It's just...
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.080]   Nobody wants to do it.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.320]   That's why I recommend and use Go to Meeting.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   We've got to go to Meeting coming up right after the show with one of our suppliers.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   It's just...
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.800]   It's so wonderful to be able to meet with clients and colleagues on the Internet and
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   go to Meeting.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   It makes it so easy.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.360]   You can try it right now for free for 30 days.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.320]   Go to go to Meeting.com/twig.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.000]   G-O-T-O Meeting.com/twig.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.040]   30 days free.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.880]   It'll give you an idea of what you can do with it.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:05.920]   Now, one of the things I really like about Go to Meeting is that your clients, your colleagues,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.000]   don't have to jump through hoops to have a meeting with you.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.600]   You install it on your system.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.920]   It'll integrate with your email program.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.160]   You send out an invitation.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.840]   All of a sudden, they've got the invitation.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840]   They know what time.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.360]   It includes teleconferencing, VoIP or regular phone.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.000]   They've got a great iPad app, so they can even meet with you on an iPad, which is fantastic.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.400]   30 seconds, they'll install the software, even if they don't have it already.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.560]   Then you're ready to meet.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.720]   I just use it for all at voice conferences, because if I want to fire up a screenshot,
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.800]   I can or they can show me something.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.200]   Goes both ways.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.960]   Go to Meeting.com/twig.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.160]   I've been using it for years.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.600]   I want you to try it now free for the next 30 days.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.160]   I think you'll like it.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   G-O-T-O Meeting.com/twig.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.360]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.520]   Quick tip this week.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.640]   Google Search, getting a little smarter, making educated guesses about what the release date
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.480]   is for movies and video games.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.000]   If you Google Sucker Punch, release date, it'll say at the top of the results, "Best guest
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.880]   for Sucker Punch, release date is March 25th," which is later on this week, and it will
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880]   cite what the sources are.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.560]   It seems to only work for movies and video games, but it'd be interesting to see this
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.760]   kind of thing work for things like TV shows and other things as well.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.280]   That's really neat.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:27.400]   Again, trying to give you the information you're actually looking for.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.840]   Without making you travel off to another site.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.680]   Great clever.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.840]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.720]   Thanks to you, Leo.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.920]   We can do Georgia Tech gets $1 million to build a benchmark for the open internet to
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.360]   see how open it really is.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.400]   All the more interesting, since the Google Verizon deal, does the internet include the
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.760]   wired internet or does it include the mobile internet?
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.200]   What's really neutral?
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.360]   I think having a benchmark to decide that is good.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:58.800]   The other thing I would like to put in a pitch for is I want to have a definition of high
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.960]   speed for hotel rooms so we can go hit them over their head with our machines when they
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.360]   do not work high speed and what definition.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.200]   I want a benchmark for that.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.360]   Well I have to say, we need benchmarks or definitions for a lot of things, including
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.120]   what the hell is 4G?
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   Yes.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.720]   What is broadband?
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.280]   I can think of a lot of things we don't have any definitions for actually.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.760]   I'll give you one more number two since the honor of Andy and thank you for having Andy
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   on.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.760]   He's great.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   He's great with his magnificent.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.840]   Most tweets he's done in one day, again most of us retweet, but he's done 1,300.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   Oh man.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   Whoa.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.640]   That is a full time job.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640]   Wow.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.680]   My tool of the week is a much improved Google latitude for iOS.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.120]   They've been updating all the Google tools.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.280]   I mentioned Google search last week, I was showing the old version, it turned out, but
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.000]   you get the idea.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   The new Google latitude actually has parity with latitude on Android.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.080]   Latitude has just been lagging for a long time.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:09.360]   Latitude is Google's check in service, kind of their version of 4 square.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.920]   But it has some interesting features, one of which is automatic login.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.320]   I use 4 square all the time.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:21.160]   One of the problems with 4 square is that you have to manually tell it to log in.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.440]   You can say if you're at a spot that you want to have automatic check-ins, here I am
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.440]   a twit, I could say post it publicly, post it with friends, check in here.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   And then can I also say, oh I have to accept this, I can also say from now on when I get
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.800]   to this place, just check me in automatically, which is kind of interesting.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:47.760]   So they've beefed this up and I have to wonder if this is the beginning of, see I'm a regular
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.120]   by the way, am I a place of employee, I have to sign up and I go, okay.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.240]   But this is really interesting, I can see my other latitude friends, I can see where
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.240]   they are.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.040]   If I zoom out, I can see where they are all over the world.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.520]   I liked this so much and I thought it was so useful, I deleted a lot of people because
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.200]   I was just saying yes to everybody.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.440]   So now actually these are actually people I know.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.360]   I get the check-ins and I get the three closest check-ins.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.560]   This is very much like the Android version, but it's now an iOS.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:22.160]   Do you think I wonder if this is going to become, I by the way invited you and Jeff
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.280]   and Gina to be my friends but you haven't said yes yet.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.120]   But I just wonder if they're really kind of eyeing what's happening with 4-square and
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.840]   saying gosh, we're missing the boat on this.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.680]   Maybe we should, maybe we should now, unlike a lot of the check-in services, it doesn't
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.000]   cross check you in at 4-square.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.680]   I still think 4-square as a success is still small.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680]   It's growing.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.200]   So there's an opportunity here.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.200]   I do think so.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.440]   They're about to raise another round I saw somewhere online.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.400]   Yeah, they've got what 4 million new users last year, so they're growing and they've certainly
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.400]   changed a lot.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.760]   I think this is really, by the way, this integrates right into places.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.560]   That's what you're seeing here is the places entry for Twit.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.720]   The value to Google is more signals, right?
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.280]   I've argued this in the show before that the best signal generator from us that can then
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.120]   target as in a content is the winner.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.280]   So how can Google really push us to tell them where we are?
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.640]   Well, carrying the phone is the best indication of all.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.880]   Turn this on and you, yeah, I think this is really, really interesting.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.680]   It's actually quite useful too.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.760]   And I kind of like the auto login feature but that's why I eliminated all the people
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.360]   who I didn't know because I didn't want to automatically tell them where my house is
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.360]   and things like that.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   Come visit.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360]   I'm home.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.360]   Right.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   Or worse.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.360]   Or not home.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.360]   Come visit.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.360]   I'm not home.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   It's even worse, isn't it?
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.680]   So if you have iOS, I've been using latitude for a long time and I kind of polished it up
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.760]   a little bit because I've got it now on Android and iOS.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.560]   And I think it's an interesting alternative to say four square or go while on one of the
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.160]   other checking systems.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:04.040]   Gina Trapani is a blogger at our wonderful smarter where.org.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.440]   You must read this site regularly if you do not.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.440]   You're missing out.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.000]   I'm sincere on that.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.440]   She also has a great app called Think Up, used by movie stars and normal people everywhere.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.960]   And by the White House.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   So that's pretty good.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.960]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   All you need is Lady Gaga to use it.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   Oh, that's what I need seriously.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   I can.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.440]   But Leo could hook that up.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   I'll work that out.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.440]   Leo could work that out.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.440]   Leo's my connection.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.440]   Well, you know, we go way back.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.240]   Let's get Lady Gaga on here.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.360]   Or Marissa Mayer, one or the other.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.360]   Marissa would be good.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.080]   I'd be much more interested in Lady Gaga.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.040]   I have yet to see Marissa.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.080]   She's two poised.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.440]   I've yet to see her slip and say she's not the Eric Schmidt.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:55.280]   You need to watch this interview with Gaga because she was giggly and like, I mean, really
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.680]   like you could just use nervous and into it.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.680]   It's good.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.320]   35 in, huh?
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.320]   What happens?
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.320]   That's the line.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.560]   That's her favorite kind of line advice.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:09.800]   Even just the introductions, you can tell she's really excited.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.400]   Well, my first question that I wanted to ask was, how are you?
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   I've got two Gaga's going.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   Oh my God, it's terrifying.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.680]   I was never really asked you and I've rented it.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   Where's that coming from?
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.560]   So I wanted to ask.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.280]   There's too much Gaga.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   All right.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:31.280]   I'll find that 35 minutes in.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.280]   We'll play it maybe next time.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.280]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.280]   Jeff is at Buzzmachine.com and his book is What Would Google Do?
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   And we will talk to you next week.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   We do the show live every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.280]   Highlight of our week.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
