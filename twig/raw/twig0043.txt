[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.440]   to show the covers Google and the cloudiverse.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.800]   Is that a word?
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.880]   It is now.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.720]   I just made up a new word.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.920]   That's Jeff Jarvis there.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.920]   He's back in his office in New York City
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.800]   at the City University of New York.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   I'm home today, actually.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   Oh, you're home, all right.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.080]   Great.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   And that's right, you are home.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.960]   You were just in Ottawa this morning.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   Yes.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.280]   Have a nice visit.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   It's always pleasant.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.960]   I love Canadians.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.480]   Were you speaking up there?
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.360]   Yeah, I spoke about the future of Canadian media.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760]   Do you-- that's interesting, as opposed to other media.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760]   Actually, they're in better shape than America.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.360]   That's a whole other podcast.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.280]   Canadians are literate.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.880]   They are.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.600]   Yeah, they're you.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.080]   And nice.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.760]   And nice.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.800]   Oh, they're so nice.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.240]   Nice.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040]   That's always-- you know, the story is you bump into a Canadian
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.480]   he apologizes.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.000]   They joke on Twitter today, right?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.840]   Why doesn't it mean about this?
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120]   And somebody said, the way you got a new Canadian
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.800]   to apologize is by stepping on his foot.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.400]   Also here from Moscow-- well, San Francisco,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.320]   just down the road apiece from Moscone Center.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.520]   She's actually in the Pixelcore offices today.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   The author of the Complete Guide to Google Wave,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.120]   Gina Trapani.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.960]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   It's great.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.440]   You were at the keynote today.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.160]   I was.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.680]   I was.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.040]   I was in a nerd-filled room.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.800]   It was very exciting.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   Good.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.520]   We'll talk.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.280]   Bowers.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   We have much to talk about.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   Many hours.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.560]   It seemed to go on a long time.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.440]   It did go on a bit.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.200]   Also here to comment on Google I/O, Kevin Marks,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.640]   who's in his office at British Telecom at BT.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.320]   He's part of ribbit.com.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.600]   And a great commentator, man, has been at Google.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.040]   Was a social-- were you an evangelist?
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   Social--
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   Advocate.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.680]   Advocate.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.880]   There's a better word.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.840]   That it was.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.480]   Where's the hierarchy there?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.640]   Well, the advocate is two-way.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   Evangelism is one-way.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   There you go.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.280]   Oh, I like it.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.360]   I like it.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.920]   Kevin is the proto-podcast.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.520]   Yeah, he was the first to show the use of a pod--
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   iPod with podcasts when he was working at Apple,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.320]   worked on QuickTime and iChat.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.200]   It's so great to have you all here to talk about Google I/O.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.920]   So what was this?
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.960]   Since you were in the audience, Gina,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.680]   give us a little paint picture of what
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.360]   it was like this morning at the--
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.440]   first of all, I have to say, this keynote
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.480]   is not the only keynote, is it?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.040]   No, it isn't.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.360]   There's one tomorrow morning as well at 8.30 AM.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.960]   I don't know what they were thinking about that.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   Somebody said that--
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.280]   Developers, people, developers.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.520]   Somebody said, oh, that must mean Vic got a hotel.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   Or maybe Kevin said this, Vic got a hotel room in San Francisco.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.080]   Yeah, that was pretty funny.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.520]   He's not driving up for Mountain View, that's for sure.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.280]   Yeah, I mean, there are a couple of announcements
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.160]   that I thought were going to happen today that didn't.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.760]   So I'm kind of holding out hope for tomorrow.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   So I actually am going to be there at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.600]   I guess it means we have to do our live coverage again,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.120]   because-- Yeah.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   What was missing in the talk?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.240]   What did you expect that you did not hear?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.960]   I expected to hear a lot more about Android.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   We didn't hear too much about Android.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.360]   There was zero Chrome OS and Android talk.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.240]   Zero.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.800]   Well, there was some Chrome talk, right?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.720]   So they announced the Chrome Web Store.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.640]   So that was something Chromium related.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.880]   But yeah, no, not as much Chrome or Chrome OS as I expected.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.200]   But the Chrome Web Store is probably the most exciting thing
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   I thought for developers.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.480]   So we'll hold off--
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.160]   we can speculate on what Android announcements there might be.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.400]   Apparently, Tim Brace as tomorrow is Android Day.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.900]   OK.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.680]   So it'll be worth getting up at 8.30.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.180]   OK.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.200]   Oh, god.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.120]   Especially since you all got the phones,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.240]   there's got to be a payoff here.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.040]   Yeah, I mean, they gave everybody who came to the conference.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.840]   From the US, they gave a Motorola Droid.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.040]   And because that's CDMA, they gave the GSM Nexus 1
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.920]   to the international developers who came.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Yep.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.960]   And still no 2.2 pushed out.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.080]   I was hoping I was looking for FroYo.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   FroYo?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.760]   Maybe tomorrow.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   FroYo, where are you?
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.080]   All right.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.240]   Well, let's talk about--
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.640]   so how big a crew was it in there?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160]   Was it a large audience?
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.400]   So I think it was 5,000 developers and attendance.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.600]   Holy cow.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.440]   In total, I don't know that all those developers
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.120]   were in that room.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.200]   But it was packed.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.920]   It was pretty packed.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.720]   I was there fairly early and didn't get a seat anywhere.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.600]   Really near the front.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.240]   There's go three nodes left in San Francisco.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.680]   Not to mention that didn't do.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   It was shoulder to shoulder.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.000]   And I definitely got to the coffee table and everything
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.680]   but the decaf was already gone.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.080]   Oh, perfect.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.600]   Oh.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.840]   They served breakfast in the morning.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.320]   Burnt.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.040]   Yeah, I got there pretty early.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.480]   This is my first I/O. And I was all worried about being late.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.120]   But checking in was--
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.200]   you scan a barcode.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.040]   I had the email from Google on my phone.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.200]   And I scanned that barcode in the email
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   and printed out my badge.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.720]   And it was done.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.440]   There was no line.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.200]   That was great.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.680]   But actually, filing into the exhibit hall.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.160]   It was exciting.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400]   It's a lot of guys and t-shirts, as one would
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.600]   expect at a developer conference.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.800]   Kind of shoulder to shoulder with their laptops and iPads
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   and Nexus 1s.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.840]   I was trying really hard to snap pictures with my Nexus 1
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   and just upload them to Picasa.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.760]   But the reception wasn't great in there.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.640]   And the Wi-Fi was very, very spotty, which
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.400]   became apparent during one of their demos.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.920]   I think that was kind of embarrassing for them.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.560]   They were doing an HTML5 demo of--
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.760]   I guess it was clicker.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.440]   And he said, I can't get online.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.240]   And then later, they did another developer demo of a new app
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.880]   that they built with Google Web Toolkit.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.800]   It had an iPad and Nexus 1 side by side.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   And wanted to show, hey, when you add this record,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.840]   it just pops up automatically on this other device.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   And it didn't.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.800]   And it was painful.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.960]   And it was embarrassing.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   Everybody really wanted it to work.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.360]   And it wasn't quite working.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.560]   They had to try it once or twice.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.960]   And there was nervous laughter.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.960]   Everyone applauded when it finally did work.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.880]   But it's one of those things where you're just like,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.160]   this shouldn't happen.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.120]   And they have speaker-specific Wi-Fi.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.640]   But still, even that was kind of spotty.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   So that was a bit painful.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   But the rest was very fun.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   It became pretty clear.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.160]   I mean, we covered it live as part of our new initiative
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.680]   to do more live coverage on Twitch.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.600]   We covered it live here.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.520]   Tom Merritt and I were watching and watching your wave as you
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.600]   and Kevin and Adam Pash waved what was going on in there.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.080]   And it became pretty clear right away
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.960]   that Google did not see this as Apple, for instance,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.520]   sees as WWDC keynote as a big public event.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.240]   They were talking to developers, weren't they?
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.560]   It was very developer-heavy.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.680]   And I was saying this earlier, for better or for worse,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.280]   Apple set this precedent that their developer conference
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   involves this big, exciting consumer product launch.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.800]   So you go to something like I/O.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.240]   And I was hoping for something like big Google TV launch today.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   Or I was thinking that something as big as the iPad
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   or the iPhone was going to happen.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   And there was a lot of really great news for developers,
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.200]   but it was very, very developer-specific.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.480]   I mean, at one point, they were running--
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.200]   they had the command lineup on a Ubuntu desktop
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.520]   and we were watching text output flyby on the big screens.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.160]   And I was like, wow, this wouldn't ever happen at WWDC keynote
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.400]   ever in a million years.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.560]   So in a way, I was like, oh, yes, this is wonderful.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.600]   These are my people.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.520]   But at the same time, I was like, oh, this is boring.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.320]   Do you think, Jeff, that Google missed an opportunity?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.040]   I mean, here's a chance to speak to the world.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.760]   I mean, I at first thought, oh, well, maybe nobody's watching.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.480]   But then all the Twitter trending topics in the US
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.040]   were about Google I/O.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.560]   They're people we're watching.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.040]   Yeah, but I think that the future to Google's success
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.160]   is the developer community.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.760]   And so doing something just aimed at them,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   I think makes a lot of sense.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.600]   What it does say is what they have to do too is a consumer piece.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.720]   They had zeitgeist in London last week.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.200]   And as I tweeted, what do I have to do
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   to get invited to this write-a-freakin' book?
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   But that's aimed at a very high-end community.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.520]   The developer event, I think when you look
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.320]   at the future of Chrome and the future of Android,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.560]   it rests entirely on developers' shoulders.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.480]   So I think making really nice developers
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.280]   and talking directly to them about the things that matter
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.760]   to them, I think makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.440]   But they also need-- they're becoming more--
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.400]   they are a consumer brand.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.200]   They're the number one consumer brand in the world
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   for God's sakes.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.800]   They've got to speak to consumers.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.280]   And there is no event that they could do that.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.200]   I mean, this is their event.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.440]   There is no other event.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.680]   They could make an event.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.280]   I think they could make an event.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.080]   And I think they should make another event for consumers,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.000]   for product launches, for consumers.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   This wasn't the right stage to expect a big consumer launch.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.360]   And that was probably partially my mistake.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.680]   It was great for developers.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.360]   But I think for the public watching--
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.760]   for people who are just kind of interested in Google,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.600]   I think that it probably was a disappointment.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.640]   Although, I'm not sure.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.880]   I mean, what was the reception like?
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.600]   I didn't get to watch Twitter too closely.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.640]   I was watching it.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.720]   They were just bullet pointing.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.280]   Kevin Marks, you're a developer as well.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   I mean, you developed--
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280]   Well, last development.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.240]   Well, how about you?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.720]   Ribbit is a plug-in for Wave.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.560]   Did you get the message received from Google?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   Well, I mean, I think what you're saying is right.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.360]   I think the second half of the keynote
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.800]   was a very dense thing that was aimed
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.960]   at the in-house developers who worked
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.560]   with a particular toolset.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.960]   And it was very interesting for them.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.560]   But the rest of us were like, where's the--
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.880]   if we're waiting for Android, we're
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.880]   all clearly in the wrong keynote.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.440]   Right.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.480]   The stuff they announced earlier on and the upfront stuff
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.560]   was interesting.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   The VP8 announcement is obviously very interesting.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   Yes.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   Getting the commitments to HTML5 and a bunch of other people
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.200]   was also good.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.320]   And the other stuff was--
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.360]   I think they were covering different set of audiences
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.920]   with different bits of the keynote.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.520]   You said that.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.360]   You noted that in the Wave.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.000]   You said, OK, now this is apparently--
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.840]   we've gone to corporate developers.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.760]   Well, they were talking about hosting general applications
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   and we were talking about App Engine.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.760]   What do they call it?
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.080]   App Engine Professional or something like that?
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   App Engine for Business.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.120]   App Engine for Business.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.600]   And then they were saying-- and we can second source this
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.320]   with VMware and Spring and deploy it to more than one place.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.080]   So it's a whole bunch of stuff that corporate developers
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.120]   think, oh, that's really important.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.360]   I've got second sourcing.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.120]   I can write stuff in Java and it's great.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.320]   And all the web people are going, hm,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.040]   a child, why do we have to write that again?
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.320]   So it's a slightly different set of communities.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.520]   So they were addressing two communities
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.720]   in the two halves of the thing.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.520]   The first half was the web people
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.800]   who were building all the websites,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.920]   who were building front-end stuff, and back-end stuff
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.960]   in the dynamic languages.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.360]   And then the second half was clearly
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.560]   a bunch of people who targeted the Java programmers who were,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.720]   a lot of them are writing the in-house things.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.360]   They were saying, look, here's our expense reporting app.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.600]   That's our example application.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   You should be excited about this.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.040]   And everyone's going, what?
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.840]   Is that exciting?
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.360]   Yes.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.960]   And the expense report was for $150 dinner.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.800]   And you're kind of like, when's the last time--
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.080]   I was thinking, when's the last time I expensive $150 dinner?
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.880]   Clearly, I'm working on doing the wrong--
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.040]   I'm working for the wrong company.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.920]   I need to be working for a big company.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.680]   Developers actually started to leave toward the end.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.480]   People were getting up and leaving.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.600]   It wasn't a mass exodus, but it was certainly several developers
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.440]   were getting up and leaving, which surprised me.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.520]   Because I had this thing in my mind,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.800]   there's going to be one last big thing.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.280]   Then there really wasn't.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.560]   There were at least two things that
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.840]   could have been the last big thing.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.480]   We thought there would be a Google TV announcement,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.120]   Fro-Yo, or something having to do with Android
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.480]   seemed to be on the docket.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.800]   Now maybe tomorrow, that's when they'll announce those two things.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.200]   Was there anything else missing that we expect?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.000]   Oh, everybody said that Google was going to do an S3 competitor.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.360]   Google Storage, yeah.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.200]   Google Storage, I mean--
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.240]   They missed it, didn't they?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.600]   Well, they announced it on the blog,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   and they did an asset for developers.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.800]   Not for end users as S3 is.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.640]   And is Google Storage part of App Engine for business?
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.480]   Or is it separate?
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   It just shows a little disjointedness
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.800]   in terms of Google's messaging.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.600]   Because while the keynote's going on,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.280]   their blog post goes live about this storage for developers,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   and they tweet about it, and I'm watching Twitter going,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.160]   there's a Google I/O tweet that has nothing to do with the keynote
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.680]   that we're watching right now.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.480]   I can't figure it out.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.280]   Are they out of order?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.000]   What happened?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   So it was just surprising.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.240]   It's not really a criticism.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.200]   You're right, Gina, in some ways it's kind of refreshing.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.240]   I think what Polly is is that they've--
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.400]   this is their big bang to announce a lot of stuff,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.720]   and some stuff makes to the keynote,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.600]   and some stuff is going out in sessions.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.040]   So they announced the Google Font Directory
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.600]   and the Font API stuff, which is a nice project.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.280]   And it's a whole bunch of other stuff
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.320]   that they'll be rolling out.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   They'll be talking about buzz APIs and things.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.120]   And some stuff got put into the keynote
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.280]   because that was a core message.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.720]   But because there are any webcasting
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.760]   a bit of the conference, the rest of these announcements
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.800]   seem a bit fuzzy.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.600]   But basically, it's just like everyone inside Google
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.160]   has been lining stuff up to talk about it this week,
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.360]   and they want to announce it there so they can share the developers
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   and have the conversation with developers in the building.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.840]   So they should just have a summary of what else is going on.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.360]   They're not thinking like media, oddly.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.600]   It is good.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   Right.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.360]   They just had a blog post saying, here's everything
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.000]   that happened today.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.240]   I'm not going to do roundouts.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.760]   But Google is very distributed.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.560]   There's lots of teams working on different things,
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.640]   and they all get a little time slot here.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.920]   And actually, pulling that together
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.520]   is going to be hard for them.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   They're not going to--
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   You can hire an opportunity to do what I think.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.800]   One big message to talk company.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.080]   No, no, that's true.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.520]   But I think you could hire one producer for the day who says,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.840]   OK, let's get it all together.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.560]   Anyway, here we are criticizing the showbiz of it.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:31.880]   Right.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.400]   It's kind of fine because it just shows--
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.200]   you know, a slick Google might scare me, to be honest.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.700]   Right.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.520]   It kind of makes you happy that they're just
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   a little kind of disorganized.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.720]   Don't you want it like engineer?
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.280]   It's like the federal government.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.040]   We're kind of glad they're a little inept
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   because the last thing you want to--
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   They scare you.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.680]   --is a super efficient Google.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.240]   They really know what they're doing.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.720]   Gosh.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   They're so--
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   They're so--
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.880]   They're so scary.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.600]   All right, well, let's talk about-- we do have-- there
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.680]   were some, I think, significant announcements.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.040]   And I want to parse those in just a second.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.360]   I think something really big to talk about.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.880]   But first, before we do that, I would
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.840]   like to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show and the network.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.320]   They sponsored for the first time our breaking coverage
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.440]   this morning.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.320]   And we're really thrilled to have them because I use them.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.760]   I know Jeff, you use them as well.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.160]   We're talking about Slingbox.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.520]   It's a way to watch your favorite TV shows when you're away
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.280]   from home.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.800]   And if you haven't yet tried a Slingbox,
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.720]   you're going to love this.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.640]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.240]   It's very simple.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.480]   There are three steps.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.160]   You buy a Slingbox.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.760]   You connect it to your DVR or your cable, whatever TV inputs
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.800]   you have at home.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.240]   And you connect it to the internet.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.760]   That's it.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.000]   There's no step four.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.880]   Now you can on almost any device.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.040]   Law your BlackBerry, your iPhone, your iPod Touch with Wi-Fi,
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.000]   Mac or Windows.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.320]   Log on and see what's coming out of your cable box anywhere
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.200]   you are in the world, as long as you get internet access.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.920]   The quality is fantastic.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.480]   You have a remote control that lets you
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.560]   control these devices, reset recordings, and so forth.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.800]   So here's my suggestion.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.520]   Go to Best Buy, buy a Slingbox, bring it home,
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.360]   hook it up.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.160]   Within a minute, five minutes, you'll
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.760]   be able to watch Slingbox.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   And the new iPhone application is great
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.880]   because you can do it on Wi-Fi or 3G.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   There are applications coming for other platforms,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.960]   like the Android is just around the corner.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.320]   I've been playing with the beta.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.160]   I'm sure they've got an iPad app coming.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.920]   That's going to be the killer app.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.560]   Slingbox on the iPad will be Bing, Presto.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.600]   In fact, it's not just when you travel just anywhere
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.120]   in the house.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.320]   If you've got a Slingbox hooked up,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.680]   you'll be able to walk around and watch TV.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.600]   Check out Slingbox.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   They're at a Best Buy near you.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.800]   Go to slingbox.com for more information.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.000]   And we thank Slingbox not only for supporting the network,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.440]   but also for helping us do more breaking news.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.800]   Because that's really one of the things
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.760]   I really wanted to do with the network in general,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.360]   is when stories, when there's tech news out there,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.560]   I want to be able to cover it.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.960]   And Sling is making that possible.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.160]   So thank you, Slingbox.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.000]   Slingbox.com for more information,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   or just head out to a Best Buy near you.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.080]   So there were some announcements.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.680]   In fact, nothing that we didn't expect.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.720]   I think the VP8 announcement was expected.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.280]   Kevin, as the guy who did QuickTime,
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.800]   I think you probably best able to explain what this means.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.120]   OK, I'll give it a go.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.840]   So there's been a long running battle over video formats,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.480]   audio and video formats, on the web.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.960]   And back in the '90s and 2000s, we had basically
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.600]   QuickTime and Microsoft and Real fighting over this.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.680]   And if you want to play a video, you had to pick one
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.040]   or put more than one format up.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.000]   And if you wanted to do it in a browser,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.640]   you had to download the software.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   You had to put a plug in.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.520]   It's a download a plug in.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.080]   Yeah, you put up a plug in to do that.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.800]   When Flash added video, because Flash--
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.200]   I wrote about this a couple of years ago.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.960]   So when Flash added video to Flash,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.200]   the value that they had was that Flash was already
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.280]   installed in 95% of browsers.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.080]   Where at the other time?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.640]   Not to play back video.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.440]   I think a lot of people think of Flash as a video player,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.840]   but not to play back video.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.360]   But--
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.480]   No, no, it was very interactivity.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.440]   It was widgets and stuff.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.640]   It was originally Future Splash in 1993 or whatever it was.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   And it was Vectors.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.680]   And it was a vector system.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.240]   And then they added more features over time
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.320]   and made it more of an interactive programming system,
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   sure.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.720]   And then they added video--
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.400]   I can't remember exactly when 2002, 2001, something like that.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.560]   And they picked a fairly old and not great video
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.960]   codec for it.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.200]   But because they were broadly installed,
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.880]   and they'd actually focused on getting
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   installed in as many browsers as possible
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.440]   and not being annoying.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.720]   Whereas everyone else seemed to have some second order agenda
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.120]   that--
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:18:59.560]   Oh, god.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.560]   Real networks was a--
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.080]   --kind of--
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   --of a combination.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.040]   --of a pop-up ads and destroy themselves.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.560]   Microsoft and Real are about getting
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.360]   the data down to the player and selling ads in the player.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.720]   And there was always some kind of annoyance there.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.200]   Whereas Flash focused really well on getting it everywhere.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.320]   So they became the thing that you used to play video.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.160]   Now, their code wasn't very good.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.480]   Was it--
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   --sorensen?
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.520]   Was that what they were using?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.120]   They were using--
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   yeah, the Sorensen one.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.720]   And then they were using VP3.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.520]   And they do it VP6 now as the kind of default codec.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.000]   Well, no, no.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.800]   What they switched to was--
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.680]   So then there was-- so then there's H.264.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.840]   Now H.264 is the successor to MPEG video.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.920]   MPEG video was what we used for--
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.600]   Quick time.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:45.960]   --video.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.880]   Back in-- yeah.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   But no, quick time I had our whole pile of weird code.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.520]   That's right.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.360]   You hit a bunch of them, didn't it?
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   MPEG was standardized.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.280]   So MPEG-4 was like the iteration of the standardized video.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.520]   We use MPEG-2 for broadcast TV, for example.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.200]   So MPEG-4 was an iteration of that.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.680]   And one of the codecs in that was H.264.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.120]   And that was standardized by-- Apple worked to help
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.200]   standardize that and get that in there.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.280]   And it was standardized as part of a Blu-ray format.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.720]   And it's been built into a lot of cameras
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.120]   and there's chipsets for it.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.160]   So H.264 is the day factor standard for video now.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.800]   And it's what everyone will now play.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.040]   So--
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   And it's a good codec.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.320]   It has a lot of features.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.280]   I mean, it scales beautifully, depending on your bandwidth.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.680]   It works in almost any bandwidth.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.640]   It gives you something.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.680]   So it's there and it works.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.240]   But it has expensive licensing, which
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.480]   means you can't distribute it with an open source browser.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.320]   You can't distribute open source versions of it.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.000]   Or rather, that's not strictly true
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.840]   because the way the licensing works,
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.360]   you can distribute open source versions
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.800]   as long as you don't distribute many.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.520]   It is kind of weird.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.760]   Basically, what happened was that Apple held a gun
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.200]   to the head of the MPEG-LA a while back
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.080]   and got them to agree this license that was a per unit
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.240]   of royalty but with a floor and a ceiling.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   So below a certain number you didn't pay
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.360]   and above a certain number you just played a flat fee, which
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.720]   means that if you're a large company,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.920]   you can pay the $5 million a year or so and license it,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.200]   which means that Apple and Adobe and Microsoft--
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.240]   No big deal.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.720]   And anyone else who--
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.080]   that scale has a known amount they pay per year.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.240]   So that makes sense though.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   They'll do that compared to--
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.920]   But Mozilla might not want to.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.280]   But Mozilla doesn't want to.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.160]   So Mozilla didn't want to do that.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.600]   So the current battle over video in HTML5
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.200]   was there's now a way to express,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.480]   I want to embed a video here where you just put video,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.600]   here's the file, that's it, embedding an image, which
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.320]   seems like a great thing except getting people
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.000]   to agree on the format of the video
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.720]   is this sort of brings in all this giant standards
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.680]   and patent war.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.480]   And so--
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.320]   Now, how analogous is this to the image tag?
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.280]   Because the image tag doesn't specify JPEG, GIF, or ping.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.160]   The browser renders it.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.920]   And now, as we know, JPEG and GIF are encumbered,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.120]   ping is not.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.840]   JPEG isn't--
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.480]   JPEG's not.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:03.840]   OK.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.080]   And GIF is expired now.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.680]   OK.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.640]   So they're all encumbered.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.160]   And browser renders them all.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   There was a time when--
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.560]   Unisys said, well, we want royalties for GIF.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.480]   A friend of-- when I was at Apple,
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.040]   a friend of mine had one of those Millennium Countdown clocks.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.440]   He'd adjusted to win the GIF pattern expired
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.880]   so that he can un-ship it.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.400]   Oh, how interesting.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.920]   Oh, how funny.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.520]   Because Apple wouldn't pay the royalty.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   Right.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.000]   But in the same way, we've got this issue with audio.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.240]   With MP3, you have to pay money to--
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.160]   It's encumbered as well.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.000]   Front half roses.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.120]   It's encumbered too.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.240]   But all the browsers have sort of dealt with that.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   So what's happened is Mozilla stuck their heels in and said,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.960]   we're not going to pay the money.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.160]   We know when to ship 264.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.000]   There's at the end.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.320]   And then it got into a patent-to-evil type thing.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.200]   It also got into a warning that these patents have some time
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.680]   to run.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.480]   And although the fees are set at that rate at the moment,
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.400]   they're going to go up--
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.920]   the potential can go up in the future.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.680]   They've only agreed the fees for the next two years.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.000]   And clearly, if everyone does send an H.264,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.840]   then the MPEG-L8 suddenly goes, ha-ha.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.680]   Now we can raise our prices on you.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.360]   Now, Microsoft and Apple are both members of MPEG-LA.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.320]   Yes, but that's just because they have a few video patents.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   OK.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.200]   So who determines the course of action
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.480]   that MPEG-LA chooses?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.840]   A combination of the members.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.680]   So Apple-- yeah, Apple and Microsoft
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.400]   would have some votes on that.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.200]   They have a vote, but not all of those.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.760]   But I think they're both paying in more than they get out from it.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.080]   That's right, yeah.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.800]   And you know, part of the point in the patent poll
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.160]   is it's a demilitarized zone.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   It's not just suing each other.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.040]   So they get enough of the patents together that Panasonic
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.400]   and Sony and everyone else who's got patents in that pool,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.720]   Philips, will basically agree not to sue each other.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.360]   You usually assure destruction.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.280]   You sue me.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.920]   I'm going to sue you and the whole thing.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.560]   Yeah, we're seeing that in the phone market at the moment.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   There's a sort of patent going on there.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.800]   But the video stuff has been fairly messy over the years.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.160]   So H.264 is technically very good, but it's patent.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.560]   It's patenting covered.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.200]   There was some thought about Aug Theora, which
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.800]   is an open source.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.880]   So Aug Theora is based on an earlier version of the codec
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.720]   from this group that Google just bought.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.880]   VP3.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.800]   VP3.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.720]   And this is VP8.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.600]   And basically they added one each time they came up
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.520]   with a new way of doing it.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.080]   It was edible.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.760]   So it's pretty old.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.360]   So VP3 was fairly old.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.480]   The quality was-- it was-- it's OK.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.960]   It's not terrible quality.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.480]   And the other thing is, there's this sort of weird thing
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.520]   about codecs where you agree the decoding model first,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.600]   and then over time the encoders get better
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.080]   because they get better at adjusting things
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.760]   to fit that decoding model.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.400]   So a bunch of people are sharing stuff
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.880]   with Theora that looks pretty good and works quite well.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.440]   And there's always a trade-off in quality and bandwidth.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.280]   And to some extent, there's not a huge difference
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   in how these codecs work.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.160]   There's just some subtleties there.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.960]   Microsoft has VC1, which basically they took 264
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.360]   and then iterated on a bit more and tuned it
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.600]   more for their processors.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.680]   And that is actually a bit nicer than 264.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.640]   But Microsoft will give it away free,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.920]   but they won't give you a source license.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.200]   And so that sort of found it on their inability
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.040]   to open source it as well, if you like.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.480]   So what we have with VP8 is something
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.640]   that Google has bought the IP to.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.920]   They bought the engineers to work on it.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.720]   And now they said they're going to open source that
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.240]   and build it into this WebM project, which
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.760]   is at webmproject.org, which is the idea
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.360]   is they're going to use the Matroska Media Container.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:48.840]   You're kidding.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   It's using Matroska?
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.600]   Oh, dear.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   Volbus Audio and VP8 Video.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.040]   I didn't hear the Matroska part.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.440]   I haven't actually looked at the Matroska containers,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.880]   but that's the way we've run with them.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.000]   It's widely used on pirated video.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's how I know about it.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.880]   But I haven't actually looked.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.640]   I don't know the data structure, but I don't know.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.720]   And the only reason I'm very aware of it
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.640]   is because it's very difficult to play back on some hardware.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.040]   Apple TV, for instance, you have to unwrap the Matroska
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.680]   wrapper to get to the underlying MP4,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.440]   so you could play it back.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.920]   Are those MKV files?
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.720]   That's MKV.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.520]   Yeah, those are always a pain.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.360]   They're ugly.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.400]   Yeah, they're ugly.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.040]   But it's all about implementation.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.200]   I haven't looked at the inside of it,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.000]   so I can't come in the right to do this.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.240]   It's interesting that I didn't pick Ogg as the format,
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   because I have some issues with Ogg,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.280]   but I haven't looked at Matroska enough to--
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.880]   Apple made noise that--
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.360]   well, remember Steve Jobs' email,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.720]   and Microsoft has said the same thing,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.200]   that Theora is not as unencumbered as one might think.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.560]   So there was this issue of what they call submarine patterns.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.200]   So when I was at Apple, I spent a chunk of time
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.960]   working on QuickTime.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.600]   I was trying to get them to ship Vorbis as part of QuickTime,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.000]   because I thought it was an interesting codec.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.840]   Is it audio-only codec, right?
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   It's an audio-only codec.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.760]   It's a nice codec.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.080]   It has some slight witnesses to it,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.240]   but it's because it's not--
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.440]   Well, I can go into these as well.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   It's quite clever in that it divides--
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.120]   it has variable-sized chunks, depending on whether it's
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.240]   trying to encode something that's percussive,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.880]   or something that's tonal.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.920]   And so most audio codecs have fixed-sized chunks,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.400]   and it has variable-sized chunks,
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.000]   and it can use different bits for that.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.320]   So it's VBR, but it's even VBR within the packet.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.920]   It's VBR, but it's VBR at a sort of low-level structure
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.960]   which makes it quite hard to write code to deal with.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.160]   But anyway, we could have worked around that.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.360]   But I ran into this same thing.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.680]   I went to the gapple guy and said, I want to ship this.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   And they said, well, OK, let's talk about the--
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.960]   can we license this from someone?
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.880]   I said, no, no, it's open source.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.440]   We can ship it.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.720]   And they said, well, no, you can't, because if you do,
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.640]   we could get sued.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.440]   And if we get sued by the MPLA, we
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.240]   won't be able to play DVDs anymore,
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.840]   and we should be in machines that play DVDs.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.080]   And thank you very much.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.840]   If you stop us doing that, then I'm going to be in trouble.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.360]   And so their whole worry was because they've signed up
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.120]   to the patent pools, most of these patent pools,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.360]   and they're a big enough target to sue,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.400]   they didn't want us to happen.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.800]   And they've still said this consistently
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.640]   in the HTML5 discussions about their maybe submarine
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.200]   patents.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   We may get sued by Dolby.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.280]   We may get sued by Fraunhofer Lambs.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   We may get sued by somebody else over Vorbis.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.440]   We may get sued over the video patents.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.960]   That could happen too.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.720]   And we're not willing to take this risk.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.200]   And basically, Google today said,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.000]   we're willing to take that risk.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.040]   We're going to ship this thing.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.480]   We're going to open source it.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.160]   If you have submarine patents, hire
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.400]   where a big target comes sewers.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.680]   They've not quite so many words.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.200]   But effectively, they've said, we're
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.040]   going to call the bluff of this sort of fear
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.200]   about submarine patents.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.840]   Because this is a good thing to do.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.440]   And I think it is a good thing to do.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.040]   I suspect we're not going to get rid of 264 or even
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.560]   the other older formats overnight,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.040]   because we have a bunch of devices will only play those,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.440]   because they're hardware.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.680]   What they said was-- and it wasn't quite
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   clear exactly what they said.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.320]   They said that in converting the YouTube videos to this format,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.440]   starting with the 720p and up ones.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.720]   So what they may end up doing is saying,
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.200]   OK, we're going to do the highest bandwidth stuff using VP8.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.560]   And then the lower quality ones will use 264/4,
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.000]   so they will still play on your Apple devices.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.680]   But the better looking stuff will be using this new code.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.120]   And the other piece that the sort of surrounded announcements
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.000]   was they had Mozilla and Opera standup
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   and said they support it, which is not surprising.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.280]   This is exactly what Mozilla wanted,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   an open source code that they can ship.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.480]   But they also had Kevin Lynch of Adobe
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.400]   saying that Adobe is going to ship VP8
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.680]   in the next version of Flash.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.240]   And there was also a note from Microsoft
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.200]   saying, if you install a VP8 codec on Windows,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.680]   we'll play VP8 too, which is slightly disingenuous.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.920]   So they didn't say if you install a Matroska importer
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   and brawler, but they were basically saying,
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.440]   because IE8 delegates media playback to the operating system,
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.200]   if you can get the operating system to play it,
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.840]   Internet Explorer will play it too.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.280]   Seems like they should just bundle the damn codec.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.400]   But--
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.240]   Yeah, they're just playing it.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.960]   Both halves of that are tricky.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:28.040]   So Safari and IE basically delegate this to the OS,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:34.640]   whereas Firefox and Chrome try and embed the stuff themselves.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.920]   And they will call plugins in some circumstances,
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   but not others.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.360]   So I found this where I was trying to do an audio show like this.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.240]   We're using Shoutcast, which I thought everyone could play
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.160]   because it's just mp3 files stuck together in a long thing.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.760]   And Chrome wouldn't play it because Chrome
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.240]   wasn't delegating it back to anything.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.840]   It was just saying, don't understand.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.240]   I'm going to give you an error dialogue,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.000]   rather than throwing it out to flash or quick time
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.760]   or whatever else people have installed.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.880]   So that was interesting for me to see that the assumption
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.800]   that I was making that this is an old format, everything
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.520]   can play it, is now getting broken
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.400]   because they're tying the formats up
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.200]   with the actual browsers that are running them.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:19.680]   There's a really good post on x264dev.multimedia.cx
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.640]   in which he analyzes vp8.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.280]   And I don't know if he's known or respected in the community
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.360]   or if he knows what he's talking about,
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.840]   but he does have a lot to say about it.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.200]   One of which is that the spec for vp8
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.160]   is basically ccode from--
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.480]   it's the source code.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.560]   So it's not an easy spec to decode, if it were.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.600]   He also says the Matros--
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.200]   I'll read that.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.920]   Yeah, it's x.264dev.multimedia.cx.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.360]   He says Matroska is actually a good container.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.520]   He says it's not even very surprising they chose it.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.040]   It's one of the most widely used, quote, "modern" container
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.080]   formats and is in many ways best suited to the task.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.160]   He says MP4, which is another container, is not very flexible.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.760]   Also, Matroska has streaming in the spec.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.240]   I like to hear that.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.200]   You don't have to do the hacky chunk streaming
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.080]   that MP4 does.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.720]   Well, streaming in the spec can be
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.440]   a damage.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.920]   I mean, that's basically why Aug is bad,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.800]   because they assume that you were streaming.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.000]   And they basically encoded packet sizes into the spec,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   which makes it quite hard to generalize it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.920]   OK.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.240]   I should read up more--
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.880]   I would love to get your take on this.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.280]   He says one possible problem is that since almost nobody
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.400]   currently uses Matroska for live streaming purposes,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.880]   very few existing Matroska implementations
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.120]   support what is necessary to play streamed files.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.720]   He also says that the vp8 spec itself--
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.200]   and again, I'm quoting his bottom line--
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.280]   is significantly weaker than H.264 compression-wise.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:04.440]   He says it is as good as H.264 baseline or VC1, probably
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.800]   better, but not as good as H.264 main.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.880]   So technically, it may not be as good a codec,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.560]   but it might be good enough.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.120]   The choice of Vorbis makes a lot of sense for the audio,
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.400]   since AAC is encumbered and MP3 is encumbered.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.640]   Now, Vorbis is--
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.400]   as I say, it's quite-- is a different audio codec,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.960]   but it's quite interesting.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.440]   And its quality is good.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.880]   Certainly, people in no one's--
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.800]   the complaints about Vorbis have never been--
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.120]   the quality is bad.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.200]   It's like--
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.680]   It's nothing--
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   It's nothing--
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.440]   Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.760]   We put out Vorbis versions of a number of our shows,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.000]   including our open source show.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.520]   We stopped doing that, except for the open source show,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.280]   which is nobody was-- there was literally
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.720]   hundreds of people listening, not thousands.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.220]   Sure.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.640]   Everyone uses MP3s for all the games.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.480]   Yeah, MP3 is kind of lingua franca.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.680]   But the Orbis files were roughly the same size
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.360]   and sounded just as good.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.600]   They actually sound better than MP3 in--
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.000]   that's better.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   --subflate time dynamic range.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.040]   If you've got classical music, then Vorbis
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   tends to sound a bit better because it has that short,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   long packet thing going on.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.360]   But yeah, it's nuanced.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   So--
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   MP3 is pretty old now.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.120]   So there in a nutshell--
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   OK.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.280]   --coaching the channel anyway is--
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:44.100]   I'm going to do the
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.020]   almost all machines now have hardware H.264 encoding built
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.900]   in either through the GPU or the CPU.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.540]   And that makes a big difference in playback and the amount
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.340]   of CPU cycles used and the size of the device.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.460]   They did show a slide, which I quickly tried to parse that
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:06.900]   showed ATI and NVIDIA on the team, as well as Qualcomm,
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.500]   which makes a Snapdragon chip that's
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.060]   used in a lot of phones, a lot of Google phones.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.180]   Apple--
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.980]   I didn't see anything.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.140]   I didn't see ARM, but I might have missed it.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.580]   And I definitely didn't see Intel.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.900]   I was looking hard to see Intel in there.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.260]   So there will be possibly some hardware support down the road.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.740]   And then the other kind of big question mark
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.260]   is what will Apple and Microsoft do?
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.700]   Because, of course, they make two very important browsers.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.420]   Microsoft says that they're going to, as you said,
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.540]   going to include support if you have the codec on IE9.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.060]   Apple's silent on all of this.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.940]   I think it's going to take--
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.700]   Apple's going to have to get behind it if it's going to take off.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.900]   Don't you think that it'll have to be supported
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.220]   in the iPhone and the iPad if it's going to take off?
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.260]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:59.020]   I think that you don't have to at Apple.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.020]   I think Apple may end up doing it at some point.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.660]   I'm not sure how religious they are about it,
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.220]   but they've made a commitment to a particular set of specs.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.660]   And--
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.780]   Is there any reason they wouldn't?
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.500]   I mean, they promote HTML5.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.060]   And if this becomes the HTML5 video standard, which, by the way,
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   that hasn't happened yet either, has it?
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.700]   Well, HTML5 video doesn't define the codecs, as you say.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.460]   So there's no body that would say W3C is not going to say,
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.700]   good, we endorse VPA.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.500]   No, no, that's more of a practice thing.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.100]   That's a practice.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.220]   So that's what the browsers do, not what W3C is.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.100]   That's more of an install-based thing.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.420]   So I think the issue for Apple is that they've
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.380]   got portable devices with low-power CPUs,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.820]   with hardware acceleration to do this stuff.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.500]   And they've designed that with 264 in mind.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.060]   And it's particular profile of 264 and so on.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.180]   And the question is, could you adapt those to do this?
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.060]   And if so, how?
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.740]   And then how would you deploy that?
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.460]   So it's certainly not impossible they could do that.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.700]   They can make that work.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.500]   And it may be that the chipsets will pick up
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.340]   on that in the future.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.620]   But they've still got the issue of,
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.900]   do they want to put that effort in?
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.460]   Or will people keep doing 264 for them?
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.700]   Because you've got to remember that YouTube supporting 264
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.860]   was originally an Apple working together
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.220]   so they could supply something that the iPhones could play.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.100]   At that point, YouTube was still primarily
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:31.100]   using the older Flash codec for most of their staff
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.620]   because of various issues, because it
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.180]   had the broadest install base.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.820]   And it took a while for the 264 stuff
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.860]   to swap over on YouTube.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:45.860]   So I'm sure I'd jina and Jeff if you've fallen asleep.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.020]   No, that's OK.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.540]   Reading videos important to Twitch.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.340]   I'm all about it.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.380]   To me, I'll do that.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.820]   Of course.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.660]   But I think it's important in general.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.180]   I mean, this is a big part of the web these days.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.620]   And YouTube may be the biggest player of all.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.940]   It is the biggest player of all.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.780]   So what YouTube does--
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.020]   Is the biggest player in the video, yeah.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.500]   Yeah, what YouTube does.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.420]   I just have Apple not saying YouTube.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.460]   Right.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.860]   So where does that go here?
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.300]   If Apple refuses to play along, what does that mean?
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.660]   Well, I mean, they could--
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.860]   on the iPhone and the iPad, it launches a YouTube app.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.260]   So it doesn't have to play inside.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.340]   And it plays it basically.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.300]   My understanding it plays it within QuickTime,
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.060]   on the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.980]   The QuickTime player launches.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.740]   The iPad doesn't launch that necessarily.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.940]   The iPad can do embedded.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.980]   I think the YouTube it does to them launch an app.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.220]   But if you embed video in the web on an iPad,
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:37.740]   it--
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.100]   It can play in the window, yeah.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.980]   And it's-- but it's using the QuickTime code.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.340]   Yes.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.780]   Well, some plays a piece of QuickTime.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.740]   I'm not sure it plays everything QuickTime can play.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.500]   But it literally--
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.300]   But here's what I'm asking.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.460]   Does this become an everybody against Apple thing,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.180]   potentially?
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.020]   If Adobe is now playing along--
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.380]   Yeah, I thought it was interesting.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.020]   The Flash, Adobe was there on stage.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.180]   Well, that's the F2D.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:00.780]   Fine.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.740]   Well, play with the Steve.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.420]   Well, go play with the bigger brother over here.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.540]   I called it the Axis of Not Evil.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.540]   Well--
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.140]   I like that.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.540]   Flash-- from Flash's point of view,
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.020]   they want to remain a relevant and useful system
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.900]   for playing stuff back.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.460]   And so if you say, here's a codec we'll do with the IP,
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.380]   you can have it.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.500]   Please distribute it.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.980]   They're going to go, yeah, that's nice.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.700]   That's cheaper than the 264.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.140]   Whenever they've got the same issues as Google
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.260]   and everyone else has with the MPEGLA,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.300]   which is if they become totally reliant on that,
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.220]   MPEGLA can then hold them to Ransom and say, right,
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:41.100]   this year, the pattern license fee is $50 million.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.340]   Not $5 million.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.860]   No.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.740]   So there is an interest for these guys
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.340]   to come up with something like this.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.020]   The challenge has always been, can we stand up to this
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.620]   in court legally?
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.620]   And that's the-- effectively, that's the sort of bet
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.380]   that Google is taking.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.900]   That's the kind of thing that they took when they bought
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.580]   YouTube and got the via-com lawsuit shortly afterwards.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.580]   The bet they took with Google Books,
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.820]   where they took the publisher's lawsuit,
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.460]   and said, OK, we'll fight this.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.940]   And all the bet they did when they invested $5 billion
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.780]   in potentially buying a mobile license
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.540]   to try and get better terms out of that.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.220]   So it's the kind of sort of high-level calculation
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:27.500]   that Google will make to say we will invest some of our treasure,
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.860]   if you like, in doing something like this,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.620]   that will change the environment of the web.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.500]   I think that was the main message of Google I/O in general.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.940]   It was just open standards, promoting innovation,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.060]   using open standards, keeping the web open.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.180]   So this is-- and Colleen made this point earlier.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.260]   I mean, this is Google investing a lot of money
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.980]   into buying something and making it open for everyone
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.660]   to use to make the web better in general for everyone,
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.940]   because when the web's better for everyone in general,
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.940]   it's better for Google.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.620]   Isn't that flipping the bird at Apple, then?
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.140]   Don't we get--
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.660]   Absolutely.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.660]   --to use versus open world here, and that's
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.020]   the modification we're seeing.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.500]   Apple--
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.020]   Definitely.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.660]   --those, high-quality, no porn, all that stuff, right?
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.940]   And Google says that the weapon against that is openness.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.140]   Right.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.100]   Definitely.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.220]   So where does Apple go?
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.780]   So what happens in Apple today?
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.660]   So, but Vic was doing a bit of that at the beginning,
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.980]   who was having a slight poke at Apple.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.140]   And it's not that fair when you're talking about HTML5,
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.540]   because actually, Apple did this visionary thing
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.860]   a few years ago of building WebKit and open sourcing it,
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.980]   and Google is able to build on that, too.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.820]   And you want to give them credit for doing that,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.540]   because that is what's really transformed the browser
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.100]   market.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.900]   And they clearly had the most of it for doing,
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.780]   because they wanted it to run on their devices.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.780]   But they were good enough to open source that,
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.660]   and such, that it's running on the Android devices, too.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.420]   And that does actually broaden up the whole thing.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.460]   So it's the classic, commoditize your compliments thing of,
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.580]   Apple wants to sell hardware.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.780]   Therefore, they want to make sure people
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.340]   can have stuff running on their hardware.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.860]   So they have an interest in open source.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.100]   Google wants to sell to Burtismans.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.780]   So they want to make sure that the web is open enough
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   that it's firewall can be used across all platforms,
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.260]   and no one else can gatekeep that piece from them.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.300]   So they have a strong interest in it not being locked down
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.580]   in any way that's going to restrict them.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.300]   So there are tensions at the edges there.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.860]   But the value in the long run is that we get open source
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.020]   technologies that we can use in many other environments.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.300]   And that is encouraging.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.740]   It is interesting, though, that Google rumored in Froyo
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.420]   in 2.2.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.740]   Maybe, Gina, you can comment on this.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.540]   When you launch the browser, pushes you to a Flash 10.1 site,
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.660]   where Flash-enabled websites are featured,
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.020]   that Google is-- there may be a little tit for tat here.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:56.460]   Adobe may have been on stage today in gratitude to Google
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.900]   for really pushing the fact that Android supports Flash.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:05.300]   Have you seen this, Lee, or has someone written up
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.300]   like an early builder for you?
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.180]   It was a write-up.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.740]   Let me see if I can--
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.180]   So does this mean that my Android phone's battery is going to--
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.740]   Go down.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.820]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.220]   They're really pushing 10.1 on Froyo.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.420]   I know you've all--
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.340]   About the Flash thing, it's like, I
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.940]   hope that it's just not a matter of lower standards.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.820]   The fact that the job said, Adobe hasn't
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.860]   been able to provide a handheld device running Flash that
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.860]   performed in an adequate to our level.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.340]   I just hope that Google isn't lowering their standards
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.100]   just to be able to flip the bird at Apple and say, well,
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.660]   we're going to work with Adobe.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.620]   I would hope that too.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.620]   And maybe, though, they can rationalize it in their mind
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.220]   because they've also opened this codec up
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.060]   and they're giving it away.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.020]   So Google, maybe just saying, look, we don't care.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.260]   Well, open means not just open source.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:52.900]   It means open.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.780]   It means everything.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.380]   We don't say no to anything.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   Right.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   Right.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.380]   You said earlier something about Google
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.420]   wanting to sell ads with the Chrome Web Store.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.820]   I mean, they're not just going to be selling ads now.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.780]   I mean, they're going to be selling web apps.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:08.740]   Well, let's talk about that.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.020]   That's next.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.420]   That's our next topic.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.780]   I think these are the two big announcements so far today
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.380]   at Google I/O was VP8 and the Chrome Web Store.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.460]   And we're going to talk about the Web Store
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.020]   in just a little bit.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.260]   Gina Tripani is here.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.980]   She's actually in San Francisco for Google I/O
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.420]   and has very kindly decamped from the conference center
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.340]   to next door in the Pixel Core studios,
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.540]   thanks to Pixel Core for letting us use their studios.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.380]   I hope you're not missing anything important, Gina.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.100]   Miss Twig, something important?
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.740]   Twig is my something important.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.140]   Look at this over where they need to go back.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.900]   I know.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.900]   We were hoping to do a twig a little bit earlier,
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.460]   but you did go to the wave.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:44.980]   I did.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.700]   I had to go to the wave fireside chat
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.940]   because I just had to see the wave team in person.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:49.620]   That was really fun.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.820]   Yeah, and I can't leave that out.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.220]   There was also a big wave announcement.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:52.620]   Well, which was--
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.300]   There was.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:53.740]   There was.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.380]   It'll be my tip.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.620]   Which made Gina smile.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.300]   Also with us, of course, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.100]   He's in his home, but he's back in the States
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.780]   after a trip to Canada.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.220]   And he's at the website buzzmachine.com.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.060]   Great to have you, Jeff.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.420]   And Kevin Marks from British Telecom and Ribbit.com.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.540]   More to come in just a moment before we go much further,
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.540]   though, I would like to say hello to our friends at Citrix
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.620]   and the folks who give you a go to meeting, go to my PC,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.740]   and the ultimate tool for people who have to help others.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.580]   And if you listen to this show, chances
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.180]   are you're the tech support person.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.860]   For quite a few people, family, friends,
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.620]   maybe you even work in the business.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.900]   You ought to know about go to Assist Express.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.780]   I've been using it since the screensavers' days
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.420]   to fix people's computers.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.100]   The latest version of go to Assist Express
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:45.180]   is incredible, fast, effective, secure, works on Macs and PCs.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.100]   So you can support anybody anywhere.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.500]   In fact, recently named the worldwide market leader
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.100]   in remote support by Frost and Sullivan.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.100]   It's the number one remote support solution
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.340]   because it's easy to use.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.620]   It's affordable.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.420]   It's secure.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.020]   You don't have to pre-install software
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.140]   and your customer's computers either.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.020]   You just send them a link.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.620]   And within less than a minute, they're ready to go.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.460]   They can set it up so you have unintended access.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.020]   You can run up to eight sessions at once,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.980]   which means you can get an install going or a fix
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.500]   and go to the next machine and the next machine.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.740]   So you waste no time waiting.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.340]   You can get an assay of what software is running on that machine,
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.580]   including the operating system and any security software
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.180]   running in the background.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.060]   It's just a really handy tool.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.020]   They have day passes.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.020]   That's what I do.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.860]   I stack up all my support requests, and then I do a day pass.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.180]   But a month to month is good, too, if you do a lot of support.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.780]   From Citrix, everything you do, 128-bit SSL encrypted,
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.700]   24/7 customer support.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.980]   Try it right now, free for 30 days.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.660]   You know, this might be enough to get it all done.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.740]   Just go to go to assist.com/twig.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.100]   And yours is yours for free for 30 days.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:58.100]   G-O-T-O-Assist.com/twig.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:58.980]   We thank them so much.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.020]   Citrix is such a great supporter of the Twit Network.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.060]   We thank you.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:05.940]   Citrix, for all you do for us.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.780]   So tell us, Gina, about the web app store.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.340]   I thought this was very interesting,
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.180]   but I wasn't sure I quite understood it.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.460]   For instance, it's in Chrome.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.460]   Does it require Chrome?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.700]   There are many questions.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.780]   So it's not available yet.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.820]   It's going to come out in the developer preview.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.260]   No.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.020]   OK.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:22.820]   OK, that's good.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.940]   So it's just going to show up in the new tab in Chrome,
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.620]   I think, by default.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.460]   I think that's what they're saying.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.060]   That's what's called there.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:37.220]   But if-- OK, so if I'm running Safari or Firefox,
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.580]   do I go to a site that's chrome.google.com/webapps,
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.020]   and then buy stuff there, and then how does it get--
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.180]   I don't understand.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.020]   Yeah, I mean, most likely, yeah, you'd hit a URL.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.100]   I wasn't clear on this.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.700]   They didn't get to real deep detail about how this is going
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.060]   to work.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.300]   But my understanding was that you'd
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.780]   have to sign in to--
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.180]   so you open Chrome, or you go to this page,
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.300]   and it has featured apps with reviews and ratings,
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.980]   and with the ability-- with prices.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.220]   Some could have prices.
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.260]   I say show clients versus zombies, which is not a free program.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.580]   It's in Flash.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:10.940]   Right.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.460]   It's in Flash.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.100]   So it's basically like buying a mobile app or buying a game.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.380]   So I assume that you would purchase license or rights
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.220]   to use it through Google Checkout.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.380]   And I assume that you'd probably have to be signed in
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.940]   to your Google account in order to say, hey, I have access
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.100]   to this app or not.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.820]   But I actually haven't had a chance to watch the demo video.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.020]   If you go--
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:31.740]   Web Store.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.180]   I said it wrong.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:38.740]   The chrome.google.com blog/webstore says that,
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.460]   because web apps listed in the Chrome Web Store,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.820]   are regular web apps built in standard web tools
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.180]   that can be used by anyone using a, quote, modern browser
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.860]   that supports these technologies.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.660]   HTML5 or--
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.580]   Let's get the advantage of installing an app from a Chrome
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.780]   Web Store.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.300]   When you install, quote, surround that, a web application
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.660]   in the store, a convenient shortcut
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.860]   is added for quickly accessing the app.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:02.060]   Install web apps can also request advanced HTML5 permissions.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.260]   So I'm guessing what you're doing
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.260]   is you're buying access to the app, the way you buy access
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.980]   to, well, I don't know, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.460]   Right.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.100]   But in Chrome, you get a shortcut to it,
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:11.980]   and it's always there.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.860]   And then I guess with HTML5, I've
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.540]   got to believe that you go back to the Gears view that there
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.100]   is offline use of an app you bought.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.460]   Right?
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.140]   Well, you know, Chrome has this concept of native code,
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.340]   where you can write code that actually interacts with your desktop,
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.900]   with loggers on your desktop.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.100]   And probably Kevin knows more about this.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.500]   But so you can actually build extensions that sort
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.900]   of bridge that gap between your desktop and the browser.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.540]   So I'm thinking that maybe those apps will be Chrome only.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:45.140]   And maybe those apps, you know, things like image editors
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.660]   and maybe really rich games might be Chrome only.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.460]   Is this really, though, all about Chrome OS?
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.820]   I mean, remember--
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.300]   --remembers about the architecture of that,
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.100]   where you have a browser-based functionality,
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:05.460]   an application world, and Google is just jump-starting it.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.180]   So I can get rid of my GoB Photoshop,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.940]   and I can use the photo application that was demonstrated
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.340]   today, and I can pay for it.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.140]   And Google's enabling that, so it gets more web development,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.940]   which gets us away from Apple and Microsoft worlds, no?
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.340]   And I mean, it's just a way to find kind of a curated
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.700]   or ranked or like this one place to find good web apps.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.300]   And it's also a way also for developers to build web apps
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.860]   that generate revenue without relying solely on ads.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.500]   But it's not a closed ecosystem as Apple's app stories.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.540]   It sounds like it's a wide open ecosystem.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.060]   Right.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:39.740]   Wide open.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:40.700]   And if a great--
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.860]   --invite developers to do it, find out how to prepare.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.980]   I guess wide open to the extent that it's still curated,
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.900]   as Gina said.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:50.340]   But they keep on saying that it's just regular web applications
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.740]   that are built for modern browsers, period.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.740]   And when I say curated, I think it's just rated by users.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.860]   I think it's totally crowd sourced.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.740]   I don't think that there's going to be an editor at Google
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.860]   saying, yes, this.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.780]   I mean, I think that things are just
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:05.060]   going to get rated kind of dig-style from what I understand.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.140]   They showed this an HTML5 version of Tweeter,
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.940]   which is my favorite-- my Twitter client of my desktop Twitter
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:10.940]   client.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.940]   It looked beautiful.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.420]   It was very nicely done.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.740]   And the ragged drop, everything.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.160]   So what are these advanced HTML5 permissions?
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.040]   What are those?
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.800]   Does anybody know anything about those?
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.640]   What is it?
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.140]   What is it?
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:25.960]   Where's the web development?
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:31.000]   It said this is in the FAQ if you go to chrome.google.com/webstore.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.720]   And I'm wondering if that has anything
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.160]   to do with native code extensions.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:41.720]   It's right here.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.080]   What is the advantage of installing an app from the Chrome
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   web store?
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080]   And--
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.640]   So Blaine was talking about this.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.080]   Blaine-- my colleague Blaine Cook,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.440]   I found one of the founders of Twitter
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.320]   has been looking at building web applications.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.320]   And he's saying HTML offline apps
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.960]   don't quite do everything you want yet.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.400]   So you can get some permissions,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.360]   but you're missing the ability to add a web protocol handler.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.640]   So you can't handle a special kind of URL
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.520]   like iTunes does, for example.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.200]   And it's very hard for you to access an arbitrary website
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.920]   from a locally installed app.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.800]   And because that's not well structured by the--
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.960]   browsers have this same origin policy,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.200]   which means that you can't call code that isn't on the same--
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.040]   Same, same, same.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.840]   You can't call code that isn't on the same site
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.040]   that you're running on.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.240]   The problem is when you've got a local application,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.000]   that means that you can't call code anywhere on the web easily.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.600]   You can't-- because of the same origin policy.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.960]   And so you need a way of getting around that.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.600]   And the way around that is you proxy through a server somewhere,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.080]   which is what we do now.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.040]   But that means you're building dependency
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.240]   on a particular server into your application,
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   which Google is happy about because that's
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   the way they build apps.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.680]   They're running the servers.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.400]   But you're trying to build a standalone app that
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.360]   could deal with a series of different sites.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.160]   Blaine's example is he's an e-book reader,
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.320]   so he wants to be able to fetch an e-book from any site
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.280]   and display that.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.720]   Doing that as a client side app is actually
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.520]   quite difficult at the moment.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.280]   So it's end to end for the developer.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   You can create it.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.120]   You can run it on Google Apps.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.720]   You can get it paid for through Google.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.760]   It becomes an app version of the web kind of.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.520]   Yeah, but it can run offline.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.760]   I mean, you can build a serverless app.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.320]   It strikes me-- I mean, I may be wrong,
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.200]   but it strikes me that this is really all about making Chrome OS
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.800]   be a full-fledged OS.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.080]   If you can't install apps in Chrome OS easily,
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.360]   that's exactly where I can--
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.800]   You got nothing.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.200]   But there's still sandbox in the sense that--
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.160]   do apps have access to the file system?
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:51.840]   They--
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.600]   That's a good question.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.880]   Again, it's still slightly messy.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   Resolving this stuff is under debate
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.040]   at the moment of what they should have
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.640]   and what they shouldn't have.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.160]   And there's--
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.120]   Because you're trading functionality for security
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.280]   at that point.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.200]   Kind of, but it's more that we have a security model that
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.480]   was built for one environment.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:08.980]   Right.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.140]   And trying to apply it in another environment
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.480]   and work out what makes sense there.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:12.980]   Right.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.180]   The other part of this is--
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.440]   we're talking about Google App Stores.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.680]   They've got four of these already.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.240]   Or three or four of these already.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.280]   If you think about iGoogle, like--
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.520]   That's a widget store, I guess.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.320]   Yeah, huh?
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.840]   It's a widget store.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.560]   You can add things to the list.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.960]   You can search and put stuff in.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.920]   There's no payment involved.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.440]   But it has a huge install base of people doing that.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.500]   They have the Android App Store, which I'm hoping they're
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.180]   going to make better tomorrow.
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.220]   It's on the Android.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.300]   It works very nicely.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.740]   But there's these weird things that if I search it on the web,
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.220]   I want to install the Android.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.500]   The way I'm supposed to do that is
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.660]   by taking a photograph of a thing with my Android
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.660]   and then pressing a button there, rather than just saying,
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.300]   OK, yeah, I'll log in here, put it in the queue
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.140]   to download my Android.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.460]   So there's some weirdness about that.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.500]   And you can't easily link to the App Store.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.980]   Right.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.680]   Vic in the keynote said, we've got a great app
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.060]   for the schedule at Google I/O.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.120]   Go to the App Store and search for Google conference
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.000]   to find it.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.440]   It's like--
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.760]   That's a marker that you've got something slightly broken there.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.460]   And then the other one that they released a few months
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:24.160]   ago, which is the apps for Google Apps,
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.320]   your domain store.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.040]   What's that called?
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.320]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:29.820]   Gina?
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.400]   The apps marketplace?
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.040]   Apps marketplace, that's it.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.680]   So that one is similar to this, except that you're installing
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.920]   apps into your Google Apps infrastructure,
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.320]   that can be paid for.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.120]   And the system in can install an app for the whole company
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.080]   with that.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.960]   So it's clear that they've been thinking
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.880]   about this and building different versions of it over time.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.120]   And that's a Google way.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.200]   They have four ways of doing the same thing by different teams.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.840]   So it's interesting to see which of those facets this one
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.760]   will pick up.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.200]   And the challenge is getting people to pay for web apps.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:07.760]   Dario of Cassandra described this as,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.240]   this is the iGoogle Apps for rich people.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.320]   Or at least people with disposable income.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.200]   It's $4.99.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.280]   It's not a whole lot of money.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.560]   But is this new?
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:28.440]   I just see a lot of chatter coming up about the latitude API.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.280]   Was that announced for a little bit?
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.640]   We talked about that a little bit yesterday.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.520]   I mean, last week.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.360]   That was last week.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:34.860]   OK.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.040]   That's not-- the fact that Google has 3 million latitude users.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.080]   I think they announced the API last week.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.580]   OK.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.360]   I don't mind.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.240]   Now they announced them today.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:45.720]   OK.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.160]   So what are the APIs?
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.760]   So Google has more location information
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.560]   about people than anybody, much more so than any of these.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.400]   If you go to the Google credit blog,
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.440]   they have a list of a bunch of announcements.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.520]   And one of those is the latitude one.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.560]   We've got the mobile.blogspot.com.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.480]   Google code.plot.com.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.760]   I'm a global.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.960]   Man, fragmented much.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.160]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.160]   They've also announced a Buzz API.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.440]   When did that happen?
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.400]   Whoa.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.160]   That's the thing.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.720]   They're peering these things out.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.800]   Because I wanted to see some more Buzz stuff.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.480]   Well, that was the talks we're going on.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.520]   Oh, there we go.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.520]   The talks we're talking about.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.600]   Yeah, there's a whole social track.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.560]   Excellent.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.360]   That's good.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.560]   Let's have a look.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.840]   So now we're going to read this API in the middle of the show.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.320]   But with the new Google Latitude API,
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.080]   Bill needs to read a website to you now.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.760]   Build Latitude and Location into your app.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.320]   That's very interesting.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.000]   Right.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.480]   So the previous Latitude API was very naive.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.680]   It didn't actually have any auth in it.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.120]   So you had to say, I will publish my location to the whole web.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.280]   And then there was a way to do that.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.320]   It was very frustrating.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.640]   And so they've added one that actually has more auth in it
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.840]   now, which could make it more useful.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.320]   Again, I'm not sure how many of you are actually using Latitude.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.880]   I know I still use it now.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.720]   It's 3 million people use it because it happens without your knowledge.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.000]   And you forget that you turned it on.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.320]   Which has some issues right there.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   You totally don't.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.560]   I mean, I've got it runs.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.240]   And you know, if, for instance, if--
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.520]   Yeah, no, I can see you on it.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.840]   But I can't see anyone else on there.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.080]   Yeah, you're the only person I--
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.120]   I can see.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.480]   No, but you can easily accidentally turn it on or turn it on
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.680]   and forget that you've turned it on.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.280]   Although they do, I guess, occasionally remind you.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.200]   If you go to redeye.firstround.com, Charlie O'Donnell, who's
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.600]   a VC friend of mine, said that his view,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.200]   rather than having dozens of applications,
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.160]   each ask for your location.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.800]   Google Latitude, ask your permission,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.520]   and then puts it in the cloud.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.760]   And then anybody can access it.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.320]   Use it.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.320]   Right.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.280]   Right.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.640]   So we said, imagine linking your ATM or credit card
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.000]   to Google Latitude, you want to make a big withdrawal
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.400]   or charge them in, big, your bank can check what Google Latitude
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.880]   and say, are you in the same place as your card?
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.280]   That's not a great use case for me.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.760]   I agree with you, my group.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.400]   If Fire Eagle was that.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.920]   And that was the whole point of Fire Eagle.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   I had a better--
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.440]   I had a better location.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.600]   I mean, the greater Fire Eagle just left this week, right?
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.680]   Tom has left, yes.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.960]   But Fire Eagle carries on.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.040]   Yes.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.840]   Did you see that a tech entrider said he has proof
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.800]   that Google TV will make its debut tomorrow?
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.840]   I saw that.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.360]   Because on the press site, someone had written,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.840]   insert TV press release here on a rogue page.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.760]   That's what makes so comfortable.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.040]   This is what I love about Google, right?
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.000]   Didn't read right web, kind of tracked down a YouTube video
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.560]   that they had uploaded sort of early.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.520]   And they were like, oh, my gosh.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.760]   Google's going to make this announcement.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.720]   And Google was like, yep.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.240]   Whoops.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.440]   Here's it.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.400]   We uploaded it a little early.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.560]   Apple loses phones and bars, and it's a whole big thing.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.600]   But Google accidentally leaks some information.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.480]   And they're like, yep, you'll hear about that this week.
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:58.840]   Here's--
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.240]   But that's the quote.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   Because if you're selling hardware,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.560]   people will stop buying the current one.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.600]   You lose money.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   Right.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.120]   That's true.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:05.120]   That's true.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:05.600]   That's true.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.120]   That's true.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.600]   That's true.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   I'm going to dribble it out.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.520]   So this is interesting.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.560]   I don't know if this is new, but here's a site BuzzZ--
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.440]   B-U-Z-Z-Z--
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.160]   Z-Y.com.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.280]   That's a Buzz Search, which was something that was oddly enough
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.680]   missing from Buzz, even though Google's in the Search
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.160]   Business.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.720]   And a third party has implemented it.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.440]   I'm glad to see that in terms of popular searches,
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.480]   Robert Scobel and I are right there on the front page.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   But--
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.000]   Sweet.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.160]   --one of fine Scobel.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.240]   Would that be found by him?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.000]   Yeah, search for him, but don't let him see you.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.480]   Don't let him see you coming.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.560]   So that's-- the API is, I think, enhanced it looks like.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.720]   And they've got a number of new partners,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.480]   including Boxy and Plancast, Meebo, Seismic,
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.920]   TweetDeck.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.440]   One of the things that's been lacking with Buzz
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.960]   is third party applications.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.640]   Be great if you could add-- wouldn't you like that, Gina?
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.000]   If you could add Buzz to your TweetDeck?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.360]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.760]   Get it out of Gmail, and I'm happier.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.960]   Yes.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.200]   The whole Gmail connection was just nonsensical,
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.400]   as it turns out.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.680]   Looks like they have an OAuth setup for doing that.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.640]   This gives--
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.600]   if you're safe, you're low-weekly mirror looking at this.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   You're saying, oh, good.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.880]   Maybe I have some hope after Twitter.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.040]   Somewhere else to be.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.360]   This is a great opportunity.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.960]   Seismic and Ping FM are in the rest of already built apps.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.120]   So yeah, definitely.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:28.960]   Right.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.240]   And a great opportunity for them.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.040]   So they've been obviously previewing this API
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.280]   to other people in this.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.240]   So the model-- I mean, the API is
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.160]   that the open standard stuff that we've
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.600]   been talking about for a while.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.100]   Sure.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.440]   Activity streams and--
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.640]   Activity streams, Adam Pub/Sub/Sub/Sub/Sub/Sub/Sub/Sub.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.360]   But that stuff wasn't yet implemented
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.480]   in the original Buzz API.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:49.980]   No.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.800]   It wasn't quite--
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.960]   It just hinted at.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.800]   It was hinted at.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.760]   It was implied that there were some little bits of it,
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.800]   but there wasn't really API endpoints.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.480]   So now they've got proper read/write support.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.680]   That's really great.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:02.880]   Good.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.920]   Maybe Buzz will rise up from second-class citizen.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.440]   Although I just--
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.280]   But also, I mean, the other thing is--
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.000]   for me, the stronger thing is this same part of coming up
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.120]   with standards that lots of people can implement.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.560]   The point in Activity Streams work that a bunch of us
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.520]   have been involved with is to try and say, OK,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.640]   there's a whole bunch of stuff that's really similar here.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.240]   Why don't we agree on the names for it
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   so that we can move it between science more easily?
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.040]   So Buzz doing that should hopefully
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:28.920]   weight people up to this.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.600]   At the moment, Microsoft's already
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.440]   shipped some great support for it.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.520]   Facebook is doing Activity Stream support.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   My space is doing Activity Stream support.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.560]   But for Google to say, yes, this is how you do it with Buzz.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.480]   That may weight people up to and actually get them to say, OK,
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.840]   that's big enough that we'll spend some time on it.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.040]   There was some other Google News this week.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.360]   Google bought global IP solutions for a VoIP codec.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.840]   You're in the VoIP business, Kevin.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.600]   I'm going to have to go to you again for our codec explanation.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.480]   What do they gain with global IP solutions?
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.920]   Certainly the exact details of it.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   But broadly, it's they've got existing technology
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.040]   for doing audio-video codecs.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.440]   So there are basically different domains for video.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.600]   I sort of divide it into three.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.080]   There's I'm playing back pre-recorded video.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.800]   So that's the domain that VPA and H264
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.840]   or those ones are in there.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.040]   Their primary thing is I'm encoding this file once
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.200]   and then distributing the file.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.400]   Lots of people watch the file.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.560]   So that's YouTube.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.160]   That's DVDs, Netflix, those kinds of applications.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.800]   The second case is the kind of thing
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.960]   we're doing now for the people watching, where we're all
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.200]   all the I/O stream this morning, where there's something
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.240]   like 15 seconds buffering.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.720]   So it doesn't matter to some extent how long it takes
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.360]   to encode.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.080]   You can add some delay there, a small amount of delay.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.760]   And then the third case is when you're actually
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.440]   having a two-way conversation, like we're
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.760]   having over Skype, or when you're having a cell phone
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.680]   conversation, and there the amount of time it takes to encode
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.680]   and transmit becomes very significant.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.520]   Because if that gets above about half a second,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   it makes the conversation really hard.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.240]   Right.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.400]   So the difference between the VP8 guys
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.360]   is they were in the first domain.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.960]   And the codecs and the VoIP stuff is in the third domain.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.600]   Late and C is the key.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.920]   So it's sort of a latency focus.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.760]   And there's different--
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.320]   And GIPG IPS does a good job of this?
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.240]   But yes, there's something that lots of people
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.200]   have been using for a while.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.560]   So it's a sensible buy for them.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.040]   Yahoo, AOL, WebEx, Lotus Conferencing, I'll use it.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.320]   I'm going to save one other Google I/O announcement
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.000]   so that Gina can do it in her tip.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.120]   Just want you to know.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.440]   I didn't forget you, Gina.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.320]   Was there--
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.880]   Was there other Google I/O stuff that--
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.720]   I want to say that I'm delighted that Sports Illustrated,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.760]   which had this deal of frages about, oh,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.120]   the wonders in the tablet.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.240]   What we can do in the tablet?
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.280]   God bless him.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.480]   I've always said they could do the same thing on the web.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.320]   And indeed, they demonstrated that HTML5 will do all the
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.760]   wonders of tablet stuff.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.520]   And they seemed equally as excited as Rupert Murdoch is.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.040]   And everybody else about the iPad.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.720]   It's great just watching these old content guys.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.040]   And he made a few sports jokes that the Googlers just went--
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:22.520]   huh?
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.480]   Baseball, Shaq?
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.520]   I don't know.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.240]   I've never heard-- you could have heard a pin drop in that room.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.600]   And the poor guy, because I could tell that he thought--
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   he expected these were big applause lines and--
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.360]   And nothing.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.800]   Yeah, I felt that for him.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   He's so poor.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.960]   It went over my head that I had missed the sports joke.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.320]   So I didn't know what was going on.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.280]   But I was like, why is he so kind of stuttering?
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.120]   And he seems kind of awkward.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   Like, if he got a little more awkward, I think he realized
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.160]   that he was not among sports fans.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.000]   He's a real man in a room filled with--
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.720]   With--
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.000]   --aasty face geeks.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.200]   Aasty face geeks.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.000]   I mean, I'll go to baseball games.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.360]   The sun is there.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.400]   That fiery ball in the sky.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.240]   I hate it.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.400]   Terry's reputation has always been that--
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.320]   as part of my son a long time ago-- that he hunts for his
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.920]   lunch.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.560]   He hunts for lunch.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.680]   Wow.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.880]   He's a real sportsman.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   Apparently, Google is going to do a vault application for
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.560]   OnStar.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.440]   I can't figure out if it's an Android--
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.520]   because there is an iPhone vault application for the
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.880]   Chevy Vault, because I played with it that you could turn
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.040]   on your car from your iPhone.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.560]   I presume the Android will get that.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.280]   But I'm wondering if Android will actually be in the car.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.840]   It sounds like they're going to--
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.840]   You'll be able to send--
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.760]   --so that you can tell your car before you get to it, where
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.200]   you're going.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.960]   So it sounds like there's some competition for Microsoft's
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.880]   auto stuff, the Ford Sync stuff.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.000]   Well, this makes sense.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   It was inevitable.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.840]   I had a rental car that had a GPS in it the other week, and
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   it was like, this is really annoying.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.800]   The graphics are like 10 years old, and I've got a
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.560]   Tranturn, this little note thing, and use it.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.480]   I end up picking up the droid and just sticking it on top
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.960]   of the screen in the car and using this instead, because
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.200]   actually it does the namthing much better.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.880]   I'm talking to somebody yesterday who still uses his iPhone.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.920]   He uses his Nexus 1 only as a GPS now.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.000]   It's a good GPS?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.560]   It's very good GPS.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.640]   Well, except that-- yeah, is it really a good GPS if you
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.560]   talk to it?
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.080]   If you actually have to try and type something into it, you
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.400]   better park.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.040]   Impossible.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.720]   The in-car ones have all this stuff that comes up and
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   says, do not use this while moving and actually lock you
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.520]   out while you're moving.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.760]   Someone is going to kill themselves trying to change
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.560]   nav on an X-S.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.800]   Everybody needs a navigator as well as a driver.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.680]   That's all I'd say.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.640]   Somebody in the second seat.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.480]   I call shotgun and phone.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   Yeah, shotgun and phone.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.040]   That's exactly right.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.000]   But I think that's interesting.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.280]   The vault's going to be an interesting car.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.600]   It comes out this fall.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.320]   The electric car has a small gas engine to keep it charged.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.880]   And I drove one at South by Southwest, and they had an
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.000]   iPhone app that let you turn on the car from the house, and
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.680]   all sorts of stuff.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.440]   And I think there will be an Android app to do that.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.040]   But it sounds like there will be Android in the on-star, which
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.560]   is very intriguing.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.520]   A real opportunity for Google, since they can give away the
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.920]   operating system, and some even pointed out that with a
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.760]   freemium model, they could pay people like Chevrolet to use
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.480]   it.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.040]   Pay General Motors to use it.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.280]   Kindle for Android is on the way.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.000]   Amazon is--
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:27.920]   Yay.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.400]   Announced it.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.880]   Not only will they make a Kindle app for Android, but you'll
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.520]   be able to buy from within the app.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.320]   Amazing.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.240]   Yay.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.560]   Crazy idea.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.000]   Speaking of Android apps, really important for me is the
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.800]   New York Times now has its Android app out.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.320]   Oh, I have to download it right now.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.120]   No fan affair whatsoever.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.080]   It looks a little bit different.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.520]   But that's really that.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.720]   And my phone number, the last two reasons I could be using
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.520]   the iPhone.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.760]   Well, I tell you, NPD's numbers that the Android
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.520]   handsets outsold the iPhone in the last quarter, hugely
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.320]   up worldwide even.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.800]   Android is really on a roll in terms of the handsets.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.840]   And partly it's because of so many good--
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.400]   it's not just one.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.000]   It's not just the Nexus one or the Droid.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.440]   It's also the incredible.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.520]   And the Evo from Sprint's coming out June 4 now.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.200]   And that also is an HTC handset based on Android.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.320]   One of the Android developer sessions is how to develop for
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.240]   multiple versions across multiple handsets just like
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240]   dealing with that expectation.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   There are screens.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.720]   I mean, the Evo is a 4.3 inch screen.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.200]   So it's a--
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.040]   And you've got the Dell 5 inch now, I think, announced for June.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.920]   All right.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.440]   And I think it's just a matter of time before there's
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.520]   Android tablets.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.600]   There's already some in the--
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.280]   Well, the German one is now for sale at the--
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.120]   They changed the name from the Wii pad.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:47.840]   What's it called now?
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.800]   It's not the Wii pad.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.280]   A Mi-Tab.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.400]   Mi-Tab, OK.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.840]   Wait for the Wii pad to the Mi-Tab?
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.320]   OK.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.720]   I guess the Wii pad did sound--
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.960]   So I guess I have a copy.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.440]   I just need to say that you hear Bill Mar's joke about the pad brand.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.280]   No, what do you say?
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.240]   I hope I get to over-say this.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:08.880]   It was Bill Mar.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.720]   He said that he was making fun of Obama for acting like he's just--
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.840]   I don't do technology stuff.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.440]   And then he said the point that McCain is that much more so.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.160]   And it's really not so.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.720]   And he thinks the Xbox is something you put on--
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.840]   sorry, the iPad is something you put on your Xbox.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.200]   It's all right.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.440]   Oh, dear.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.000]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.560]   I had to think about that for a moment.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.720]   I'm not up.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.240]   Oh, the--
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.760]   Apparently, Google's-- we're just going to change the subject now.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:42.240]   Apparently, Google is no longer going to sell the Nexus 1 online.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.760]   And I don't think anybody's going to sell it in the store.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.080]   So I think that Nexus 1 may be headed for the junkie.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   I was sad and went into Zn.io immediately about that announcement.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.440]   Because I really liked the Nexus 1.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.160]   I didn't really know what that meant.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.600]   I mean, it sounded like they were saying,
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.920]   the web store didn't really work out.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.320]   We got early adopters, but not really anyone else.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.080]   But does that mean that--
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.440]   Is the phone worked, but the store didn't work?
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.000]   The phone works--
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.080]   People want to touch it.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.720]   But they didn't know now.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.560]   Here's the problem--
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.640]   The TV room is going to have it in the store.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.640]   It's only T-Mobile because Sprint says we're not going to do it.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.040]   Verizon says we're not going to do it.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.320]   So it's only going to be T-Mobile.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.800]   AT&T only does it for retail no subsidy.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.880]   I think that this phone is sad to say,
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.080]   but it's going to be eclipsed by the incredible, which
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.600]   is this phone better, and the EVO.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.360]   And maybe they had Motorola Droid, which everybody now
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.040]   who went to Google I/O has one of.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.880]   You were saying, Gina, that there were a lot of in the audience.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.320]   You could hear "droid."
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   It's people putting them up.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:37.960]   We'll put it up.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.320]   "Droid."
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.600]   They're all around you.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.440]   "Droid."
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.720]   I still do not understand what Motorola was saying.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.840]   It's an anti-toy story.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.560]   "Droid."
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.600]   What did they make?
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.040]   Why did they make it so scary?
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.120]   The ads are still scary.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.160]   My friend was telling me that in his three-year-old daughter.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.720]   He was like, "Daddy, why is this scary robot punching the screen
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.440]   again when the commercial comes on?"
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.560]   It's horrible.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.240]   It's the red eye of Sauron.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.200]   I don't understand it.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.200]   Right, the red eye when you boot it up.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.800]   And the iPhone commercials were like,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   "Happy humans and shiny sunlit places."
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.560]   Like having great lives.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.200]   And the Droid commercial is like this dark, rainy, stormy robot.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:15.960]   And--
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.240]   It's for the gadget guys.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:18.760]   That's true.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.440]   It is.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.960]   It's dumb, because you know what--
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   I'm not saying it isn't dumb, but it's not as dumb
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   as those pre-ends with this scary, not quite human woman.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.000]   I think it's right there, though.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.200]   And you saw what it did to the pre, I just want to say.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.040]   Mm.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.360]   But apparently they have lots of extra ones,
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.000]   because they give them away pretty.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.560]   The drop for that.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.880]   A few extra pre's lying around.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.560]   One last story, then we'll get to our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   Google had to admit, right when Facebook was getting all this privacy issue.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.480]   And we talked a lot about-- in fact, we talked almost exclusively
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.680]   about Facebook last week.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.400]   Notice not one mention this week.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.520]   Google admits that the roving vans it was using to collect street view
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.640]   information and Wi-Fi data, all of which-- you know, like Skyhook,
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.840]   all of which was kind of kosher.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.160]   It had some old code in there, which was also saving data.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.480]   Yeah, this is a pretty serious issue.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.680]   I got some email from listeners who were like, well, do you trust them now?
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.200]   And which I thought was a reasonable thing to ask,
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.520]   because we've been talking about trust in Facebook.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.320]   Maybe I'm just a total on a apologetic fan girl.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.440]   But it's like that blog post was like, we made a mistake.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.520]   Here's how it happened.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.760]   We failed badly.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.400]   We're really sorry.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.240]   We're separating the data.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.120]   We're deleting the data.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.080]   We're figuring out the best ways to do that and not do this again.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.880]   I mean, they posted it-- it was late on us Friday night, right?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.240]   Or Friday afternoon.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.400]   So it was Friday night, Eastern time.
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.160]   I mean, it was a big mistake.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.480]   But I felt like they treated it with the right kind of tone.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.360]   And I think that they were pretty transparent about it.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.640]   It was a PR disaster.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.320]   In that sense.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.840]   But in terms of reality, the thing is-- all the conspiracy theorists,
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.000]   especially in Germany, come out like crazy now.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.040]   And I say, try to tell me what the business benefit is of a random,
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.200]   occasional bit of data from browsing on one moment in time,
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.240]   on one street in Hamburg.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.120]   Yep.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.600]   It's true.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.520]   What can you possibly do with that?
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.240]   I know people kept their headlines mistakenly
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:22.960]   with quotes around it.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.280]   It's like, what would they have done with that data have been to them?
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.040]   I mean, these cars were driving down the street.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.120]   They were maybe stopped at all.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.880]   They were not only driving, but they were changing channels.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.680]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.400]   Yeah, changing channels several times per second or per minute, right?
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.320]   Nothing.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.360]   I just saw some coverage at Spiegel in German.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.840]   I'll spare you the link, along with any future jokes.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.280]   And they finally got some sanity about it.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.680]   They finally said, listen, there have been earlier reports
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.920]   that Google is lasering buildings to get the dimensions.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.240]   There have been earlier reports that Google was doing,
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.400]   what's got Hook was doing, what can they really do with this?
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.520]   It was the first same coverage I've seen in a long time
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.160]   about Google in Germany.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.040]   But now there's a criminal investigation going on about this.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.120]   I was going to say I thought Google over apologized,
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.440]   but you can't over apologize in a climate in which now you're
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.720]   getting investigated criminally.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.800]   Here's the irony to me, is that you fear government getting data,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.200]   and now government is going to Google saying, give us the data.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.320]   Well, let's give it to everybody.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:28.560]   Right.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.120]   Back from Ottawa, one thing that shocked me there
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.680]   that I learned there is that the Canadians, I'm told,
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.480]   I asked some people about this and said, oh, yeah, that's what it is.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.280]   Their major fear about privacy, about privacy rather right now,
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.480]   is the Patriot Act.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.120]   And they don't trust the cloud in Canada because of what can be done,
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.200]   what Americans can do worse to Canadian,
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.720]   they don't Canadian soil, even than American soil.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.000]   And so there's this paranoia about privacy and the cloud going on.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.520]   So it's us, they fear.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.960]   This is the sort of weird thing about the EU,
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:10.080]   because the EU has data retention laws that says ISPs have to keep
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.720]   information for six months that identifies your internet traffic,
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.960]   so the government can snoop through it later.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.040]   And then there's a thing about Google putting the odd packet here and there.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.960]   So I'm hoping the Germans will be consistent about this
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.480]   and help vote down the data retention laws that August campaigning in the UK.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.560]   The other bit for me is this.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.360]   In 2005, I think it was, I'm doing research on my next book,
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.400]   the government was going to demand that Google hold on to all Gmail data
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.920]   and Google threatened to pull Gmail out of Germany and not do it there.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.680]   And you think that the German government would understand that,
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.320]   this is not the best thing for the government there to be doing.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.640]   And they were deaf to the irony of it.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.400]   Well, this is the same thing as the UK,
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.760]   where they have video cameras on every street corner that is being recorded
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.200]   and you've no idea where it's going,
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.720]   but they all got upset about Google Street
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.280]   and you're driving around and publishing it on the web
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.040]   because they could see the results.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.640]   And there's some very odd stuff there.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.320]   The thing that I didn't like about the Google's announcement on that was
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.280]   Alan Eustis basically saying,
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.320]   "Oh, you should secure your Wi-Fi networks anyway,"
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.240]   which is like, no, that isn't the right answer,
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.880]   because the internet in general,
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.240]   anyone who's transferring packets,
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.600]   and that can be anyone because the way routing works,
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.560]   gets to see the contents of them.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.440]   So Wi-Fi is not some sort of magic edge case here.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.160]   Actually, the whole of the internet is like that.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.560]   And if you really care about security,
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.280]   you want to encrypt the channel that you're sending it over,
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.360]   you want to use HTTPS or you want to use PGP or something like that,
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.840]   you don't want to say, "Oh, I'm going to do some boundary security,"
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.800]   and then just root this over the internet anyway,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.280]   and guess what, AT&T is sniffing every packet that passes through.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.640]   So there is this issue of,
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.520]   you know, understanding where the security problems in this stuff lie,
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.600]   but it all ends up being very obfuscated.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.480]   And I am worried that there seems to be this campaign that says,
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.600]   "Having an open Wi-Fi network is a terrible sin against society now,"
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600]   as opposed to providing a public benefit,
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   which seems very odd to me.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.640]   Let's hear from phone.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.760]   Leo explained to me what's,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.200]   because you said before in the show,
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.760]   but it just could be ammunition when this discussion comes up.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.360]   So from my future reference,
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.840]   what does Skyhook do with that data? Why is it beneficial to gather that?
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.000]   Oh, it's really useful. A lot of companies,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.320]   I think, I don't know if Apple uses the Skyhook data,
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.280]   but a lot of companies use the data so that when you're on Wi-Fi,
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.120]   but you don't have a GPS as in the first-generation iPad,
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.880]   it can identify where you are.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.160]   What Skyhook does, what Google was doing is,
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.640]   as they go through mapping GPS coordinates,
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.520]   they also map SSIDs and MAC addresses of access points.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.760]   Now, this stuff is being broadcasted to the air anyway.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.120]   It does it for both encrypted and unencrypted access points,
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.360]   because it's going through the air anyway.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.800]   And by collecting that information,
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.360]   they can then say when you see an access point on a Wi-Fi-enabled device,
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.800]   "Oh, you're 100 meters from this and you're 20 meters from this,
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   you must be here," and they could do a pretty good job.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.720]   So that's why, if you had an early iPad,
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.520]   you could actually use Google Maps because of Skyhook.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.560]   And it made sense for Google to collect that information.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.640]   I hope they don't stop collecting that information.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.440]   They did in Germany.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.040]   Yeah, they had to.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.400]   They said they're stopping future, yeah.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.080]   In Germany, but they've got geoIP guessing anyway.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.280]   This just makes them more accurate.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.760]   I mean, Google has been guessing where you are based on your IP
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   and getting it embarrassing you wrong sometimes.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.480]   Yeah, because your IP address alone is not very granular.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.600]   It's through your internet service provider,
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.360]   so if I use Comcast, it might get it within 100 miles.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.000]   It's not very useful.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.320]   It depends on your proxy and weird things.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.440]   But they had this thing where they...
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.400]   The thing is they were using it in this weird way,
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.800]   where they would then default you into a different Google front end,
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.200]   which means that if you're American, you went to Paris,
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.440]   they decided you wanted it Google in French, which is like...
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:04.920]   That's right.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.680]   You'll slightly missing the point here.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.280]   Geography is not destiny.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.960]   I'd like to find out about this.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.920]   But I don't actually want you to give me the results in French.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.120]   That's a good point.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.160]   No, that happened to me in China all of a sudden.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.800]   Now in French, I could at least figure out how to get the English page.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.000]   In China, I was lost.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.520]   I guess I won't be using Google today.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.680]   Anyway, any other...
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.320]   It seems like...
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.200]   Go ahead.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.840]   I was going to say, when I realized that they were doing that,
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.680]   like collecting SSIDs for location awareness for Wi-Fi devices,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.800]   it just seems like...
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.520]   I don't know.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.560]   The images, the street view images by my home are so old.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.840]   I mean, don't SSIDs...
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.960]   I mean, don't access points move so often and come up and go down.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.920]   It just seemed like...
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.960]   It's surprising that the results that they get are as good as they are,
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.760]   because I imagine that that data changes so much, much more than...
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.040]   If you have more than one, you're in pretty good shape,
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:58.520]   but you're right.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.920]   Occasionally, you'll be positioned out in the ocean or something.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.480]   But if you have a couple or more,
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.720]   in any urban area, you're going to have many more.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.680]   Plus, you can see history...
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.880]   So you can triangulate.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.200]   Exactly.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.480]   You can do a very good job.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.840]   And if you ever use a Wi-Fi-only device,
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.720]   and it knows where you are, it's kind of spooky, to be honest with you.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.600]   Well, I mean, if I popped up in my MacBook and just started...
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.000]   I mean, Firefox and Chrome, they all have location.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.200]   And they know where you are.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:22.920]   And that's why.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.720]   That's how they do it.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.360]   I think probably the Feed API,
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.200]   which I kind of mentioned quickly earlier,
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.720]   is probably worth mentioning,
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.240]   because it's based on Pub/Sub/Hubbub,
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.000]   which we talked about several episodes ago, a long time ago.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.200]   This is the video that Read My Web had seen before it got announced.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.120]   But there's this new Feed API,
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.320]   or this Feed API upgrade,
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.880]   that they announced today that lets developers and bed feeds on their websites,
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.480]   and they get pushed.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.000]   They get updated automatically.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.720]   And so new Feed item show up without refreshing them paid.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.360]   That's very cool.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.240]   I really like that.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:54.840]   Really sweet.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.920]   So you get a little taste of real time,
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.680]   very easily.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.040]   And it's literally just like,
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.360]   whatever, five, six lines of JavaScript.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.320]   We just move closer and closer to this notion that everything's real time,
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.120]   that the idea of a static web page is just meaningless,
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.800]   that everything is updating all the time.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.400]   And I think that's great.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.800]   That's how I like to consume content.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.080]   It's the future of news, folks.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:15.560]   Sure.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:15.960]   Absolutely.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.000]   It's the future of communication.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.880]   Everything's a ticker.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.760]   It's what Marissa Meyer has been saying.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.680]   I got crap in the chat room for saying it too often for a while,
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.120]   but it's the hyper-personal news stream.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:26.840]   Right.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.800]   That's all your stuff.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.080]   Where is that API genome?
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.200]   It's on the Google-- the Ajax APIs blog.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.000]   Of course.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.120]   Google Ajax search api.blogspot.com.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.000]   I love it.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.680]   No, I didn't.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.080]   No, I did.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.120]   Google had so many blogs.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.400]   That's something that's available for blogs.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.280]   It's a blog code as well.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.520]   So if you go to Google code.blogspot.com,
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.880]   the buzz stuff is linked from there.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.760]   That's it.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.240]   OK.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:49.240]   That's it.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.760]   It's the buzz the same as the API.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.120]   I mean, the--
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.000]   The feed API.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.400]   The feed API.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.760]   Is that the same API?
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:55.400]   Yeah, it didn't--
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.120]   No, the feed API.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.000]   Feed is different.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.880]   Go to dot google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.240]   Yeah, you're not going to type that in, right?
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:03.800]   That's OK.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.440]   Just Google feed API and you'll--
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.520]   You get the idea.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.720]   So this could feed--
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.880]   This enables me to put any content to feed it out to sites all around, right?
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.080]   What it--
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.040]   It is--
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.040]   Yeah, it kind of--
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.880]   RSS or atom feeds you've already got,
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.800]   except that this means that when they change,
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.680]   your sign can change--
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.160]   Right.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   So--
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.280]   And it will work with any atom or RSS feed.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.840]   I mean, do I have to have a special kind of feed?
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.480]   Any feed.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.280]   Any feed.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:30.680]   Yep.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.240]   Any feed.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.840]   Here's what I've always wanted.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.400]   Not always.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.760]   Last two years I wanted.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.120]   Is that when I post blog post,
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:42.920]   I want people who link to it to be able to basically subscribe to any corrections that I make.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.200]   Is this getting there?
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:46.760]   No.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.240]   Ah, OK.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.400]   You can have a corrections feed.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:51.720]   And--
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.000]   But then they'd have to at their end, they'd have to subscribe to it using the API.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.760]   That's tricky, because that's a merge case.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.320]   So the problem--
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.560]   We--
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.280]   We had--
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.720]   You know, I had this with technology,
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.640]   where people would complain they were seeing the same post twice,
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   and that's because someone had corrected the type of it.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.600]   So there's upsides and downsides to that.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.960]   What happens--
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.560]   Create a corrections feed.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.520]   But there's like a small thing where I'm correcting a transpose letter,
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.120]   and then there's an update that's got--
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:20.680]   Right.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.280]   Oh, damn.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.200]   I actually got something badly wrong here.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.160]   Here's my correction.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:25.960]   Here's my retraction.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.360]   So there's nuances to how you do that.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.760]   Now, if it's actually just modifying the thing that next time you view it, that's OK.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.760]   But the--
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.120]   Buzz had this problem where everything would then propagate back to the top again,
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.240]   and then it gets annoying.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.400]   And Wave has a bit of that too, doesn't it, Gina?
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:46.120]   Where every tiny edit pulls you back up to the top,
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.880]   and suddenly it's like, I've read this thing three times,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.320]   where are you-- what are you on about?
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:49.800]   Yes.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:55.720]   And you have at least hit the space key to sort of go through and see where the change was.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.360]   But if there's lots of them, it's not that helpful.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.000]   Right.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.760]   I want to-- what are you on about button?
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.280]   Instead of Mark Allers' rep, what are you on about?
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.480]   I always thought every web page should have a huh button,
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.320]   and you click that and explains what the hell's going on.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.560]   We actually implement that at Twit.tv, but it did not become a stance.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.840]   No, actually, we are new.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.400]   We're doing a redesign, and one of the things that we're doing in the redesign
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.680]   is making everything real-time.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.840]   So there'll be streaming text.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.960]   And this actually makes it very much easier for us to create widgets that will update in real-time
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.240]   on the web page.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:29.800]   So it's good.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.480]   They also announced a font API.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.440]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:39.400]   There already is in a CSS tag that allows you to use real fonts.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:46.600]   I'm not sure if this is the CSS3 font face standard, or if this is something different,
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.480]   but they're going to support--
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.000]   Well, it is based on that.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:49.720]   OK, good.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.080]   Because I don't think we need another one.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:58.200]   So the point of this is there is that, but it's very hard to actually get hold of fonts,
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.000]   because embedding fonts on the web is difficult.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.920]   And there's Jeff Veen's startup that's been doing this for a while--
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:05.400]   Typekit.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.680]   --of finding ways to license this.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:06.840]   Right.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:12.040]   And what this is is, here's a bunch of fonts that are in the public domain that you can use across the web.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.360]   And you can count on Google servers being there.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.480]   And Google cells will keep them up.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.360]   And I assume they're going to let other PD fonts be submitted to this and host them as well.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.240]   Oh, this is great.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.040]   So these are all great.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.720]   So these are ways of getting into them that way.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.280]   But they've got the Droid fonts, and they've got a series of really nice looking,
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.000]   and a seraphy ones there.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.120]   And obviously, it's not as rich as half and crew.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.160]   What's the name of--
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.280]   Did a typekit?
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.240]   Typekit something like that.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:37.560]   Typekit.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.440]   Yeah, typekit.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:45.160]   Typekit is a much more ambitious effort for this that's designed to work with the families
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.600]   and that you license them.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.160]   And I know that they work together to get this working.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.040]   So that's good.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:50.760]   It means that we should--
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.560]   I'm glad it's support.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.000]   It's a standard.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.480]   That's great.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   It's like, did you see the script stuff?
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.640]   No, what did Scrib do?
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:04.280]   Scribs announcement was that they will convert your documents into HTML5 now,
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.040]   and they will embed them with the real fonts.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:06.840]   Whoa!
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.000]   Lovely.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:09.880]   If you see that.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.160]   See, that's basically--
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.920]   they've gone from being an embedded weird thing to you upload a document,
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.080]   and they munch it and give you an HTML5 document.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.000]   They link to the real fonts and make those work as well.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.440]   So it suddenly becomes--
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.000]   all the type is selectable in these complicated documents.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:27.560]   So even the--
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.360]   Let me guess this.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.480]   If this is the beginning of a new open word processing standard.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.560]   Which one is HTML5?
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.320]   Yeah, right.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.760]   This then carries that on.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.280]   I hope that Google Docs will stick with that,
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.480]   because Google Docs started out being our format as HTML,
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.880]   and it's twisted a little bit since then.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.240]   I hope they're going to sort of realize that this is the right answer.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.920]   I think they're smart enough to do that.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.600]   So this is neat.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.280]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:59.320]   We're starting to see that this stuff,
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.720]   the sports illustrated thing that the guy showed,
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.720]   although slightly cheesy, was basically saying,
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.360]   we can do this rich complicated, beautiful stuff in HTML5.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   Now we're not having to render it in weird ways.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.920]   And the--
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.280]   Kevin Lynch showing off Dreamweaver and saying,
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.400]   we're publishing HTML5 properly now,
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.760]   and giving you tools to edit that.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.360]   This is all encouraging, because we're seeing the tools catch up
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.880]   to the technology, which is nice.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.360]   The script stuff is really nice,
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.600]   because they've done a really nice job of,
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.720]   you upload your document,
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.120]   and they work out the complicated
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.560]   weirdness of turning it into a nice web page.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.040]   Wow, that's really neat.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.480]   Yeah, very useful.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.680]   What an interesting way to publish now.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.800]   Does this maybe kill the PDF someday?
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.360]   Oh, god.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.160]   That's a wonderful--
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:49.960]   That's a wonderful--
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:50.200]   I hope so.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.800]   Oh, it won't be a really good haters today.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.520]   No.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.480]   We want to put you on a business, Adobe.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.400]   PDF is a print-oriented format, really.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.080]   It's a fidelity-oriented format,
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.920]   but it's PostScript, which means it's like,
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.760]   "I know, but I think this thing."
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.520]   Tell digital editors that.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.960]   Right, that's all they do, yeah.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.000]   That's an e-ego format.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.040]   I don't think that the--
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:21.160]   I think there are more capabilities in right now in PDF,
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.520]   but maybe not in the long run,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.640]   if HTML5 really develops along the lines it's going to,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.880]   you'd have animation, you'd have video,
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.680]   you'd have--
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.600]   and especially if there's tools to do the automatic
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.520]   conversion, like script.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.160]   That's the thing that Scripters has done,
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.920]   which is that they sat down, reimagine their product,
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.800]   and they said, "Okay, we're going to place the big bit
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.640]   on HTML5 as a document format."
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.040]   Brilliant.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.360]   I'm really impressed with that.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.400]   Very exciting.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.600]   Scripters--
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.880]   That has always been cool, but--
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.920]   I've got the back.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.240]   But if I published my newspaper using the API font fonts,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.720]   I could present things--
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.120]   I could produce and present things on the web
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.440]   and in paper at the same time, right?
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.240]   Yes.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:05.880]   Yes.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.160]   And then the other thing is that,
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.400]   you know, the four back words,
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.760]   which means if you look at it on a--
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.800]   It degrades gracefully.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.560]   It degrades gracefully and gives you a textual view.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.840]   So if you look at it on a pre-smartphone browser,
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.720]   you will see something there,
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.920]   because the HTML still makes sense.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.360]   They just won't read the new fonts.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.760]   I'm working with a guy named John Payton,
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.120]   a journal register company,
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.520]   which is an off-bank-ropped newspaper company
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.160]   that he's making go digital first print last.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.480]   And we sat talking about--
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.160]   He inherited this technology there,
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.120]   where he took over CEO,
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.000]   that I haven't heard this phrase in years.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.080]   He said, "Well, they still had VDTs."
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.600]   Remember that?
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.760]   Yes. Video display terminal.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.360]   Exactly. I had heard that in years.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.200]   So this is last I went to the doctor for.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.040]   That's-- Every newsroom had a VDT.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:54.360]   Right.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.000]   And so--
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:55.720]   If it was modern--
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.680]   [laughter]
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.800]   What he had to spend on this.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.440]   And I said, "You know, I think you can produce an entire newspaper
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.000]   using free tools and by God, he did it."
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.120]   Good for him.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.800]   And he used nothing but free tools
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.840]   up to the point of the press.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.360]   And he showed me last week the piece of paper he had in his hand
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.080]   that came off the press,
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.600]   and was produced by nothing but free tools.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.680]   Pretty cool.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.320]   Very nice.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.040]   Good for Scribs.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.160]   Because they really--
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.800]   Unfortunately, they were turning into a platform for piracy.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.040]   And there was real--
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:25.400]   And there were real issues about all of the trademark material that was on Scrib.
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.320]   This is a really good direction for them to go.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.160]   I think this is fantastic.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.880]   And a non-trivial thing to do as well.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:32.600]   No.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.680]   And it's putting down the marker for microsoftdocs.com and Google Docs.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.080]   Okay.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.520]   You know, this can be done.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:38.840]   Wow.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.720]   Well, it would be a simple thing to publish--
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.120]   It should be a simple thing to publish to
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.160]   HTML5.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.920]   Yes.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.640]   It's suddenly they've generated an HTML5 version that--
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.760]   That's what Office should do.
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.760]   That's what Office should publish to HTML5.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.280]   I wonder who wants to do the countdown clock.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.720]   How long before Google buys Scribs?
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.760]   Oh.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.040]   All right.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.240]   Hey, this has really been fun.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.480]   Let's get our tool, tip, and number of the week,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.160]   and we can go home.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.840]   But I think I can say safely now that I'm going to have to be back here at 8.30
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.560]   tomorrow morning.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.880]   Because it seems like they saved the best for tomorrow.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.080]   Looks that way.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:19.800]   8.30, man.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.080]   You'll be at the cottage, Leo?
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:23.640]   I'll be here.
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.440]   I'll be at the cottage.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.600]   You can come up if you want, but I think you're going to be going to the
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.400]   college.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.520]   I'm going to try to stay away from the decaf coffee.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.360]   You did it.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:38.360]   Gina and Adam Pash and Kevin and I were in a live wave during the I/O.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.160]   And that was fun.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.080]   We should do that again tomorrow, too.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.280]   Let's do it tomorrow again.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:42.920]   What do you say?
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.680]   And this time I'll have an icon because Dan on the wave team sent me a note saying,
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.480]   you know, you, you, but in the old days, it took the icon from your profile, right?
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.600]   Yeah, at some point it did.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.120]   And then that, and then that's changed.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.480]   Wave has changed a lot.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.160]   They changed my wave.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.600]   They keep changing that wave and moving target to write a book about that, for sure.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.720]   I think, yeah, good for you.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.440]   I figured it out and I have added a, an image.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:04.680]   Thank you.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.720]   Oh, excellent.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:10.600]   So, Gina, let's start with your tips since it's, I think, wave appropriate.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.280]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.960]   So my tip is really simple today.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.240]   Wave opened up to everyone.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.920]   So no one, you don't need an invite.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.360]   Just great.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.560]   You don't have to request an invite.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.680]   You don't have to ask friends.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.760]   You don't have to post on Twitter who has invites.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.840]   You don't have to wait some indefinite amount of time.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.960]   If you have a Google account, a vanilla Google account, you can sign, you can sign
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.320]   right in and have wave.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.320]   And if you do that, your wave address will be your username at GoogleWave.com.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.920]   Just map to your Gmail address.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.680]   If you are a Google Apps user and you have Google Apps for your domain, like I do,
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:45.480]   you can enable a wave on your domain and then you have your name at your domain.com
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:49.560]   will be your wave address, which is also really exciting because the wave team found that,
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.680]   wave really got used with groups of people who had kind of, you know,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.160]   groups of people trying to get things done, right?
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:00.280]   Not public chats or journalists or, you know, mostly that was the best use case.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.560]   There was a bunch of other cool wave announcements for developers.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.560]   They created a data API, which will make it really easy for people to make wave clients.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.280]   So I'm sure we're going to see an Android app, possibly an iPhone app, other good wave
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.760]   clients that work other than the website.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.800]   And you can build robots and host them on your own web server now.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.480]   You have to do it on App Engine.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.040]   They open source the rich text editor, which is really good.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.800]   So those are all really developer announcements.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.840]   My tip is just to enable wave on your Google Apps account or just sign in if you
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.360]   didn't never got an invite.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.760]   Wave.google.com. Is that all you have to do?
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.720]   Yeah, that's all you got to do.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:40.120]   And I am impressed with the number of new robots or widgets that they've added to Wave,
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.600]   which will, I think, make it a much more useful tool.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.680]   I think that's the kind of thing that they needed to do to really.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.680]   Yeah, there's a lot of really good ones.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.440]   You can export waves to Google Docs.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.800]   You can, you know, you've got that there's like a brainstorming back of napkin,
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.640]   sketching wave, there's video conferencing.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.440]   You know, the Ribbit, the Ribbit gadget is awesome.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.080]   So, so yeah, and they have the extensions, they have featured extensions in the sidebar now,
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.120]   so you can explore those.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.960]   So a lot has changed in Wave in the past few months.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.320]   So if you haven't logged in since, you know, a few months ago,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.840]   when people were talking about a lot more, you know, log back in and check it out.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.520]   And how much do you have to update the book, Gina?
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.040]   The book's changelog is getting lengthy.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.120]   Let's say that, but I'm handling it like a software product.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.040]   I have a changelog page on the website.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.560]   I tried to future proof the text and, you know, point it to the changelog.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.360]   So, so yeah, there's been quite a bit of editing and rewriting going on,
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.560]   on the wiki and the book.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.360]   And now I've been full because I've been saving my invitations,
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.480]   and I guess I didn't need to.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.800]   It's good though.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.600]   It'll be someday, it'll be like in the Google Museum.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.400]   You can say, just screenshot it, we're back when we're doing it.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.360]   Four-tune invitations.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.240]   I hope that's not your number, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   What is your, what is your number of?
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.000]   My number is 117%.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.720]   That was VIX slide today at the keynote that TechCrunch highlighted.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.560]   That's in four-ish, four-ish,
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:04.840]   says between 2004 and 2009 web usage increased 117%.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.200]   No surprise there.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.800]   The interesting thing is, is that listening to the radio is down 18%.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.800]   Reading newspapers is down 17%.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.720]   Reading magazines is down 6% and watching TV is zero growth.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.640]   Well, zero is better than nothing.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.640]   Zero is better than down.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.520]   I'm surprised it's down.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.320]   It's not zero.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.000]   I thought more people were watching more TV.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.720]   Ah, thoughts are too, but we're in a four-ish.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.600]   So, no great surprise here, obviously.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.600]   As my tweet on this was that like soldiers,
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.000]   the old ones don't die, they just fade away.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.320]   Right.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.760]   The old media just fades away.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.760]   My toy of the week, and it really is a toy,
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.680]   is for Google Reader users, it's called Play.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.680]   It's kind of a new way to look at Google Reader items.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.760]   And it's the kind of thing you might want to have
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.520]   just running on a machine in the background.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.240]   If you go to google.com/reader/play,
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:01.800]   it essentially creates a slideshow of your,
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.720]   with images of your Google Reader items.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.360]   And so, it's just a fun way to look at it.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.880]   You can still star them and like them and share them.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:17.160]   As you go, there's a few oddball controls over here on the side
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.080]   that you can take a look at and play with,
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080]   choose categories and so forth.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:21.880]   It's kind of fun.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.720]   That is really fun.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.080]   I'm getting some really good ones.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.720]   This is based on my subscriptions.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.000]   And I guess so.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:29.320]   Well, it is.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.400]   I'm not signed in right now, so it's just,
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.640]   it's giving me kind of a best of thing.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   But if you sign in, it will be your subscriptions.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:39.240]   So in fact, it might be fun to sign out just to see,
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.640]   probably this is what's hot, what's hot on Google Reader,
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.040]   which I read religiously because people are crazy.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.520]   I love the stuff that's hot on Google Reader.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.880]   There's that recommendations tab.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.480]   I think it's that one, right?
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:49.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.160]   Because these are really good.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   I thought these are just really good.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:53.960]   Better than my feed.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.280]   Who are these people?
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.240]   I want to follow them.
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.920]   Yeah, my stuff is just full with tech news, it's boring.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:03.640]   Right, exactly.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.440]   That's a thing.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.880]   There's too many of those key-kit-in-pictures.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.480]   Yeah, I want more kitten pictures.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.320]   So if you want kitten pictures,
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.920]   sign out of your Google Reader account
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.400]   and go to google.com/reader/play.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.280]   Thank you for playing with us, Kevin Marks.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.560]   Well, I'm glad you were here to explain the codec situation and so forth.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.440]   That was a bit long.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.080]   No, no, no, no, no, really, really, really valuable.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:28.600]   That's the thing I really like to do on all of our shows,
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.440]   is get the actual stuff,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.720]   not the short, popular version, but the actual stuff.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:36.760]   And I think it's great to have you.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.000]   Couldn't have a better person on to talk about that.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.320]   Kevin Marks is at ribbit.com.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.040]   And anything else you want to plug these days, Kevin?
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:51.480]   Um, the point of ribbit is it's web APIs for doing telephony stuff.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.600]   So if you're building a web app and think,
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:55.240]   "Oh, it'd be really nice to send an SMS, make a phone call."
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.120]   That's what ribbits for.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.520]   And there's a ribbit robot in Google Wave.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.080]   Yeah, I've been called a widget, a bot.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.040]   What do you call it?
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.160]   There's gadgets and there's bots.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:03.640]   It's a gadget.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.120]   It's a gadget.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.160]   So it's a gadget, yep.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.000]   And Gina Tappani, it's been again,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.080]   another good person to have on a show like this.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.840]   I can't think of a better person, a developer,
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.440]   but also an expert on Google Wave and on productivity.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.640]   She writes at smarterware.org.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.440]   And I'm sure there'll be lots of posts there from Google I/O.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.320]   Come up and visit us.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.760]   You're in the neighborhood.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.800]   I know I'm so close.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.080]   So close, but so far.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.280]   I've got to get to the cottage.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.240]   So close.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.600]   Well, thank you for being on the show.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.480]   I know you want to get back to the conference.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.360]   So we'll let you go.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.680]   So here's one more I just saw.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.000]   Yes.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.280]   This is a prediction API where you give it data
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.360]   and then it tells you what to think about it.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.960]   Oh, what the future will hold.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:44.920]   Is it April 1?
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.280]   No, this is real.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.080]   I saw this.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:47.400]   Yes.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.280]   It's machine learning.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.680]   So you give it like this text is in French,
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.960]   this text is in English, whatever,
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.960]   and then you say here's some text, what is it?
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.960]   French.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.000]   That sounds like fun.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.680]   And it's a routine you can think of interesting things to do
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:39:59.960]   with that with her projects.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960]   Yeah, I think in a way, think tank might really benefit
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.240]   or something like this.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.760]   Yeah, I definitely am going to check this out.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.880]   I'm looking at looking at it now.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.920]   It looks really interesting.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.080]   This is why sentiment analysis.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.640]   Sentiment, is that interesting?
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.760]   Did you see the sarcasm analysis paper this week?
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.600]   This is the problem with sentiment analysis.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.520]   Sentiment analysis came out to take sarcasm.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.040]   And somebody has written that kind of paper.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.240]   How can we find sarcasm?
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.720]   Well, we look for sarcasm and marked it up.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.040]   And the problem with sarcasm is it's fundamentally a lie.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.600]   And computers don't understand lying.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.400]   Right.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.720]   So they were looking for sarcasm.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.480]   It's a really amusing thing.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.360]   That's fascinating.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.240]   It's just like Americans don't get to don't understand irony, Kevin.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:40.840]   Indeed.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.320]   Sentiment analysis.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:43.720]   It's funny.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.560]   As you can say, all these things to them, and it is not.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.680]   I'm trying to think of something sarcastic to say, but I can't.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.280]   So I would just say, thank you for being here.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.640]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.800]   Jeff is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.960]   And we really always appreciate your comments too.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.280]   We've got such a great panel for discussing this.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.960]   Google is so widespread now,
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.360]   but the areas of expertise we got here really makes it fun.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.080]   So thank you guys.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.520]   However, need a codec to be codec talk for me.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.720]   I'm completely useless.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.000]   I hope we didn't put you in too much pain.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.640]   No, no, no, I just I just I can't add nothing to add.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.240]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.880]   I guess we will go back live tomorrow morning.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.360]   830 Pacific 1130 Eastern time.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:37.480]   1530 UTC for the second part of Google's I/O announcements,
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.680]   in which we expect to hear more about Google TV, Android,
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.320]   anything else Gina, you think we're going to get?
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.560]   I think it's going to be mostly Android.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.920]   Yeah, look forward to that.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.840]   So we'll go live 830 AM with breaking news,
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.320]   and then of course we're back to our regular schedule at all.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.000]   Team coverage is this on TV.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:55.640]   Team coverage.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.360]   Well, I think I'm going to be the team tomorrow.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.080]   I'll be live waving.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:01.880]   I'll be live waving.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:02.920]   We'll watch your wave.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.360]   That'll make it a team.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.880]   We do twig every Wednesday afternoon at 4 p.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. Pacific.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:16.920]   I'm sorry, 2,100 UTC at live.tv, so you can watch us do it live.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.360]   But the easiest thing probably to do is download the podcast available.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.200]   Everywhere Better podcasts are given away, absolutely free.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.920]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.920]   (upbeat jazz music)
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.920]   (upbeat jazz music)
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.920]   (upbeat jazz music)
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920]   [Music]
