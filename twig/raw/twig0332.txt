[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.080]   You know, I was all worried because saturday were flying to new jersey and I was all prepared to where I was gonna get a puffy coat
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.240]   Two gloves. Don't need it. Now I need shorts
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   It's

[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.160]   Uh, that'll make it easy for us to take a little time off
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.120]   And then two weeks hence january 6th. We'll be back with live shows. So it's just a quick little big one week vacation
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.560]   I'm excited now. I we've talked before about messaging and how it is the platform of the future
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.640]   Um, there are the problem is there a lot of messaging apps and messaging has that
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.280]   Kind of same issue as you know, social media of all kinds if your friends aren't there. There's no point, right?
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.760]   The people say that's one of the reasons facebook has a you know has a kind of permanent advantage because of the network effect
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.680]   But messaging there's never really been a dominant messaging platform
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Not at least since iCq
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.360]   Then there was aim at microsoft messenger, which was very popular. No, and k i think yeah aim was was
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.760]   Aim was pretty big
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.840]   But aim had the same problem they all did which is you could only talk to other people on the aim network
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.160]   And then there were solutions like trillion and pigeon that allowed you to talk to you know multiple different chat that was nice
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   Then there were things that let you talk to the computer
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.600]   That's questions. Huh. Well, the thing that's interesting to me is that we're go we took a step backwards
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.480]   So they they federated chat and google by the way big player in this with google talk
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.320]   Because it was based on jabber, which was an open source platform a really nice extensible platform for chat
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.880]   and for a while it looked like
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.800]   Well kind of like sms looks now or the phone network looks now
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.360]   It didn't matter what carrier you were on what chat might use because you could still talk to everybody
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   But then companies realized no, we don't want that
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.880]   Because we want to own you
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   So apple had messages which kind of sort of talks to sms, but but only when it feels like it google had hangout same problem
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.520]   What's app huge facebook bought it
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.960]   Uh, there is a whole bunch of pseudo secret
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.720]   Messaging apps like telegram and then the genuinely secret messaging apps like a signal threma
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.720]   um
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   But they none of them talked to one another
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   and now
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.680]   Uh, you know, I've been wanting for some time as facebook's makes messenger its own messenger stronger and stronger
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.720]   They just added uber. I can call it uber from it. I can uh, they have a they're starting an agent process with real life humans
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.200]   The m but it's limited very limited rollout
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   Um, I can send all sorts of stickers and animated gifts and audio and video. I can make hd video calls. I mean
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.720]   I fact it's so ironic because about three days ago. I said all right I give up
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.160]   Because everybody knows on facebook. I'm just gonna use my messenger platform is gonna be facebook
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.040]   What do you use matt?
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.520]   As you well, it's interesting. I was gonna say I mean I use facebook obviously for friends who were on facebook, but
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.200]   um
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.760]   My kids like to use what's app really we actually yeah, we use it. We have a family
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   A group on whatsapp and because it's the closest thing to sort of cross platform and
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.440]   easy to use, you know, there aren't a lot of
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760]   complicated features and if you just want to send a text
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.560]   We're on sort of as long as multiple the summer on my phone somewhere on android. So it's true. It's a cross platform. Yeah
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.800]   Yeah, so it's the closest thing to
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.520]   To sort of a cross platform thing
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.960]   Well, that's to me what it what facebook messenger is and I the problem with what's app is you have to kind of pre arrange
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.080]   Okay, we're all going to use it right right that's the problem
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.000]   But but you could pretty much assume that almost everybody's on facebook
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.080]   Well, and but I was going to say that your family use facebook
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.440]   They do kind of but the girls don't like to use it
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.880]   They they mostly just don't like they kind of have pages, but they don't
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.520]   Okay use facebook messenger that much
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.880]   um
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.440]   And we wanted something kind of private in a way. So what's app used to text
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.280]   Uh, no, we most well yeah, no, we do text
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.400]   Um, if you just want to reach one of them, then I will text them if it's a group thing like we said about christmas
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.720]   chat
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.440]   To you know talk about the things we wanted or yeah, does anybody have a family?
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.000]   Slack chatter
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.440]   Slack chat. I think people do they do I actually thought about setting went up and then I was not free
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.360]   How to use it and it's not free. That's the biggest. All right
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.920]   And what's app is is just a lot easier? I know uh, sara lane, uh and her friends use slack
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.720]   But they probably all work for companies that have pay for slack. So but slack
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.640]   But that's that's what I was going to mention and then they're slack in the in they wouldn't know
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.360]   Enterprise their slack and there's hip chat facebook's try to do facebook at work
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.920]   I don't think it's and there's a correction kick. That's more for the younger sexier people
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.080]   I think I was gonna write about this and never got a chance, but you know slack has been adding so many
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.760]   Integrations of different things like uber and and you know anything with an api you can basically plug into slack
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.680]   um and kick has in fact slack just set up a
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.880]   A platform kind of investment fund so they they're gonna I think it was 80 million dollars. They're gonna
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.480]   Invest in in sort of things that run on slack as a platform and kick
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.280]   I think just invested in a
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.320]   Basically a bot that runs on on the kick network
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.120]   Um, I think that's fascinating that if you look at a lot of Asian countries, they're they're messaging apps already work that way
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.160]   um, so we chat or whatever it is um
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.240]   You can you know, you can order food you can you can
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.200]   Use a sort of tender style dating
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.720]   Service you can do all kinds of different things and it's all done with apps
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.320]   In that live inside your messaging platform. It's clear that everybody's you know looking at what we chat and line are doing and saying okay
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.920]   So who's going to be the one in the us to all because we chat has
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.040]   Huge market restoration and challenge. That's you need that to make it work
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.200]   It was interesting when what's app was slapped by a brazilian judge last week
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.360]   Uh, who said what's app didn't cooperate with a court order and you're we're gonna shut you down for 48 hours
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.920]   What's app in brazil is 90 has 93 percent participation?
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:53.240]   Geez, I was gonna say if you think dumplings if you think globally there was a a map someone posted of
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.720]   What's app use?
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.000]   Versus facebook messenger use and you can see why facebook bought it in almost every country
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.280]   Except the united states. What's app is huge and facebook messenger is tiny
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.160]   You know, there are countries where what's app?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.960]   It is more dominant than every
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   texting
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.160]   Function of every telecom player. I saw a picture
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.440]   Like this is a year and a half ago of women at bus stops in india with saris where the
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.320]   Um, the fabric was once applicable. Wow. Nice. Wow. Now. That's a bucket a year
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.080]   Low it that's a bucket year, but that's actually we've got a billion users not
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.800]   Not insignificant and it's interesting they they implemented the bucket year thing first to slow their growth
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.360]   Because they were actually growing too quickly
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.560]   And so they wanted to slow it down a bit and then they took it away again
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.360]   And then they implemented it again because they were growing too fast
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.800]   Well, and a bucket year looks cheap and one of the reasons what's app does so well in countries like brazil because the
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.000]   Local carriers are so rapacious with their sms
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.720]   Plans it's so expensive 20 cents a message and more in some cases that a buck sounds like nothing
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:08.280]   uh, because you can use one sap unlimited and uh, so and that's where I think a lot of people didn't realize
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.360]   What's app was a big deal because in north america free texting?
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:19.160]   Is pretty common so hardly anybody pays for us exactly and so that everyone texts right but in lots of other countries
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.040]   It's it's hugely expensive to send a single text
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.040]   I text all the time and I think it's interesting both google and and apple
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.920]   Had a strategy to kind of sign all in by making their texting apps
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.720]   support internet messaging
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.880]   Particularly apple with messages so that it
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   Because they had an iMessage an apple messaging system that wasn't that way and they said no wait a minute
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.900]   You know if we make iphones text messaging be
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.000]   Messages then we can kind of and I think google thought the same thing with hangouts, but then
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.720]   All of a sudden said and this is where I felt like google was really missing the boat
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.360]   By the way, if you want to talk about missing the boat, it's microsoft which killed msn messenger
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.920]   And now wants everybody use skype messaging and no and I don't think anybody wants to use it
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.400]   So microsoft's the laggard here, but everybody understands the power and the reason I bring this up is the wall street journal
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:20.840]   Yesterday published a rumor that google's going to launch a new messaging platform. This kind of explains what we had read
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:28.680]   The google fine when you sign up for five says we would prefer that you use google's messages not hangouts
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.200]   Interesting and I and there's no technical reason for this. In fact, I continue to use hangouts as my
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.000]   Text slash messaging app, but now I understand or this makes sense
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.560]   Incidentally that judge who declared a 48-hour moratorium
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.640]   Was overruled by a higher court who said this is you can't do that
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.920]   No, and they after 12 hours
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.160]   Of shutdown in brazil of what's app they turned it back on again people were furious
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.880]   Brazil brazil is the most internet unsung and I've said this on the show before but most unsung internet addicted country there is
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.600]   It's truly a doctor of all early adopters. They adopted remember photo to social
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   Remember I don't know work it work it was working. It was it was the last effect the last
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.520]   Bastion
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.200]   Yeah, it was the first and last there and and so brazil's amazing the stuff
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.360]   You don't you don't mess with razillion the internet and every time you look at a new I remember
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.560]   What was that thing that dave?
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.160]   morn
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.440]   Of path. Yeah, so path was gigantic
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.560]   Long after everyone had forgotten about it in north america got acquired
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.720]   Yeah, by who do who bought path was it japanese? I can't remember. Yeah
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.440]   So so what's but but the google service?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.680]   In strikes because as I understand it you can ask questions of a bot as well for reopening so let's talk about this
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.360]   This is a weird article so alice dare bar writing in the wall street journal
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.760]   a couple of days ago
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.560]   most of this article is not about googles the hook of the article is
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   this
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.760]   Leak that he got or a story he got from somebody that google has been working on a
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.920]   on a messaging service, but then it goes on talking about other stuff completely about other stuff
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.000]   So really he's the only one fact in here which is right which is
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.080]   Uh for its new service google plans to integrate chat bots software programs that answer questions inside a messaging app
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   So that to me is a replacement for search. That's not a chat
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.480]   Messaging program. Well, I think it's a conversational version of search
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.960]   I think if well, it's a way to integrate search. I think yes
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.680]   But clearly what google would like to do is have I would guess is have a messaging platform
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.360]   Much like we chat that does everything and one way to do that is with bots
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.800]   Because you don't have to and by the way telegram has bots
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.600]   In fact google acquired a company that does a lot of bots or no they tried to call 200 labs
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.160]   200 labs said no
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.160]   That's right
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.240]   But they make bots on telegram in fact I have a bot a chief twit bot that said that tells people things like when it shows
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.120]   About to start when I pull up my car up front
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:16.280]   When I weigh myself things like that and uh, it's very easy to make a bot for a telegram
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.960]   I imagine google will attempt to do something similar. They did attempt to buy this company
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.400]   But bots bots don't have to just be searches jeff they could be anything the bot could i could say to the bot
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.680]   Get me a train tickets to if you know, right. So I think this is and I think I think it goes to voice
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   Oddly it goes back to voice where you're talking and say, you know make a reservation for six at ba-da-da-da
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.160]   Uh that kind of command system. It's beyond theory and beyond google now
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.600]   Um it enables functionality behind that with a different interface
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:53.240]   What strikes me about this more than anything else is that it's it's not the intentionality of typing a query or sending a message
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.480]   it's
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.040]   Do something for me? It seems to be more of an extension and dissolved rumors and it's all just leaks
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.840]   But but it seems to me a logical extension of google now
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.280]   I think it is. I think that's what they want to do. They want to become a part of
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.560]   Your life and all the things you do and at some point i'm sure they're going to have
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.120]   bots that respond to
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.880]   Without you having to even ask a question bots that say, you know, I noticed you're at this place
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.840]   Um, would you like to do x?
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.240]   Have you sent your mother or birthday present?
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.920]   This could be and for google, this is a high stakes operation because
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.840]   They wanted to beat twitter and facebook and they did google buzz
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.360]   Right
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.040]   And they do not want this to be buzz they're and google plus
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   They only really are going to get one in my opinion one chance to get this right
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.200]   Because if if it's going to work they have to get the network effect big time
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.360]   They have to do something that people go. Yes. Oh my god. This is so great. Everybody. Hey everybody
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.520]   We're leaving facebook
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   Everybody on to google
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.320]   That's the thing i'm questioning here leo. I'm not sure it's
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.400]   Their next social effort of leaving facebook again based on this little tiny bit of information
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.280]   By the way, right now at google there's five people sitting in the room saying
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.800]   We'll call us. We'll put you on
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.680]   We will we'll i'd like to know what you do and nik fox apparently has been leaving leading a team for at least a
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.080]   Year according to wall street. Look what happened with messenger. Look at look at google has such a huge
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.760]   installed base of gmail users and people who use all kinds of google services
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.000]   No one uses google chat or hangouts or mess
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.440]   But i know you think that's but i'm saying no one and kind of it didn't take off broad term
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.080]   They thought they offered video they offered group chat right so why why
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.200]   Why they've got this massive installed base
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.800]   They need to do something extra even google plus i agree
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:55.880]   Which they basically forced people to use or tried to by connecting it to all their other google services
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.040]   So what is it going to take?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   What if they federated with everything?
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.360]   Federation would be so awesome and google's the only company that would do that because
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.920]   Facebook really wants to be siloed right everybody wants twitter wants to be siloed
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.040]   They all want i think that's actually slacks sort of core
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.480]   Value in a way obviously its design is great too, but i remember talking to steward
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.360]   Butterfield early on before it was you know worth however many billions it's worth now and i said what do you think?
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.520]   Why is it?
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:33.880]   Why is slack going to be any better than the 15 other things that people use to do similar things and he said the main reason is we're going to integrate
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:40.600]   With everything and he's service you use any website any other messaging class names
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.640]   Well, I don't know about that now see that's the key though
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.960]   Right and I think if you if they just build something that's
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   You know if you go back to your analogy of msn and icq and and a ol and so on if they just build another messaging
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.720]   Thing that's cool. I don't think enough people are gonna use it. I agree. They can't be google
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   Let's try this out as google ever succeeded at being the fourth in and then winning it
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.320]   Google tends to invent
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.280]   Google tends to invent well search or the templates
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.680]   Yeah, but you know what i mean?
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.840]   They they they did a quantum leap of the value of search right google is an inventing company when google invents it
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.120]   Or buys it really early like youtube
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.080]   Yeah, they can make it work when google comes into
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.800]   Things late
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.560]   They don't tend to understand that they're mimicking the wrong thing. I feel like google has a very poor track record
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.480]   Definitely this stuff. I really know plus is a great example
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:47.720]   Unless his matthew says wave was new. We're not guessing wave was pretty new was actually new wave was actually new uh android
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.440]   So android they acquired and uh and you took the acquired
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   acquired
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.480]   Gmail okay gmail was invented at google
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.200]   Yep, you know what they could do they could buy kick
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.120]   Kick I don't know if it has the right reputation. I always think of kick as the place people go to share naked pictures
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.320]   Yeah, I think they they sort of have that reputation
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.360]   The story is that tell me the more though
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:21.720]   This is going to be bait. This is going to be augmented by AI course these days. What isn't you're going to have AI yogurt before long but but
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.920]   A chat system doesn't need AI
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:31.560]   A do things for your system needs AI as matthew said something that's going to anticipate your needs needs AI
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.440]   I don't see myself typing you know asking how old is uh, you know john cassavetes on a chatbot
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.920]   No, I don't know. That's why I don't think it's what it is. Do you remember smarter child? No, smart or child
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.480]   Yeah, it's uh fascinating
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.200]   I remember my kids using it
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.440]   And they're like 18 20
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   So well and windows live messenger chatter bot
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:03.400]   Yeah, it was a chat bot, but and you could ask it things the idea was you could ask it things like if you were doing your homework or
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.520]   You wanted a fact it's like wikipedia except a chat bot
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.400]   Um, it was a fascinating experiment actually and I know a bunch of
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.840]   Uh kids used it. I don't know how seriously they used it or how much they just tried to
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.280]   You know get it to say dumb things looks like a lysa
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.040]   Yeah, very similar. Yeah, chris says okay. Here's my idea. We can get married smarter child
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.240]   What do you mean? Okay? Here's your idea. We can get married. Let's get married right now pretty dumb
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.320]   Why do you want us to get married?
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.000]   Yes, hmm. I love you more than anyone I've ever loved
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   Huh? You're often kind of uncool to me says smarter child. What I gave you my soul says the human
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.720]   Whatever you say chris
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.240]   That is a non-constructive way to deal with this dialogue. I know it's a non-constructive way to deal with this dialogue
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:57.000]   Then let's get serious should we really get serious? It's that a lysa repeating back to you every time
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.560]   Yeah, and it was very rudimentary, right? I mean, it was a long time ago
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.680]   I'm sure i started my old colleagues a lot. Really?
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.640]   Really? I'm looking up right now, robert hofer timothy k peter leavatann in 2000
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.840]   They created something they just started early internet bots
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.600]   Ask it a question that we've got the answer for you and it was called
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.960]   Active buddy then converse agent then colloquous
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.600]   Microsoft bought it and the patents oh interesting for 46 million
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.800]   Interesting. I want to apologize to slack because they do offer I thought you had to buy it
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.080]   But they do offer unlimited free use for unlimited sized teams
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:42.360]   uh, so but but the the setup for slack is wrong because you have to create a team
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.040]   Yeah, and then people have to be invited to your team
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.560]   Yeah, and so that's fine for family or friends or work
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:56.040]   But what you really want is a universal messaging platform that and I actually have when this came up the other day
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.800]   I said I thought slack could theoretically kind of eat twitter in a way by right by providing kind of public
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.440]   You know, yeah, I think that's one
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.960]   In the other hand, I don't think you're actually interested in doing that like my
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.600]   Money is an enterprise. They're focused on the enterprise. Yeah. Yeah, and Matthew
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.560]   Would you want slack spam something coming in? You're talking in your work group. You're doing something suddenly a message comes in from
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.600]   Rana out of nowhere. Hey, did you like Star Wars? You know, I would have to be filtered somehow
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.480]   but I think they I do think they've they've
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.360]   they're the first kind of
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.760]   relatively modern
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   chat kind of
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.440]   IRC style thing that that I've really thought has a chance to
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.080]   You know to get kind of mass
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:47.880]   Use they the design is is well done. Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's really kind of low barriers 10-3 or low
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.240]   I love slack by the way. They're a sponsor. So
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.880]   Disclamations the way we communicate inside absolutely every enterprise that goes to it says wow. This is it
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.240]   I've been looking for this
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.280]   There was a great chart actually of a email usage after a company implements slack
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.600]   It was literally a ski slope right going straight down much better
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.360]   And the bots are great and the gif bots and we have an Alex Trebek Jeopardy bot and ours
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.320]   There's a melody Kramer who works for used to work at mpr
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.960]   Came up with a bot for her
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.560]   She works for this government lab thing called 18f now and the bot if you use a
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.040]   Male or female
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.360]   Like you say guys or or something like that it pops up and suggests
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:40.120]   A gender neutral that's good terms that you can use that's dead. We have a bot but every time you say
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.600]   Uh, what is what is it? What is Borat says? That's nice every time you say that's nice
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.120]   Borat pops up. Nice. That is not a great bot. So they are kind of fun though. They're fun. Imagine
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.800]   That's what it is
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.040]   And look at you know look at some of the things they've got bots doing on wechat the potential is huge
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   And it makes work a lot less grim if everyone's so all Borat pops up
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.240]   But but so here's the thing I want google to do this because I am not I feel like facebook because they own
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.920]   WhatsApp and because they're really making strides now with messenger
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.880]   And and because everybody I know is already on it has a huge inside track to this
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.280]   But I for one and I think i'm not alone would far rather use a google solution of this
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.640]   Than a facebook solution right? I mean I I went kippie. I wanted to use telegram
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.400]   But I but only a few people use telegram. I couldn't give that to be you know
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.720]   You can't how do you so how do you get all those people who are using facebook messenger to use this google thing?
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.920]   I don't
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.280]   How do you?
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.960]   I don't know the thing about it is everybody you know is already on facebook except for a few weird grumpy people
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.680]   Yeah
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.800]   So that's the that's number one. It's like you don't want to use a cell phone that can only reach 30 percent of
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.360]   The one who knows they can find me there or twitter, but we're we're you know, we're
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:06.200]   Odd that we're on twitter most of the world's on facebook not on twitter right you can find somebody there right google google does have all your
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.120]   dress books
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   You do have somebody's email address. So so here's another question. What about I am via email address versus phone now because the other
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.920]   Facebook has it's already on your phone
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.000]   Yeah, it's already and google you would have to I mean if I want you to communicate with me on the new google platform
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.800]   I'm gonna get to have to talk you into putting it on my phone your phone
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.440]   And uh, phone the facebook has such a I know but it's a stick mechanism
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.840]   But it's something you need a you need a globally unique identifier of some kind yes, yes
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.760]   And a phone number is the best there is that well emails good too, right and google is the agent of email
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.080]   Actually, it's what i'm talking about
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.360]   Using letting you use your phone to log into things right?
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.520]   That's all that's also a story. We'll talk about I think facebook owns this one unless google has some
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:02.040]   Good. This is this this is one i tried to resist facebook messenger. I tried to resist facebook kept saying
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.400]   Remember when they made it a separate app. Yep, they're like, hey, no, you can't do that anymore
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.480]   You have to download a separate app and i'm like screw you. I don't want to and then okay both of you
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.560]   What about the one that messages show up
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:20.120]   The bubble is a zero change like you could turn off chat heads, but you know what hate that thing. I know but you know what
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.080]   That's it's actually an interesting notification system. I let i turned it back on
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.440]   Yeah, I did too. I hate it, but I turned it back on. I hate the way it comes
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.920]   I know it goes on overtop all my own, but then you know when you get a message
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   ugh
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.680]   But that's the thing they have this giant stick
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.640]   So all my friends and family would be messaging me and it would be like hey, you got a message
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.480]   But you can't reply to me you can turn off chat right your end up you end up installing it
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.240]   Yeah, so I wound up installing I kind of wish they do a separate desktop app
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.920]   Because I don't want to have to go into the facebook page to do messaging
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.720]   Actually deleted the facebook app altogether and started using just the mobile site
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.160]   So did I stuff so much friggin ram? Oh interesting
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.880]   And really but you still have the standalone messenger app. I do yeah
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.160]   That they knew you were gonna do that. That's why they get that's why they separated messenger app
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.880]   I now i'm even even with some of my colleagues like making moroni i'm saying let's you i want to use telegram
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.600]   I want to use hangouts. I want it, but no, let's use messenger
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.120]   And then it's pretty appealing
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.720]   You could send money
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.440]   I sent lisa dollar it was really easy and by the way in order to do that aren't you generous?
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.840]   No big spender in order you don't need a facebook account anymore. Nope
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.680]   And in order to no in order to send her a dollar
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:46.520]   I had to register my atm card debit cards only and she had to receive it. She had to register hers. Now they've got them
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.680]   Oh man
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.360]   Now they got my card
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.000]   I think that they I I think are hard to beat at this point
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.040]   Google you better come up with something really good because i'll use you if you come up with something good, but the network effects are just so huge huge
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.760]   bibillion people yeah
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.120]   Oh
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:10.040]   It's it's like saying i'm gonna do a new cell phone system, right, but everybody you know will have to get a new cell phone
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   They gonna work or they can use their cell phone, but they have to switch to this other network in order to talk to you. Yeah
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   Yeah
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.880]   And that's it's such a step backward because that's where we were with chat originally
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:32.120]   Uh with messaging originally and then we got federated and I wish we'd and even apple was doing federated remember apple worked i chat work with aim
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:39.640]   Google was doing the problem is now the problem is I think they all realize like that's why facebook but
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.240]   What's happened the first place and paid 19 billion dollars for it a company with no revenue at all
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.640]   Because I think they understand that this is the future
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.920]   Of of communication period. You know, this is things are gonna flow through messaging
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:02.680]   Facebook's messaging might actually disappear facebook's messaging was actually an earlier acquisition before uh, what's app called beluga
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:09.800]   Which was a great group messaging app? I remember using it. Yep. Yeah, and facebook bought them and that's what became messenger
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.080]   But so now there's there's even less incentive for them to federate because they know
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.240]   You control the messaging platform you control
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:26.440]   Basically people's social interactions. This will be a case study in uh dropped balls missed opportunities
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.400]   particularly for google
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.480]   But but microsoft as well
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:36.760]   And this is one where facebook really can leverage their existing uh strengths
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.000]   And it is interesting that google, you know google messenger google chat google hangouts
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.360]   You know free
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.600]   voice calls free video calls free
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.800]   And and it works great. You know, it's integrated with your email if you use gmail
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.760]   It's a those are fantastic services that very few people use
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   So it's just it doesn't matter how good they are
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.320]   Oh, here's an interesting thing that the chat room has just sent me
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.280]   You can add facebook messaging to apples messenger. It allows you to add accounts
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.400]   For yahoo google and uh icloud, but even more than that
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.120]   uh, you can add
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   other messages accounts
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.320]   And you can choose
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.040]   Well, now I don't this jabber and then you'll do if you need to do facebook
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.440]   I mean, let me I have to go back and look at this article
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.680]   Yeah jabber because okay, so this is interesting. This is xmpp
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.040]   Mm-hmm apparently facebook supports xmpp
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.560]   I'm not sure it supports it completely. Yeah, you probably don't get uh like some of the features
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.320]   But that's interesting there's a so apples continue to federate
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.520]   For a little while
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.080]   Till they realize it's funny how if you look at um
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.960]   trying to think of a good example, but
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.400]   If you're the dominant player
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.040]   Then there's no incentive for you to fit it at all don't fit at all that everybody else
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.800]   There's that there's actually an incentive because they want to eat into your
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.320]   Architecture. Yeah, so there. Yeah, there could be some pushback, you know from non facebook
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.480]   Um, maybe they'll all get together apple and google and right
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:27.800]   But I think the idea of it's fascinating to me the idea of sort of computing
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.280]   and search and
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   AI kind of
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.440]   coming to you not through
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.280]   Dedicated apps or through your desktop but through a messaging app
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.600]   Well, so
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.800]   I put up an essay that or a piece that that veriner foals the cto of amazon
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.080]   wrote
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.040]   Um, and and i put up just get some help to understand it
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.960]   But he talked about simplification in the next year
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.080]   And and and serverless world, but his example and that was a company called teletext.io
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.720]   Yeah, I remember yeah
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.760]   I had not heard of them and and so it's content as service
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.000]   It's content just sits out there as a blob floating like water in the space station
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.480]   And and then you pull it into whatever you want to pull it into right you pull it and you and you manipulate it there
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.320]   Uh is the way I interpret this so so if you're in media for example
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.160]   The blob you make can go into phase instant articles and it can go into apple and go into
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.320]   Do we have to call it a blob?
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.880]   I'm going to not it's henceforth met you it is the blob the blob is a contest blob
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.280]   um, so but now you you put that into the into the discussion we've just had
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.640]   Uh that in a in a queried world
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:42.440]   Uh, you just say I want I want this and and and the the bot knows what's the best blob to get?
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.440]   Sorry matthew. It's a blob now. It's really a
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.960]   um
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   What's the blob you really want from out in a world of of uh, yes those URLs, but they aren't going they're they're they're more like
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:59.240]   URIs they're not going to pages. They're going to information content blobs
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:06.040]   Of various media and various sorts and information things and they could be from databases. They could be from other things and they just sit out there
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.960]   um
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.720]   It changes the fundamental structure of how what we thought of the web is a page based structure and a uh,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.880]   media content based structure and actually when you think about it, we're already there, right?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.920]   I mean, yeah, the facebook stream the twitter stream
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.960]   They're they're sort of unending waterfalls of all kinds of not blobs. No blobs enough. No
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.160]   Will my column blobs
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:39.960]   Items of content, you know, I think that one thing that interests me about it actually and I think that's a good point
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.920]   Jeff the one thing then it's just me is that it's kind of bringing
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.640]   Computing in a way back to
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.360]   To kind of old fashioned, you know, people talking to each other in a way
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:57.240]   So you you chat with a bot you ensure it's a bot and it's a I maybe or it's a combination of humans
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.720]   in a I but in a way you're kind of
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:05.080]   You're just talking to someone and it so the sort of conversational
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:11.720]   Aspect and the the kind of human interaction aspect becomes way more important than
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:18.920]   What your web page looks like or all these sort of other desktop design considerations. What's content?
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   It's about interactions. Yeah. Yeah, which is fascinating and it's it just reminds me of how
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.880]   One of Marshall McLuhan's things was, you know, what new technology?
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.520]   What does it bring back from the past? What does this sort of recapture?
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:43.080]   And social media in a way has recaptured that kind of verbal, you know, conversational aspect of society
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.960]   exactly I'm gonna send a
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:52.040]   Leo running into a commercial break here, but yes, it brings up the gutenberg parenthesis. I'd like to talk about my sheets
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:36:01.640]   What's the gutenberg parenthesis you heard that the show with I know I know but I want to give you an opportunity to explain
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.520]   That as matt you just said what what happened the gutenberg was a grand 600 year exception
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.280]   And what the internet does is bring us back to a conversational era back to the verbal
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.560]   Up up. That's a short version. I want not just verbal by the way
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.560]   Of visual as well. Yes. I mean look at instagram, which is still my one of my favorite social networks
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.600]   It's all pictures photo was laid. It's non-verbal
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.880]   But that's what a great messaging app does, you know, basically we chat has instagram
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.200]   Has a blog
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.800]   You can live in we chat if you're a chinese and you can do business in there and totally do business
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.200]   So here's my prediction
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.000]   Facebook already has won
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.440]   It's over
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:50.920]   So what googled inevitably do is attempt something give it up and then federate or offer a service for the facebook messenger
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.080]   If you I was shocked because when I first heard about a year ago
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.840]   At
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.320]   F8 we were that we were covering F8 the facebook was going to invite people to write apps for messenger
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   I thought haven't and haven't people learned anything
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.560]   Remember all those games people wrote for the facebook platform
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.600]   We're seeing a little money on it at the time, but she's throwing
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.200]   Yeah
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.480]   But I'm stunned if I now that I've gone to the messenger route
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:24.920]   How many uh, how many apps mostly kind of animated gifts and things but how many apps have been written for that platform and and I think it's going to snowball
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.080]   Very soon
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   You know, it's not the R doomed
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.760]   Did you
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.880]   I would I would read a twit app for facebook messenger. Hell yeah
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.440]   Did you read about facebook m
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.520]   Yeah, so it's their kind of
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.560]   AI style, it's not an AI though. It's human. No
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.440]   Exactly, but what I found fascinating was I'm trying to remember if it was buzzfeed or
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:54.040]   Somebody was basically querying facebook m and trying to get it to admit that it was human beings
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.400]   And it kept pretending that it was actually bots
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.800]   So it was pretending that it was AI and and not human beings
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.680]   Which I found fascinating you would think it would be the opposite
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.760]   Yeah, they would want you to think it was human beings
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.120]   But I think they actually want people to think this little smarter than just personal otherwise
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.240]   So is google's is this google thing facebook's m
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:22.280]   Or is this google's sounds that way to me? It sounds that way to me. I mean we have both unreleased both cast about
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.800]   Yep, yeah
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.520]   But I think it's the way to go and if google wants to try and make their messenger thing
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.280]   Different that's the only way to do it is to have better
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.360]   bots
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   Well, or and I predict again
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.440]   They will fail they will fail and then they will make
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.360]   Bots that interact that are in both facebook messenger
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:50.280]   Imagine if you could have a bot if you could create a bot and it could live in a bunch of different
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.840]   Networks like I could move around
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.640]   That's the blob
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.840]   theory
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.520]   Right where where you there's a messaging world. I've had an interaction
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   I've seemed to want something right now and you've got to be blob ready
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.280]   To be fed by some agent or some person into that conversation
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:14.360]   Right you have to be able to inject here with yes or be injected you have to be injected by some other
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.800]   agent
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.200]   So i'm chatting i'm chatting with my daughter
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.080]   In messenger right now
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.760]   Yes, that's my thing. Okay. No, but I was and she's in Hawaii
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.880]   She's on vacation with her mom and her brother in Hawaii
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.600]   And I've been sending her I want to get everybody first of all everybody's on facebook
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:41.320]   So I don't have to figure out where she's just go. Oh let's send a message to abbey and i'm sending her animated gifs
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:49.560]   I'm sending her pictures and talk about nonverbal communication. Yeah. Yeah, I mean this and it's incredible
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.600]   I actually was very skeptical. I have to admit
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.320]   You know as an english major and someone who gets paid to use big words and whatnot
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.880]   I was very skeptical about emojis as a as a method of communication because I thought
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.760]   They were dumb and you know for kids and but i'm fascinated in a way by the
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:12.840]   By how they change the way that you communicate but emojis are so 2014 now we got stickers
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:18.680]   We got animated. Yes, the same idea though, and it's non so it's nonverbal
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.600]   Right slack you you can really see how it changes
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.120]   The way people communicate instead of them responding
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:33.240]   with a long text message that someone might misinterpret or you know trying to be sarcastic and someone doesn't get it
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.800]   yeah a gif or a
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.160]   Emoji can communicate so much with a single image. It's fascinating
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:47.640]   I I really like communicating this way now if you put now ad m to this I can send money
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:54.840]   Uh, you know, I could say and I think that google's right that I would love to say what's the weather in bayon, New jersey
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.960]   Yeah, that would be a reasonable thing for me to do especially if I get used to start talking to these and of course
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.000]   Or what if you don't have to say what if you show up in bayon and and a bot maybe my now stuff
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.120]   Oh, yeah, oh, I noticed that you're in bayon. Oh, you have to be a little worried about too much clutter in here though too, right?
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.200]   Yeah, no, you do. Yeah
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.600]   And you'd have to approve bots. I'm sure you know give them authority to speak
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.040]   I go back to we talked about this ages and ages because we're marissa mire when I talked about hyper level
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   She talked about the hyper personal news stream right that if somebody can analyze me
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:33.560]   This is where google's ahead of facebook google has priority in box and google knows what you care about in your transactions with people
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.920]   True in a different way google knows where you are
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.600]   Uh, they know where you live and where you work because then you know you go back and forth all the time because of ways and maps
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.920]   Uh, they know what you care about and search for so they have very complimentary
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.640]   Um, you know, it's interesting knowledge but google has knowledge of
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.320]   kind of
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.600]   What you might call transactional or yes, you know the emails that you accept and the ones you don't facebook has something that's much closer to a
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.800]   Kind of emotional, you know, I saw you right away. Yeah, social and emotional
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.520]   Rangers are very i always get confused which ones which
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.560]   I don't know
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   Right brain
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.800]   What's that?
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.640]   The artistic space book is Facebook is right brain google is left brain
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.560]   Yes, right and it'll be interesting to see how they they approach it
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:32.440]   I mean one of google's problems has been all their social attempts fail because they're fundamentally engineering driven
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.280]   You know in a way you could argue they're they're left brain driven
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:42.200]   as opposed to sort of emotionally or or kind of you know driven by human experience
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   And so they they ultimately fail not because they're designed badly
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.960]   but because I don't think they really think about the way that human beings
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.440]   Work like how they behave what they want
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:02.200]   Sheets
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   Sheets
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.440]   All right, we'll move on. I it's a great discussion and it's um
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.400]   It's about your idea. I thought you're ready there as well. Yeah, I am heading there. I'm just i'm i think we've covered it
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.520]   But I just uh, so i'm not surprised to hear google doing this
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   I feel like they waited to they had a handle on it with hangouts and they blew it
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.280]   Of course, we still have no idea what this is there's five people with google laughing their heads off right now saying that
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.120]   But what they're saying makes perfect sense
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.000]   That's exactly how google would approach this
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.600]   And it ain't gonna matter because no one owns the phone
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.320]   and uh
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.840]   True
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.840]   That's why facebook already won
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.080]   Okay, but here's here's the other
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.200]   Hold the sheets off of it. Here's the other thing
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.560]   the inside of google plus may it may it suffer in peace is
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.640]   um
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:00.040]   Bob wyman taught me this ages ago used for for google that it's recipient controlled the problem with email is it's center control
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.120]   That's why it's banned and
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   What you need is recipient control communication
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.000]   And so facebook and google plus are both essentially recipient control
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.960]   You can you can block somebody you can kill it. You don't care
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.600]   I care where that comes in through to me messenger apps are recipient controlled
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.400]   The problem is right now you've got two
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.840]   um
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:27.400]   Identity spaces out there right one is phone number. That's that's anachronistic as hell because who's gonna have a phone at some point
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.200]   The second is your facebook identification. Well, that's okay. That's that's the most universal thing we have
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.840]   The third is email
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.800]   Which google has a better handle on than facebook does
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   And is there a fourth?
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.840]   Is there some amount of that in identity space?
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.880]   And if you can grab onto it in the space
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.520]   Um google's best hope is email
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.040]   But what about email that's basically recipient controlled
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:58.520]   I don't know just making it up. Well, they're trying to do that. That's what priority inbox and all those other things are about
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.800]   Right. It's interesting that facebook tried to get into email. Do you remember your second email?
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.280]   Yeah box the one that i forgot about yeah
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.240]   Now that was a facebook address. What a train wreck that was yeah
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.800]   That was as bad as any social thing that google has ever tried because it just wasn't you know, they were trying to do something that didn't
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:21.400]   Fit and I don't think they understood how to go about it or maybe it was just too late
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:32.040]   Um and you can by the way even message people on facebook that aren't your friends, but it goes into a weird
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.960]   Inbox that they have to then accept you which I think of looking at once a year, right?
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.440]   Well, you'll be looking at it more going forward
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:47.720]   I think they'll make you I predict I couldn't even find it. It's so hidden. I forgot where it was. Yeah
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:56.520]   Our show today brought to you that by the sheets I slept on last night well not those specific sheets you'll probably get nice new ones
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.840]   But they could come from the same place
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   Bolin branch dot com. Oh, they're so soft and comfy. I love my Bolin branch sheets
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.680]   A lot of times people talk about thread count as if that's the holy grail when it comes to
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:16.520]   Bedding and linens. It's not it's a marketing term. It's not the thread count. It's the quality of the cotton the quality of the sheet
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.600]   Bolin branch
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   makes amazing sheets
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.120]   from organic fair trade certified cotton
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:30.120]   And they're made in fair trade certified factories and they donate a portion of every sale to
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:36.760]   Charity and because you're not buying in an apartment store where the markup can be as much as 800 percent you're getting
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.720]   very very fair prices on the best sheets you've ever slept on
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.680]   A couple hundred bucks you could treat yourself to the same luxuriously comfortable bedding
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.440]   That us presidents and countless celebrities swear by
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.080]   I love my bowl and branch sheets. They're so soft
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.960]   Did I mention that they're soft
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.560]   Give the gift of great sleep this holiday season go to bo ll bowl like cotton bowl

[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.600]   They look like it's a I mean when I got my ball and branch I thought did I just is this a wedding gift
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.080]   No, those are the sheets you ordered they're beautiful, but what a great gift. You don't have to wrap it
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.040]   Could be your new year gift
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.600]   Sheets towels blankets duvet covers and more plus free shipping
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:40.440]   And those beautiful boxes and you even can try and risk free for 30 nights. I mean that this is so nice a perfect night's sleep
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.160]   Bo ll and

[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:06.600]   You wouldn't want your little baby to be sleeping or anything, but the softest nicest sheets are so soft
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.840]   Beautiful cotton comforters too. Oh, I love them bowl and branch dot com off or go twig
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   Oh
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:27.960]   Okay, you want a scary here's this here's a scary holiday. Oh, I love this
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:34.680]   This is posted by Boston Dynamics, which is the the company that google bought the robot company
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:41.240]   And you know, let's go to youtube so we can go full screen with this because it'll be even more terrifying
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:51.640]   It's those crazy Boston dynamics dog robots
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.080]   Pulling us
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:03.160]   Crazy no, they're cute. They're not cute. We'll become running down your throat
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.000]   They're not cute and how much time did it take them to sync them with the music?
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.560]   Oh, they did didn't they yeah, they sync them. Well, they're robots. They could do anything
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:19.000]   Actually, that's like hey someone someone used as an example of how google doesn't get
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.200]   They don't get creepy say Christmas or humor. Oh, no, I think it's huge. I think it's pretty fun
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:33.240]   Yeah, I love to be I mean, I think it's Boston dynamics. I don't know if google had a saying right? No
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   Um
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   That was pretty great. I started giggling when I saw it
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:49.320]   Yeah, yeah me too. I would buy one of those things one of those little dog robots really? Oh, yeah
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.400]   I'd use it if I could ride down the streets of New York in it on
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:59.960]   You could you'd have to learn how to ride a horse all over again. I had a cat or not. It'd be a great western, wouldn't it? Yeah
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.840]   Robot horses robot western
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.640]   Um
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   Westworld with dual breader
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.960]   Oh god remake west westworld with Boston dynamics. That would be awesome
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.320]   Oh, here's a google product that I think is going to succeed
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.160]   Of course there are autonomous vehicles they're way ahead of the game on this and everybody and their brothers doing it
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.720]   But now we learn apparently
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.120]   Corne yahoo autos that they're going to work with ford
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   They're they've got a manufacturing partner. This will be announced if it's true in a couple of weeks at ces fort always makes a big splash at ces
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.240]   and should point out that our
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.880]   One of the auto riders at fortune said
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:46.680]   Um, her source is told her that's not true. Oh rats. So I know I don't know who you're gonna trust yahoo or fortune fortune
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.280]   I'm not saying it's not true. I'm just saying that's what she said
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:54.920]   That's too bad the deal is non-exclusive according to yahoo
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.480]   Which means it might be that they've got deals with other car manufacturers
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.760]   Um, but that makes it does make sense that google wouldn't try to build these themselves
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   No, no, right? No, I I agree though. Can I do a moments rant?
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.320]   Who could stop you? Go ahead. Yeah
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.000]   So I've been as you as I mentioned on the show i've been trying to get by car
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.400]   I've been trying to go on with android auto. I've been going crazy
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.480]   I was this close to buying an Audi
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.360]   But they wouldn't they couldn't give me the answer. I went I I email the pr people I will talk to them on twitter
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.400]   I asked for two dealers anybody to get me any information on when these two models are going to have android auto
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.320]   It's a simple question. Just give me the answer so I can know how much to put it in my car
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.920]   And the dealership gives me all this stuff because we know information all doesn't call it doesn't do anything
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:48.360]   I bug them again. They send me something to the web page for android auto. Hello. I can read that
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.000]   Nothing nothing right toiota. We have toiota's they've been very reliable
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.280]   Wife goes in and we have a contractual loner now
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.280]   We find out that toiota corporate has ended all loners and only rental cars
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.880]   And we have vox wacken which has gone through you know almost amoral scandals imaginable
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.360]   uh polluting the entire earth
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.080]   the auto companies as a whole
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.880]   are a mess
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:19.080]   And tesla's not ready to take their place yet, but there's an opportunity for branding here
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.480]   I think to reconsider so I think at google if they were doing this would be a mistake
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   To think that they could become a huge auto company overnight, right?
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.480]   But it's also a mistake. I think to tie their hit to hitch their robot
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:38.440]   To somebody else's wagon when the branding of those wagons. I would address this for metaphors is
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.520]   So besmirched
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.160]   Uh, I can't stand any auto company these days and I go to their sites and try to find the features and try to buy a car
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   And they make it so ridiculously impossible
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.400]   and uh
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.360]   So yeah, I buy a google car one before I buy a four car
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.880]   Hmm
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.800]   I mean, I'd buy a google car long before I would buy a Ford a google
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.440]   Yeah
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.720]   So driving car
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:04.360]   By the way, I would buy a google car one before I would buy let's say a microsoft car or you don't pick your other brand
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:09.000]   Or apple apple supposed to be making I'm not buying an apple car. I would definitely not buy an apple car
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.680]   So jason why not help when jason jason's the host all about android surely he can help
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.320]   getting you an android car
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.080]   Who is it? You can pick you one. I was pretty sure that that
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:26.680]   VW outy was doing android car. I you know doing some but not all the models so you
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   Yeah, exactly. I don't know that there's been like far and wide support by very many manufacturers and to be completely honest
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.000]   I've completely lost track and rate auto
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.640]   Yeah, I don't know. I just feel like it's it's one of one of many google efforts
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:48.600]   That's just kind of maybe there existing kind of sort of for the people that really have enough energy to seek it out and find it
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.000]   it's on various models of outy and folks wagon and
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.400]   Hunt and I and I take one other
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   Well, you can't wait till you see one on the showroom floor that does it and then you'll know that's the model
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.600]   My car is dying. Oh, you need that later Jeff?
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.880]   Couldn't you have no you don't want to have a question I have you don't want to do it
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.560]   That's the question I have but the problem is no because because detroit is detroit metaphorically speaking is such a mess
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.840]   That they don't make things modularly. They don't make them obtainable at all
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:24.600]   So so the hardware the nav screen hardware which might look the same and could be the same and should just be modular isn't
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:30.120]   And so they can't do it over the air up or update the way of course Tesla can test is built that way
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.800]   I can't afford a Tesla
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.400]   Yet
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.840]   Yet, well Tesla have Android auto. No, they're coming down. Oh, they have their own 17 inch screen with right?
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.320]   It's Tesla auto. Yeah
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.520]   I'm on the list
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.760]   I am I game for you $5,000. I feel like there's kind of a commitment over which bottle for the x
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.160]   Yes, well, I want doors that go like this that doors that go like
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:05.160]   It was you know the falcon wing or whatever that is go all ends your when's your estimated time in line?
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.160]   I think uh
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:12.600]   Well, my lease runs out on on the outy in october and I think that's exactly when supposedly
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.920]   I won't be able to what's the base price for those suckers?
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.800]   Well, they say like 75,000 but as soon as you put like a steering wheel and tires on it
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.360]   Yeah, it goes a well over a thousand
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.560]   But i'm not gonna buy it. I I just lease it
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.920]   Yes, I I don't want to make a big commitment
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.160]   So we'll see but one of the reasons I was one of the things I was waiting for I wanted to have solar
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.560]   Panels on the house
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.520]   So we have that now and the solar just got turned on are you buying a Tesla battery?
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.920]   And i'm on the list for the new uh, Tesla battery
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.960]   Oh, but you don't need that that's not you know, that's no, but it's all
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:59.640]   I would like to be off the you know, independent if in case of zombie apocalypse. I would like to be able to
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.200]   And we have a well so it's electric so I need you know if i'm gonna have water
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.800]   I need electric I need to rely on electricity. So so this the the
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:14.200]   Home powerwall whatever that is will be will mean that I can keep that charged and run the house at night
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.680]   So, uh, yeah, it's kind of cool. We got 60 60 which is a lot solar panels on the roof
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.120]   Wow, I know is this one of those cases where did you buy them?
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.960]   Nope, I don't own them
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   You don't know solar city, baby
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.520]   Did you have to put solar panels on your Tesla as well?
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:37.160]   I will and a friend who had a fisker with solar panels on it. Really? I think the thing bursts into flames
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.760]   It's actually they were they were
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.800]   I think I could tell this story
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.320]   They were uh going to the Oscars in their fisker
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:52.440]   His name's john lasseter. Yeah, I think one in Oscar that night and
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.400]   They the car like stopped opening
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:03.320]   In a minute. No, I'm trying to remember where they I think
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.400]   Anyway, it paid. Yeah, they had a massive computer malfunction
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:13.080]   And they were I don't know if they were trapped in it or out of it, but it just didn't wow so the fizz
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.400]   By the fisker went bankrupt. Mm-hmm
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.080]   So no, we went to solar. So this is actually kind of nice
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.960]   No money upfront
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.480]   Because they own them
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:29.240]   Right all you have to do is say yeah, we'll buy but you do with here's what you're agreeing to buying power from them instead of
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.760]   the local electrical company for 20 years
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.960]   But you had and you have two choices now
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.680]   We pay a lot for electricity in california and because we use a lot of power in the house
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:47.720]   We were going up to the third tier the highest tier, which was I think 56 cents a kilowatt hour or something outrageous
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:51.080]   You know almost immediately we get right up there
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:58.520]   So you can either say I will pay 15 cents an hour kilowatt hour to solar city with cost of living increases
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.560]   Or I will lock in 18 cents an hour
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.360]   For 20 years. So we just did that 20 years. Yeah, wow
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.200]   And we're still in the house. Well, that's part of the issue they own it
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.000]   So when you sell the house you have to get the new owner to sign on to agree
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.040]   Or buy the panels outright
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.360]   um, but
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.920]   So this only makes sense really if you're gonna be in the house, you know
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:29.080]   And I we'll be planning to staying in the house for 20 years. So doesn't the musk family don't they own solar cities?
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:34.200]   Cousins just yeah, it's cuz brothers something like that. Yeah, it's a family. He's on the board
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:39.960]   And that's why the power wall, you know, I can I can uh, get an inner side track on that
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:45.240]   But this is this was good. They cost us nothing. They installed 60 panels. They maintain them
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.720]   They they guarantee them they'll upgrade them if they need to basically get they get the tax credit
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.960]   They get the benefit, you know, they get the cheap power
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   And then they sell it back to us
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.760]   But if I put in the big battery it goes through that and if the you know, pge
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   Fails I could still run my house off of it
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.640]   How long?
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Well as long as it's sunny
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   The power wall will run the house overnight
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:14.360]   But if it's if it's rainy for a few days, I don't know I think you know
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.520]   I think i've got a gas generator. Yeah, well, I would get one of those and I think
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.840]   In the pacific northwest
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.560]   Yeah, I mean, we're very lucky we're in an area where there's lots of sun
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.320]   But it's interesting you know, by the way
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.080]   You know that google deal we showed that in a very limited number of areas you could see what
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.040]   Uh, whether whether solar would make sense and where you put the panels and all that remember google did that thing
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.640]   Apparently they for solar city they do it everywhere
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.320]   So he was able to show us our house even though we weren't in that google experiment
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.680]   He was able to show us and place the panels and see what they expected
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.080]   My house doesn't face the right way
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.560]   You know, and then the future every damn house of the world is gonna have to face now
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.280]   Have to face well, you can just put them on a pole, right?
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.240]   Yeah, and you don't have to put them on the house. Although that's how solar city does it, but uh, you could put them outside
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:04.040]   I'm really pleased we did it. Uh, it's there any zoning problems. Uh, uh
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.920]   If you drive around sort of rural
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.640]   Certainly in ontario
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.560]   A lot of the old farms that aren't being used. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:20.200]   They're they're just fields and fields of solar panels. So today we where there were cows now there's yeah
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.800]   Right. So you can see this is cool. You could see how much power you're uh, you're produced
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.040]   So today we did 15.2 kilowatt hours
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.920]   Yesterday was a little bit of a better. Uh, oh no wasn't because it was cloudy and rainy
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.720]   So and you could see you know, you know, you could see which days are the best days the best day we had
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.440]   Up to now was an 80. We produced 80 kilowatt hours total the best day
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.240]   We had was 15 kilowatt hours and we're close to that. We're actually gonna must have been a sunny day today
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.240]   Isn't that cool? But this is this has been a very rainy period. So this is not
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:56.360]   There's no real way to store it though. I guess not without that big battery. So what happens is they
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.680]   And this is really the local utilities don't like this because they they're in the power plant business
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.360]   So phoege and he took their time
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:13.320]   They dragged their feet getting the day and they say you can only get as much capacity as you currently use you can't
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.000]   Overbuild
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   When you want to overbuild
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   Allowed oh
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.680]   Uh-huh
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.600]   So uh, but if you so much more strain of trade, I think so
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:30.040]   I think they're afraid you you would sell it back into the grid. Yeah, they don't want you to get in the power. It's business
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.640]   right
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   That's screwed up
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.440]   That should be anti trust shouldn't it should be but there it's a it's screwed up is what it is
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.840]   Because you want to set up your own power utility
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:48.600]   Yeah, it's in the nation's interest. It's in all the globe's interest that as many people as possible put renewable power sources on their roof
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:55.480]   And if I wanted to put 120 panels, I should be able to do that. Mm. Yeah can't do it
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.360]   Interesting, it's kind of a mess. Thank goodness though, and this is a big deal
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.760]   We were talking uh on twit about
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.480]   The appropriations bill which rammed through sissa will get to that a little bit
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.680]   Because it was a secret amendment, but one of the things the appropriations bill which did do that it's very good is renewed the solar credits
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:22.040]   So that's huge that may be even more important than in the global agreement in paris the paris accords
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.880]   Because uh it will really stimulate
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:32.360]   Uh the growth of solar in the us big time it it definitely did in an ontario. I think the only problem was they
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.080]   They actually gave away
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.280]   more
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.200]   Than they got so I think it actually wound up not being a great
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.840]   Thing for the province
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.240]   But great thing for people
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.480]   You put up solar panels are getting
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:54.360]   Cheap power at some point we really need to kind of align the interests of government and the interest of the globe
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.520]   You know, let's think long term
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.640]   Shouldn't be that hard shouldn't be that hard you wouldn't think
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.440]   Um, yes, this is sissa basically is now going to be the the law of the land the
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:16.520]   computer information sharing act because they couldn't get it through in public. So what they did is they attached it as a
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.880]   Yeah, rider in the 50,000 page
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.360]   Appropriations bill, that's how all good legislation gets through right? Mm-hmm
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.160]   It's kind of a mess up here in the united states. We don't have the line item veto
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.840]   So a president can either pass the bill in its entirety or the whole thing, right?
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.640]   And you know or turn it down in its entirety and of course this bill was one bill
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.680]   You can't say no to because without it the government shuts down
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.360]   So we're gonna be getting sissa
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:53.480]   That means that super everybody like facebook and microsoft and apple can freely share your information with the federal government without fear of retribution or lawsuit
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.440]   Yay
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.840]   Good, sorry you're on good for your own good. We're all safe. We're all just a little bit safer now
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840]   I
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.880]   Speaking of safer, yes
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:12.440]   Sure, yeah, you explained to me. Can you explain to me how well the google password free login is going to work?
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.600]   Mm-hmm
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.240]   I haven't got it yet. Only some people get it by invitation only and the idea is we never get invited
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.600]   We didn't we had to do make a show about I don't want to be invited to this one
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.760]   Yeah, you did it first. So here's the deal. You know already now when you
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.200]   Sign into google through an app sometimes instead of getting the full login page name and password
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:41.080]   You just get the name. You know the email part. You enter the email and then it loads the email password part, right?
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.720]   Yeah, well now we know why
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.560]   Because in the future you'll just enter the email
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.840]   Hit return your phone will go. Oh
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.240]   Somebody just tried to log in as you is that okay and you'll say oh, yeah
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.200]   And now the login's done. There's no password. Okay
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.040]   So it's a push notification that you then
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.840]   Except yeah, well they require you do you think to use to party? Well, it isn't too fact or a super
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.880]   Too fact or I mean not too fact or anymore. It's single phone
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:18.680]   Well, oh, so okay, so there's no single factor single factor. So then if someone has your phone, right?
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.480]   Yeah, uh, you know who's been doing this actually is microsoft. There's a microsoft app
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.600]   You can download that instead of logging into your microsoft account. You get a pat a push
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.400]   It's very convenient
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.600]   But it does it's essentially not too factor. It's single factor. It's no longer something you know though. It's something you have
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.320]   Yeah, now one hopes that people and I think this is probably why google thinks is okay
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.480]   You know if your phone is fingerprint protected or you have password detected
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.320]   It's not still not too factor
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.960]   But it is at least at least somewhat more secure because you they would have to have your phone and be able to get into it
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.480]   and what if your phone is stolen you still have a password backup or
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.680]   Yeah, I'm sure they'll have some
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.880]   run around
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.840]   I have to say the two factor like I've got two factor for
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.920]   Google all my google stuff. I've got two factor for dropbox. I've got two factor for
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.120]   WordPress and slack to I think
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.880]   um and it I mean it adds another whole layer of
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.960]   of kind of
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.280]   Complication when you so you're at a different computer and you want to log into your gmail
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.720]   You have to get out your authenticator app and then you have to type in the
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.320]   long password and or whatever the number and maybe
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.800]   You know you got to it just as the number was changing so then you have to do it again
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.240]   And I can see why a lot of people don't do it because it's too cumbersome do it
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.520]   Yeah, I definitely do it. I think it's worth it
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.400]   uh, I'm more and more of the uh increasingly of the opinion that uh
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.480]   We're more vulnerable than we realize two factor everywhere
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:58.360]   I you know this isn't a bad the reason google's doing this and the reason microsoft does it and the reason yahoo is doing it
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:05.480]   Because the password system is horribly broken screwed. Yeah, because most people use the same password everywhere
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.560]   It's not a good password to begin with
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.000]   For years and it's written down on a sticky note that's attached to their computer. That's actually not so bad
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.600]   Really because you somebody'd have to have physical access to your computer
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.320]   I mean, it's not good in an office, but it's fine
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.480]   You know if you had a notebook at home that had all your passwords that wouldn't be the end of the world
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.840]   No
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:30.680]   Um if they were good passwords, but that's the real problem. They're not and they're using the same password over and over again
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.680]   And it's one two three your last name or
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.880]   Highly they're always here for eight right
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.960]   So it's just a passwords are a bad bad system. It's something we never had the only i was thinking about it
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.800]   This is talk about the Gutenberg parenthesis. This is the password parenthesis
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.520]   We didn't have to have password the only thing you had to remember was your locker combination in school
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.280]   Right and your phone right? Yeah your address
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.160]   Yeah, your address when you were really little
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.440]   Where do you live tommy?
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.560]   You're not telling you one two three monkey street
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.920]   Had a hard time because we moved so much my dad was in the air force so we moved every
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:16.200]   Like 18 months two years. So this was new addresses all the time. This was vital information. Yeah, it was hard
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.440]   Matthew what's your dress now? I have no idea. I don't know. Where do you live? I'm either
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.960]   I'm either toronto or vancouver. I'm not sure
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:34.440]   Uh, so somebody does have it reverend anonymity says he has it he's having it's pushed to his phone
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.360]   It doesn't I have to say it does it is a lot more convenient if you have your phone and everybody seems to have their phone all the time now, right?
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.800]   Yeah
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.160]   and um
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.280]   That would just mean you really need to have a password protection on your phone or better yet a fingerprint
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.760]   It would be even better on the watch
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:58.760]   And you would need to have a remote wipe capability. So someone right gets your phone. Just one click wipe the whole device
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:06.360]   Well, we have that android device manager does that and apple does that with that so yeah
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.840]   I think this may I don't you know my when when yah who did it? I thought that's a terrible idea
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   But the more I think about it the more I realize it's not a terrible idea for the vast majority people who don't use that two-factor authentication
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.840]   And it's probably better than a crappy password and it's a lot better than that, right?
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:28.360]   Now I don't know if it can be intercepted somehow can there be a man in the office Steve Gibson is this broke after security now
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.360]   Yesterday, so I didn't give a chance to but like could you do a man in the middle on that?
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.360]   Passwords being sent by sms to the phone. Mm-hmm. Is it plain text?
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.440]   It's actually not a password. It's just a notification, but could you have intercept that and and you know, I mean
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.080]   I'm sure hackers are working on it as we speak. Mm-hmm
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:53.000]   Beatles are coming to cool music
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.280]   Yay
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.440]   Coming to everything is there anybody who doesn't own
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.280]   Yeah, is this really that big of the Beatles music by now? Well the problem was I own the wall
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.120]   You know an eight-track then is eight track and then yeah, no, I don't own them in seven days
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.080]   didn't you rip them though
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.240]   you know
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   I ripped all this CDs
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   I probably did back in my apple days, but now I'm on google. It's it's you know, I've got this many generations
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.200]   Well, and and if you're streaming
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.080]   You know streaming has taken over in a lot of ways for
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:33.960]   For sort of physical your music that lives in a specific place
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.720]   So it makes sense for them to be on there. So I was thinking about this
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.120]   I'm guessing number one that this is a new revenue stream basically and number two. It's a marketing
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.360]   Opportunity these kids today to discover
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   War beetles and then be able to do by yeah
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.200]   Spotify Apple music slacker title
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:00.360]   Microsoft's groove music rhapsody dzer. Mm-hmm Google play and amazon prime
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.960]   Was already on pandaora because pandaora you don't get to pick his radio the song
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   Yes radio you can pick the songs
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:14.760]   And of course you can always you can buy them on iTunes and elsewhere, but uh, what's your favorite service of those you two?
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:21.160]   I'm actually going back and forth between spotify and google play me too
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.080]   um
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.520]   Spotify
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   I think I mentioned before I got access
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.600]   Free because I have 85 different services with rogers communications and so they threw in spotify
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.000]   That's nice. So and there's three accounts. So my daughters are using it. I'm using it
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.800]   Why would you use anything else? That's great. Well, and I do I do like it. I do like the
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:51.160]   You know, it's pretty smart. Um, I like the UI good stations. I like you know what I love good stations discover weekly
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.280]   Do you have that Canada? Everybody mentions that but I don't think I've used it enough for discover
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]   To get smart enough about me
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.580]   But almost everybody I talk to mentions
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.080]   Discover weekly as being one of the key things they like about spotify
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.880]   So you look in your playlist section because it's a playlist generated every monday for you
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.680]   by spotify
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.960]   Uh, and it's based I guess yeah, I guess it is based on stuff you uh, you you uh,
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.400]   Listen to and I love it because it uses my picture as the health of mart. So I know it's got to be good
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.240]   It's really good though. I think they've done really well. I don't know how it
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.720]   I listened to it every monday. I it's I listen to it
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.080]   Because it's what's interesting is it's a mix of old and new. It's not just a discover new music thing
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.760]   Like the first one here is the rowing stones wild horses
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.000]   From which i'm looking for with google play. I wish google was better
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.640]   Like that's something they should be able to do. Yes. I uploaded something like 40 gigabytes worth of music
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.360]   to google play. I mean to and I you know, I would love them to sort of
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:03.080]   Munch that all together and then come up with some interesting recommendations, but so you don't get on spotify
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.920]   You don't get discover weekly in your playlists
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:11.400]   That's weird. Uh, I do but I don't think i've used I don't think i've done enough with spotify for it to
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:17.640]   To be postulated 30 song two hour playlist. I listen to it all the time. I love it
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.960]   It takes me a whole week usually to get through it, but I love it
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.680]   But I also use google play music and I pay for both of these. I don't get a freebie
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.240]   I play for both. In fact, I pay I pay morgue
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:33.640]   I just realized for spotify than normal because I bought it on iTunes. So spotify charges me 30 more
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.400]   Really because that yeah, I pay apples cut in addition
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:44.280]   Wow, I know have you tried apple music? Wow. I know that sucks. Yeah, I tried it for the three months
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.120]   But it's they're all the same. It's undifferentiated. There's there's yeah
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.520]   So the differentiators are things like this little things like the discover weekly playlist
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.920]   Uh google has songs though, which I really like which is great. Yep
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.640]   Um, so
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   What do you not have you not chosen jeff?
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:10.680]   I'm like a spotify better. I you know me i'm google google boy, but google's just not as smart about me as a spotify. Yeah, it's not
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.880]   I wonder if maybe they're just not putting the horsepower into it
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.560]   You know, I think they they've clearly got the you get google you get google now with youtube red, right?
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:28.680]   Yes, google play music. Yeah google plums with youtube red or vice versa and youtube music is coming as well
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.920]   Oh look recently played or added with the Beatles yellow submarine the white album sergeant pepper
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.880]   Oh, I guess they just wanted to make sure I knew
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.880]   I but these are the um, these are the songs the stations which are which are great. Uh, okay
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.040]   So entering beast mode is it that's an old songs of thing and then within that
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.880]   You say do you want rakas punk and garage rock epic and debutched party mixes pop punk pandemonium aggressive?
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:15:02.200]   Rock headbanging classic rock or greatest agro anthems and then within that you pick one of those and there's three more channels in there
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.640]   So songs that was so cool
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.720]   Well, this is songs as far as I could tell
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.440]   Yeah, I think it's all been integrated. Yeah
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.920]   So yeah, you just have to pick their mood
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.720]   um, I guess I you know I
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.840]   They're used to always be kind of like
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:25.720]   Maybe because I haven't listened to classical music or maybe christmas replaced it because I used to have like kind of a nice relaxing
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.840]   Maybe it's later in the day the first came out
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.480]   Yeah, it was free it was
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.000]   And it was just their original interface. I'm pretty sure it was just uh almost like a search
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.840]   box and you could and then it would kind of
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   um
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.200]   Spin up these kind of automated. Oh radio stations almost based on what you searched for
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.880]   I was like songs as well as pandaure. Don't you?
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.200]   It's not artist based it's more like style based or mood based
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.680]   I remember using pandaure. I used it a lot it and last fm
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.280]   um, and I was interested in the difference between
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.720]   The way that they did music, you know, personal recommendations as opposed to
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.320]   and social recommendations as opposed to algorithms, um
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:21.720]   Because pandaure was basically the the music genome, you know, so they would try and they were trying to build basically a database
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.600]   About music right that would understand things on a sort of molecular level
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.920]   And last fm was all about who you were connected to and what they liked and what your friends liked
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:39.480]   I also like i'm feeling lucky radio because it just reminds me the old yeah me too
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.800]   Right me too. And it's pretty good actually isn't I know you know, it's what's interesting
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.640]   It's different genre almost every time I do it. It uh, I don't know what I'm gonna get
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.680]   It seems to have a thing for bon jovi. I don't know
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.080]   That's you
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:58.600]   No, you can't that's how many bon jovi in my I literally have nothing see like i'm getting i'm getting now
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.560]   uh kind of an r&b hip hop thing
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:09.000]   I don't know why but this is all like r&b and hip hop see if I was from jersey or something I could understand them suggesting bon jovi
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.800]   Hey, no, we know you will like by jovi and you might as well just accept it everyone likes
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:21.000]   Everybody likes by the way. I will not use a music system that doesn't work with my google
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.520]   Chromecast audio. Yeah
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.960]   I'm just gonna say that's the main thing I do. That's the killer. Fine google play. Yeah, that's the killer
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   Chromecast. Yep
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.400]   So my rant here at this moment is all of my google play stuff is in my google plus
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.080]   A gmail account rest of my life is
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.880]   Oops and you can't move over play. Oh god
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.320]   That's frustrating that is a problem. It's really a jesus google
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:58.840]   How hard could that be it can't be that hard. Yeah, I think it's fairly hard
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.680]   I don't know that one of you is right
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.360]   I think it can't be it's just it's just an address
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.360]   I
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.400]   Think it's got to be hard stuff at that address over here
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.040]   No, it has to be hard because otherwise they would have done it or they would have done it by now
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.960]   They would have done it. They know you want it. No, they don't care. They don't care
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.000]   They don't there's five other people right now at google or her saying
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.520]   I keep explaining about that. We're never doing this
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.320]   Fixing it for you jimmy suck up to us all you want to wear our
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.040]   Ex we're not doing it. I don't think so. I think it must be hard
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:42.520]   Nothing's hard to google now youtube is doing spotlight stories
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:49.560]   This was a feature on the moto x that was underappreciated and continues to be so
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:56.200]   But there gets a 3d version. I'm surprised they didn't do a cardboard version of this. Oh, it's not a card
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.720]   I don't think is a car board. I thought it wasn't cardboard. Oh, maybe it is
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:05.480]   I thought it was just I think if you put on the cardboard, it'll be cardboard. Will it? Oh, okay. I think so
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   Has to be because otherwise you have to do it manually, right?
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:16.120]   It's on I don't think you can move around here. Can you you have to use the phone to move around? Yeah, this is preview only
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.920]   It works with gear VR
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.520]   And it works. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, all right. Go. Yeah, I think so
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.400]   Okay
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.880]   It must work with cardboard. What would be the what would be the point? It's very cute
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.000]   Those are some of the things I like about google
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.040]   I don't know if that was a 20 times thing, but stuff like that that doesn't really I don't know
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.120]   it's more
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.520]   For fun. It's yeah, it's less kind of I love the fun stuff world and
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.560]   Yeah, the google doodle was that's how they lull you in
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:55.720]   licensee Matthew right those evil google people if you're gonna be skynet
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.320]   How would you get people to like you look at this shiny thing?
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.440]   That's how
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:08.440]   It's taken over sannehans pay no attention to the evil genius behind the curtain
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:15.560]   I liked it. That's a wall look at that whole thing is wall. There's no street out. It's like the facebook camp. Oh my god
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.760]   This is this is a metaphor for google land
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.960]   You can't get out
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.520]   There are no windows and no doors
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.800]   Now there's a little passageway there
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.920]   There you go. Are they control it? You can't get out of it, but there's a passageway there
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:40.760]   But now I don't oh, there's you have to use your phone if you use your phone you can move around
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.600]   Yeah, you're look around but you can do it with your hands. Yeah, I'm grabbing still video. Okay. Okay
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.800]   And you see the idea is you look at what's going on. It's going around here
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:56.920]   I'm gonna bring on my cruise on this boat. I'm gonna bring my theta s my rico theta s three three to sixty degree immersive rizio
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.440]   I'm gonna vlog

[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.160]   Yeah, but it's all the same it doesn't oh, I see what you're saying like the like the
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.280]   cardboard camera actually has the 3d yeah, but i just have one lens so it won't be 3d
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.720]   But it'll kind of feel like it because you can look around and you can look up and down
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.120]   Yeah, i'll do the room. I'll do the you know i'll do all that different stuff so you can see it

[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.400]   The dog spark and let me stop that. I was watching the
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.760]   1989 super bowl this morning
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.960]   On the nfl channel the Niners and the Bengals a great memory for Niners fans

[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.960]   And I thought I thought this was new

[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:21.400]   That was 25 years ago or 3d how long were 3d TVs in the store half an hour a year and a half? Yeah, maybe

[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.360]   No, I don't the worst thing is every once in a while the tv will say I see 3d content
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.760]   So by the way, this is from the 1989 super bowl. Here's bob costus
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:57.800]   Wow a word from our sponsor. Hold your breath america. It's the first commercial ever in 3d

[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:25.880]   Now apparently we're not seeing this in 3d because it but I guess if you were that coke machine would be menacing
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.880]   in past year almost two million families had made the move away from regular fashion
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.800]   Wow that's some high quality right there

[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.480]   Best Android apps of 2015
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.440]   Now of course google has their own pick

[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:20.680]   The one that doesn't even deliver things the uh, this is this is business insiders pick as no
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.080]   It says no, you're right. It's weird. I don't get it jet
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.640]   That's the amazon clone that raised a lot of money, but I don't know anybody uses it
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.000]   Um
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.560]   Google docs
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560]   You don't wonder if maybe
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.520]   Google had some vested interests in some of these choices
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.800]   doodle schedule maker never even you
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   Alaban android host i've never heard of Jason. How have you ever heard of doodle schedule maker
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:53.080]   Schedule maker or is this i put this one up i might be wrong. Maybe business insider doing something funny
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.760]   No, I mean they say every year the editors at google hands lights
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.480]   By the way, that built the top pick the editors at google what editors at google
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.280]   Is there editors at google hire me as a robotic dog
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.920]   Microsoft the end of the world. This is a joke, right? Jessica Jones was good
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.280]   Zedge ringtones and wallpapers this has to be paid placement. I use that no don't
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:22.280]   Okay, my strong recommendation is never ever ever use a third party wallpaper or ringtone app
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:28.600]   Because half of her malware, maybe not zedge, but problem is I couldn't get a decent ringtone. How do I get a ringtone?
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:35.880]   I'll just give you a lesson someday any mp3 could be a ringtone
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.560]   Actually, I know but I was trying to go through the android nest to get it and I finally gave
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.880]   Oh, you just connect your phone to your computer and mount the disc as a as a
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:51.000]   Storage and then copy it over you ringtones folder and that's pretty much it. All right. Yeah ringtones are easy on android
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.600]   Uh youtube gaming interesting. How many youtube product? I mean google products made it into their editors choice. Well twitch is on there twitch
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.120]   That's the other one
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:06.680]   Hungry caterpillar. Uh-huh. That's good action launcher. See not my favorite launcher, but at least that's a popular launcher
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.920]   That is a pretty popular. No vote is my favorite, but okay. Bisco cameras good
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.480]   Choice of boring is the this is a classic children's book
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.760]   Yep, and it's free
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.600]   Caterpillar. I very hungry caterpillar. You never read that to your kids Eric
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.480]   It's a great one never for all. Yeah, I was that book
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.960]   He by the way spoiler he turns into a butterfly
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:37.880]   Oh, I'm not ever watching twiggin again. Thanks a lot. Oh
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.520]   I will get a tweet to that effect
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.920]   I got a tweet from somebody said you spoiled star wars
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   Before I'd seen the movie
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:58.920]   Maybe somebody's just it's very easily spoiled. I'll go easily spoiled. I'll spoil it for you. What you didn't like it
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.240]   You didn't like it
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.960]   You didn't like it. I thought I was gonna be an actual spoiler
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.800]   No, you know what? I'm gonna say something about that and it will not be a spoiler
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:13.960]   I felt the same way, but that's not the point it's star wars and they're back and it doesn't matter if it's
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.200]   man
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:22.600]   It's still great better than is it better than the last three? Yes. Okay. That's that what what a high bar that is
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.040]   Yes, I know it's low bar, but I think it's the second best star wars movie ever made
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.920]   That was the sort of consensus among my friends. They've lost so many
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.920]   Develop character and conflict. It just didn't do. I love the characters
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:44.040]   Oh, I liked it a lot. I'm gonna go see it again. So screw you Jarvis in 3d
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:50.280]   Jarvis now I saw 3d and now I've seen the bebop the Lux. I've got it's too high a bar. I'm gonna have to see it 2d
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.040]   I
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.600]   Had to see it in 3d and I regret it now. I want to see I sort of resent the 3d
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.920]   Like some movies
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.920]   You can't even find them in regular D
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.320]   To go for 3d I know and then the movies all muddy and dark
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:10.920]   Right and there's one scene where something lunges out of the screen at you and that's it. Thank you. Right
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.800]   So you paid twice as much for that. I know
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.160]   And these would be glasses
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.800]   Yeah
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.400]   Inside out thought bubbles man. This is an interesting list as I'm scanning
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.360]   I maybe heard of half of these which is not
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:31.640]   To say that the apps that I haven't heard of aren't good. It's just there's a lot in here that wow
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.000]   I would just pick them. You would do so much later. Apparently I need to scan through this and pick some apps where I show
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.320]   No, I disagree each week
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   The Android and have your arena
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.120]   If you just picked the balls good the winner each week from all about android
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.200]   I am is pretty good. Yeah, light room light rooms good. Yeah
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:57.400]   Mason, are you gonna keep doing android? Oh, yeah, all that android and android app arena sticking. Oh, good. Okay. Definitely still doing that photos
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:04.520]   Arguably the best app of the year of any kind anywhere on ios or android stories
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.880]   Robinhood once you turn in the stock trader for free
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.320]   Let's you buy and sell stocks without a trading fee that had a big a big thing behind it when it when it hit
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:21.320]   It was an ios app for a longest time and it finally got its android release and I don't know there's a star wars app
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.640]   I didn't even know Microsoft office lens lens is cool lens is cool
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:32.120]   Because you can take pictures of while as she's doing of a whiteboard or and depending on like if you're angled like that
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.520]   And you take that picture then when it adds to your camera roll straightens it out and does all this
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.320]   Do it doesn't recognize no
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.080]   No
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:41.880]   No
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.400]   Flip a gram
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.920]   Swift key is great. Swift key. The is the only choice no volonzo
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.440]   Yep
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:53.240]   Pics are actually flip a gram. I've heard is pretty good. Yeah, some of these are good. DJ is good. Yeah
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:58.360]   Backgrounds hd. I don't know memorize learn language is free. I don't know b&h
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.320]   This is an ad for a app for a photo store
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:08.440]   Yeah, I mean bh is a button seduction and from what I understand that app is notable because it's designed really really well
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.800]   Okay, it's got a really nice. I should get it because I spent a lot of money there
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:17.000]   Wait too much money there hbo now office dash lane
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.240]   Toka to call the toka
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.600]   What was that dash lane any good show time?
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.360]   Uh
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.560]   Last pass
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:30.360]   Dash lane is okay. I use one pass one password. It lasts past number one one passes number two
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.960]   hm
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   in my opinion
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:39.160]   What makes last pass better? Oh my god start using it. You'll know okay
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:45.640]   Um, it's just really uh, they've done everything right the only reason we're worried about last passes because they were acquired
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.120]   Um a couple of months ago by bad people
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.960]   Well log me in not the greatest people log me in yeah
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.760]   Wow, I know
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:01.640]   But the guy who created last passes still there we had we interviewed him on security now and um
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.000]   I said look i'm gonna get to use last pass as long as you're still there
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.600]   But if if things go south and you quit that's assigned to me
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.160]   Yeah, log me and is not big a steward of the of the program and I will bail
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:18.120]   So that's one of the reasons I've tried a dash lane in one password and all the other ones is just to be ready
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:23.160]   But uh last password is soon you won't need passwords, right? Maybe not
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.240]   Do you do phone god knows it was they were a bad idea or something
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:32.120]   So what's what so so while we're on that one more quick. Uh, what's his name? Who's the the crazy security back of he?
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.520]   Yeah, so he's on
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.880]   Um, I mean, would you trust him give me this cycle?
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.000]   He's on uh kickstarter or indigo
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.040]   Security thing. I don't know
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.560]   You seen it. You know what his business last business was
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.360]   making bath salts
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   And I don't mean the kind you get in the tub with
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   Yes
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.920]   All right
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.440]   And running for president, right? Yeah, he's building a hundred dollar gadget to
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:03.000]   Quote block the nsa
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.040]   Right
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:11.560]   There's a smartphone design. You know what there are good solutions. It's called the fr uh, is it
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:19.000]   No, this is something else. There's other people doing some more things. Uh, it's it's he's on kickstarter or central
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.640]   It's called. I'm like let me google it
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.640]   I'm like
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.480]   Decentral future titch central.com
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:36.600]   Pray, you know, is it a vpn? What is it? I don't know. No, it's a little device. And if you hold it near things, oh, please
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:46.840]   Sounds fake, but I got a bracelet if you wear it, you won't get arthritis. Yeah, it's magnets
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.680]   Um, yeah, no, I if you if you ever jeff if you want to get secure
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:02.840]   Let me know we have a show all about it. Oh, I know all the tricks and tips. It's what got me to do to two factor
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.200]   It's it's you know, I actually I recommended this on them
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:13.000]   And I wish I'd gotten it in time for a cruise. I recommend this on mac break weekly. It's called the tiny hardware firewall
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.240]   And it's a little device and you travel enough you probably should get one it's this big
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.920]   And it makes all your traffic vpn traffic so you use it when you're in an open Wi-Fi access spot
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:29.560]   It'll pick up the signal you can either connect it directly to your computer or have it have it be a Wi-Fi access point for up to four devices
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.400]   But it but it puts it all through a vpn and if you wish tour
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:40.200]   And so is it have a cellular connection? Is it? No, no, no, you know, it uses the Wi-Fi at the open Wi-Fi access point
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:47.560]   Okay, it's powered, you know directly via usb plug it in your machine or you could use a little battery dongle
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:54.840]   And the thing is it's free the hardware is free if you buy a year's worth of vpn for 91 bucks from this company hot spot vpn
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.880]   So I bought it. I'll give you a report
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:03.480]   But I wanted to use it on the ship because you can only use public Wi-Fi on the ship. That's your own choice, right?
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:09.720]   So usually what i'll do is i'll use my phone if i'm on an open hot spot i'll just use my phone and that's that's fairly secure
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.840]   uh as a hot as a hot spot
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.000]   but um
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   This is the Wi-Fi on the ship
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   a
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.960]   But I bought
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:30.200]   No, it's not that bad actually it's better than um, I think it was I want to say for the week 65 bucks per device
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.880]   So it's not too bad. Well, it's not like hotel Wi-Fi. Yeah
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:39.800]   Um, but it's supposed to be very fast because again, this is and one of the reasons we're going out of New Jersey
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.360]   So I can go on this high tech ship. It's all about the it's got a robot bar tender
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.560]   Stuff like that. I want to try the high techery
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:55.160]   But it's supposedly and I've heard from a number of people who've sailed royal caribbean on these boats and they're supposedly it's very fast internet
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.880]   Which is on unheard of at sea
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:03.560]   So i'll let you know, but I do I don't think i'm gonna get my tiny hardware firewall in time
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.800]   Got one more day
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:09.080]   And you know health terms it's just about the same as eating chipotle. So
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:15.960]   Notice you haven't mentioned chipotle a lot lately. Yeah, there is javis. I'm not going
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.760]   I look at play and I say what are you doing in there folks? I'm not going in until they figure it out
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.200]   That's kind of too bad. I miss it. I really miss it
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.240]   I think it's a great thing to come home and get one on the way home and it's your food
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.880]   Guac but
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:37.240]   The business week has a big cover story. It's all I was starting to read it. It's I think a devastating isn't so it's like it's it's it's
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.840]   Not merely to bad stuff that got in this like there's a
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:47.000]   They can't get to the bottom of it. So it's it's the it's the cover of business week. So that's not gonna be good. It's not good
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.760]   Uh, india says hold on there internet.org. We want to make sure
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.400]   And others are starting to say now that the facebook's idea to bring internet
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.440]   to uh developing world that can't afford high-speed internet
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.480]   For free is really not
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.440]   Well, it's controversial. It's really just facebook. Yeah, not the internet
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.160]   Uh, india's telecom regulator has asked the service be disabled
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:22.760]   While it investigates whether it poses a threat to net neutrality, you know, we need it. We need a we need an FCC like that
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.840]   Well, yeah, why don't we have an FCC like that g Comcast and t mobile? You can't give away
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:36.360]   Special services for special prices in particular the regulators concerned about whether phone carriers should be allowed to charge different prices for different
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:42.360]   Content in this case free for some websites like facebook zero rating. Yeah
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:49.800]   Zero rating that's what it's called. Yeah, it's a it's a fascinating topic. I had a long conversation with someone
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.480]   um
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.840]   Who's who's indian about whether it's better
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.440]   For people to have a kind of dumb down
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.320]   you know sort of
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.200]   Walt garden version of the internet then no internet or would it be better
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:12.120]   You know if they just if you can't have the whole internet then you just get no internet
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.440]   And it's not actually an easy question to answer
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.360]   um
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.360]   so if you
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.320]   You know, if you say well facebook shouldn't do this
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.520]   Then lots of people are just going to have no internet at all. Listen to what you get. I agree with you from afio
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.240]   I think it's it's not an easy it's complicated. Listen what you get
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.320]   In india, you get facebook facebook messenger, but you also get bbc news wiki pedia
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.480]   Bing
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.160]   Accuweather
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.320]   sites dedicated to infant health and malaria prevention 30 sites total
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.040]   They're customized to the location
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.160]   Indian news sources for instance
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.120]   um and and facebook wants to bring this to other places like uh,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.800]   It doesn't african countries middle east latin america asia pacific
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.760]   Yeah, would you rather have that or nothing?
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.480]   Right. I got to say my first response was
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.640]   Well, you know, this is just facebook trying to create a little wall garden and it selects the sites that it wants
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.880]   And it plays nice with the phone companies and and all of that is true, but
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.840]   it also is giving people access to
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:24.520]   Things that are valuable for nothing. So and and the key to what I think is this the guard the
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.440]   To me it's a governance question
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.320]   That it's the same problem with with amp and google
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:35.880]   If you're going to say it's open and you've got to make it open if anybody who wants to join and the reasonable conditions joins
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.040]   um
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.040]   Now the problem becomes that
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:46.120]   That then big guys can all join and be free and make out money and I start an indian startup comes in and can't afford
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.720]   Terms, that's where the issue comes in if it becomes
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.120]   restraint against
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.320]   newcomers
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:58.040]   That would be my issue, but at some level. Yeah, it's is something that's limited better than nothing
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.960]   You can have the article about google and china by the way gee
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.840]   It was a limited google better than no google and there I said no
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.680]   Uh, don't go along with the authorities in that case very different situation
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.000]   Limitations being better than the whole the internet is a whole
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.600]   It's supposed to be any point to any point this person I was talking to said, you know, you
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.320]   I mean your
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:28.920]   You live a privilege privilege life in north america and you get high speed internet and can access whatever you want because you can afford it
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.200]   Um, you're probably not the best person to say
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.200]   Is this a good thing or not because obviously to you it's not a good thing
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.680]   But to some people who you know, they've got a
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:43.080]   A dumb phone, you know, they've got no internet at all. Maybe this
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.160]   Sort of watered down version is better and I agree with you jeff it'd be better if
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.720]   If facebook wasn't the one
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.560]   Choosing who gets to be part of it if they opened it up more in some way or if maybe there was some kind of
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:02.680]   I don't know advisory board or something. So it wasn't just facebook saying here's facebook's version of the internet, you know, if I
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.720]   I'm all in favor of this if they give you a wiki pd
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.760]   You don't have to look at facebook
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:15.080]   Yeah, and uh, if they if somebody just came along and said I will give you uh free unlimited access to wiki pd
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.800]   That's a good thing
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.320]   And even though twit is not included in that bundle
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:26.120]   I still a good thing, but I don't think that's any competitive
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.320]   uh
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.320]   I think that's a good thing and
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.200]   If it weren't mark zuckerberg and facebook, I don't think there'd be this kind of criticism of it
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:41.960]   If somebody came along and said if the eff came along and said look what we want to do is give people the free access to a wiki pd
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.400]   and some malaria sites and uh
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.800]   Anacu weather and bbc news for free
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.760]   Nobody would say oh, that's net a violation of the trial and he'd say yeah great. Thank you eff
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.840]   And actually if it was google if it was google people would probably say oh, that's great. Maybe thanks. Good. Maybe
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:05.400]   No, let's say it's a non-profit. Let's say it's a non-profit doing this. Well, let's say it's an NGO
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.680]   Wouldn't everybody say oh great
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.080]   Not they wouldn't say oh, but where's all the other parts of the internet? They'd say oh great
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.560]   Do you get access to google or is it just bang?
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.960]   Yeah, it looks like it's just banging. I don't know why they mentioned being but this so you search bang or you search even if the google's there
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.680]   Everything you search on is not free. Right. You'd find a bunch of sites that you couldn't go to for free
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.200]   So so so that's where wall gardens wikipedia facebook and so on complete things
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.680]   Yeah, are the best but that's exactly the problem. But do this thought experiment
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.800]   What if we're the eff offering facebook facebook message or bbc news wikipedia being an acu weather
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:48.040]   Let's take fixbook out so you don't have to include that when you say yeah right on eff good job
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:55.800]   Thank you. Next question. What if mountain or mtn phone service in africa a huge phone company there
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.120]   Did the same thing so Comcast we're getting mad at and team up what we're getting mad at for doing
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.760]   Uh, what do you call zero?
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.120]   Zero rating so what if what if a phone?
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:12.120]   Similarly a telecommunications company in africa or india or south america did the same thing. What's your it's only a good
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.720]   thing if
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:18.360]   You're giving something to people that they can't otherwise get yes, that's i'm all i'm saying
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.560]   I mean it's not a good thing would never be a good thing in the us
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.200]   Maybe it would be
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.760]   Um, let's say you're in a rural area where you have no access to the internet
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.920]   Not because of poverty but just because you don't have any access because there's no access
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.600]   And somebody comes along and says well, I'll give you access but you only get five sites
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.960]   It's like why wouldn't you say yes to what's wrong with that?
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440]   I
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.080]   Disagree. I think this is a good internet that org is a fine thing. I think it's because it's from facebook
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.240]   And that everybody goes well facebook's getting a lot out of this well
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:54.760]   Yeah, they are of course they are because they're for profit company
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.000]   But I think this is a good thing
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.480]   are they paying
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.600]   the
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.600]   telcos that offer it
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.600]   I mean, I don't know. They must be doing the yeah, they must i'm pretty sure they are yeah, they must be paying for it
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.640]   You know, it's funny though facebook is the classic
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.600]   like their expertise is
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.400]   Is sort of foustian
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.520]   Yeah, I know I know because this is so good
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:23.160]   And it's such a positive thing
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.960]   And yet the fact that facebook is doing it must frustrate me feel like they're trying to
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:34.680]   You know, pull one over on the most frustrate mark because i'm sure it does even if he wants to do a good thing
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.440]   Uh, he can't because everybody presumes him to be evil. Okay. Here's the
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.280]   the john mackephie thing every key the master key
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.720]   Convenience makes security. What the hell is this? Can you figure this out?
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.760]   No, this is what happens when you smoke too many uh bath salts
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:03.080]   When every key is close to your phone laptop tablet house store card or or other access control device
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.080]   It unlocks that device when you walk away that device locks back down
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.480]   Every key can also log you into your website accounts. Oh, well, yeah, I can understand this
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:17.160]   There's it's like a ub key or something. Yeah, if you lose your every key you can remotely freeze it. Yeah, the sign is all right
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.720]   So, right, okay. Let's see the tv commercial
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.880]   So it's like those rsa key things. Yeah
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:29.480]   Hello there. I'm just inspiring john mackephie's carrying a mace
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.720]   Since leaving the company, I've become part of a bigger and better things. This is my new product every key
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.800]   This is my phone. I have to type a password into it a hundred times a day, but with this
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:47.160]   I never have to type another password again. It's not just the key to my phone or my laptop
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:55.240]   Mother f*cking hell. This is not just the key to my online account. No, it's with a key to my car. This is a tv commercial
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:03.720]   It's my every key. I am the man who's obsessed with security and so is every key. He's got a drag. Nothing is more secure
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:11.000]   And if I lose it, I can remotely freeze it. Show me another key that can do that. So it's your choice all of this
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.080]   Or just whatever you were just talking about, you know how passwords
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.680]   The evolution of access. Yeah, don't work. Let's look at the tech specs. See what uh so it because that's how I lose these little things
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.920]   So it's bluetooth
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.320]   Um
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.760]   I don't know by the way how you would wipe it if it's bluetooth
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.960]   Mm-hmm
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:37.000]   Because it probably checks into to the mothership and the mothership says not got any not via bluetooth
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.800]   Which is there has a 30 foot range. So you'd have to have it. It would have to be plugged into something
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:44.760]   Right
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:50.600]   Obviously there's something that has to be running on the computer
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:57.720]   And the phone they say it works with iOS to recognize it to recognize it and unlock it
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.480]   Yeah, you know what it's like uh, you know what it's like an android wear watch
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:07.080]   That um when when I have my android wear watch near my phone it unlocks it unlocks, right? Yeah
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:12.360]   I think there are a few holes in this i'd like to know about
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.920]   Yeah, I want to see here a security now on this one
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.240]   It's oh, hey, wait a minute now. I feel better. It's it says on the web page military grade military grade security
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.520]   Okay, sorry. I apologize
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:28.520]   By the way, that is the last refuge of the scoundrel
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.480]   military grade security
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.200]   When you read that immediately red flag
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:40.200]   So what military what do you mean military grade? What grade a bc? What grade is that?
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.200]   There's a big regions in toothpaste. There's a bracelet version. Yeah
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.720]   It uses a es 120 bit encryption
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.200]   That has been used by the military. Yes, it has
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.160]   So well the enigma machine was used by the military too, you know
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:03.480]   Uh, so yeah, some sort of weird bluetooth thing. Um, I'd like to see how that works. Uh, with
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.200]   Your laptop and with your phones
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:12.440]   Like how what what app would you have on your phone that could lock down an iOS device until it saw this device?
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.280]   There's a key that has everything's your how I mean if you want to get scared
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.520]   John McAfee has your connections everything that you have
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.280]   Oh, yeah, he says it's audited by a third party
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:28.120]   Is it my cousin vitty? Yeah
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:33.560]   Vitty says it's cool. I loved this story. I'm glad somebody linked to this, uh, according
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.600]   uh to uh
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:44.200]   Dw which you probably know what that is. This is a doge of valor doge of valor which is a government run
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]   media company educated german's
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.800]   Avoid social media
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.280]   An anomaly and go look at the chart. It's the old in all other countries
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   Educated people are index higher on social media than uneducated people except germany
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.160]   Why?
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.560]   I think paranoia is cool
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:09.640]   That is so weird. Isn't it? Yeah
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:17.720]   Yeah, Iceland is one of the few countries where both educated uneducated people spend 80 percent of their time on social media
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.040]   but in germany even
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.640]   Uneducated that is someone with no or low formal education
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:29.880]   Hmm only spends half his time or her time on social media if you have an education 40 percent
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.040]   why
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:35.240]   Because it's dangerous because I think it is the intellectual
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.880]   Goge to be it's becoming anti technology anti social anti
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:51.720]   Dr. Schutz data. I know they're very they're very security conscious. So I wonder if they just think do you think that some people are tracking them or maybe the legacy of
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.360]   nazi-chirmony and I know it's always the argument is this it's reasonable in history, but I
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:03.400]   My argument back is I think it's partly cultural my my grandfather in law and grandmother-in-law came from germany in
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.920]   23 and they're every bit as private as the german's. I know today
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.760]   um
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.880]   and
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:15.480]   But yes, that's certainly a factor. I don't you know shtazi and nazi. I don't deny them the files that they kept
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:25.000]   Do think that the kind of techno panic euro techno panic that is it is the well spring of it is germany
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.840]   Part of it is the interests of companies of action-springer and company who are otherwise brilliant brilliant media companies
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.960]   But they've fought google this way to the I think the harm of the country
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:39.080]   Part of its government regulation and a reflex for that
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:49.320]   Distrust of big american companies. It's a lot of factors this article says is it a sign that the well-educated in germany are simply
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:54.680]   Satisfied with their rustling newspapers weekly magazines and evening news programs
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:00.280]   I want to go back to that time. They also like they like big brands. They like institutions
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.520]   I want Walter Cronkite
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:06.920]   You know what I found fascinating at news guys. I don't know if we talked about this before but
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.920]   um
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:16.760]   Three publishers of three leading german newspapers said they're the use of ad blocking software in their
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:20.600]   Users was as high as 40%
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.920]   I found that amazing because I talked to a publisher
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:29.480]   I'm an Italian paper and he said ad blocking wasn't even on their radar
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.520]   And yet some german papers their users. Yeah the use of ad blocking software was 40%
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:38.040]   We had the makers of adblock plus on a german
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:42.120]   Ooh, how many that's widely used they said 41% in germany
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:47.960]   And I think so so someone explained that it was mostly security driven. It wasn't so much the ads
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.960]   It was the tractors and the data
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:57.080]   Yeah, because I think german's have been exposed to as many ads as anybody else. They're not adiverse, right? I don't know
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:02.840]   Well, I think this is this is part of the the anti-corporate too. Yeah
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.880]   I think they're smart
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.240]   I was waiting for that
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:14.040]   I think I want to abandon social media but social media has benefits
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:19.000]   It's people. It's not it's not it's just it's just people. It's people. It's made of people
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:23.480]   It's made of people the more I use twitter the more ever great. Yeah, they're annoying
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:30.840]   Yeah, well, I I the scariest technology imagine imagine I've seen is the story that's in about twitter and they're run down
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:37.960]   A drone controlled by twitter. I can't imagine a worse idea. I'll go here. I'll go there squirrel
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:42.280]   By the way, that was a patent application by twitter
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:44.360]   I know I doesn't mean they plan to do it
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:48.120]   Although if you've ever been to twitch.tv and watch their twitch has done it twice now
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.560]   They twitch plays pokemon. Yeah, I was just gonna mention that that was
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:58.280]   Exactly that which is all the people in the twitch tv chatroom are trying to issue commands so they can win. They finished it
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:03.400]   They won that was what was amazing. Did they but then the next one they did was twitch installs Linux?
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.320]   Oh, I didn't see that
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.160]   And I don't know if they ever finished that did they did they let me ask the chatroom because I'm sure they watched it's fascinating to watch
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:13.320]   Because it's two one step forward two steps back. It's like
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:19.560]   You know then there's and there's chaotic. There's there's all the elements of a role playing a game
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.840]   There's the chaotic element. There's the you know the the good
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:25.560]   the paladin
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:31.080]   And there's guys trying to do with the installation and there's a chaotic element who goes rm rf star
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:37.000]   It's pretty funny. Did they ever get uh, linux installed? I don't know
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.880]   I I feel like social media
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:42.360]   drains my uh
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.840]   Precious bodily fluids
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:50.760]   Really like a phrase. I feel like it sucks the life out of me
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:55.320]   Yes, really don't you feel worse after you look at facebook and twitter?
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.800]   No, actually, I don't you don't I maybe I don't know. Maybe I'm
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.480]   You may be following different people. Yeah, you found better people maybe
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:09.560]   I actually do find I mean, maybe it's because I work at home and I don't I don't get a chance to go into
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.800]   an office and sort of network with real live human beings
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:18.920]   I actually it's a lifeline for me. I spend a lot of time on there just having
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.280]   conversations with people about things. Do you?
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:27.000]   Yeah, do you read your at mentions?
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.480]   I do yeah, you do. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's the part I find draining
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:38.200]   Well, I still tell them all the time. Well, no, no, they're not all attacking me, but I click back and forth between
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.080]   reading them all and then reading just sort of the verified
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.720]   Mentions and then reading verified ones because sometimes there's a lot
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:54.440]   Um, but yeah, I look at them all I also find and maybe this is an age thing although you guys are old too
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:58.280]   Um, I can't understand what they're saying a lot
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:06.040]   Twitter the move to 140 characters has really meant that the tweets are especially because you laid them up with hashtags
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:08.360]   They're extremely cryptic. Yes
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.840]   They can be definitely
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:16.920]   And I mean I get into twitter fights or people. Oh, I've learned not to you know those those things
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.800]   But actually some of that stuff I enjoy it's uh, you like twitter. No, no
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.400]   Nothing good has ever come out of a twitter fight for me
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.320]   Nope, no, and I'm not talking about fight fights. I mean just like
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.040]   Just discussions are okay friendly debates, you know about a topic
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:38.600]   But they're almost always not satisfying because the person just if he if he loses just drifts away
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.200]   I want capitulation. Yeah, I guess
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:46.040]   I mean I do try to limit my time
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:52.760]   Because it can suck up basically all of your time. What's your preferred platform?
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.440]   You mean for twitter?
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.440]   No for what social network
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.800]   Uh, it's got to be twitter
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.640]   Really? Yeah, although I mean, I'm a big instagram fan as well
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.920]   I love instagram because it's just pictures. I don't read the comments
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:15.560]   And uh and and and facebook's interesting, but I always feel manipulated by facebook because they're always changing
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.640]   I know and it's apparent
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:20.200]   Like a friend of mine
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.240]   That was a family member
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.640]   Said I posted a bunch of pictures. Uh, oh no, it was it was my call screen
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:30.280]   I bought just a bunch of pictures from our new years, uh party
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:35.400]   I never saw them because facebook didn't deem them important. Yeah, but I see a lot of jeff javis
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:38.680]   Well, the other thing that happens is don't forget facebook is constantly refreshing
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:42.200]   So what you know, one of the problems about facebook is you go forward to read something you go back
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.320]   Try to get the same spot and it's not they refreshed it again
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:50.120]   So it's not just about saying oh, we're not going to show you that it's that we might have tried to show you that
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.120]   You know an hour ago, but uh
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.240]   That's that's that's that's that's warm beer now. I've been doing this
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:58.200]   Sort of social experiment where I ask
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:02.920]   Civilians is I like to call them or muggles people who don't you know
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:05.880]   Aren't into social media and don't understand
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:11.480]   Things but are you know relatively intelligent human beings. I will ask them whether they know
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.480]   the facebook
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:20.200]   Filters their newsfeed using an algorithm. Oh, I they don't so there are things that they don't see no and roughly 75
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.840]   Percent have no idea that that that that even happens. Yeah, so they're missing things
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.280]   But they have known they don't know that they're missing things
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.240]   They assume that they're seeing everything you can of course change your newsfeed to be chronological
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.840]   You can but then facebook changes it back doesn't stay that way. You're right. It changes roughly every
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.880]   It changes
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.800]   Let's remember to that there's something else though somewhere in this newsfeed about how people get news
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:47.960]   um
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.360]   The world's on facebook. They're not on twitter. We're on twitter the world's on twitter. Mm-hmm. The world's not on twitter
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:57.640]   No, uh for four and ten people get news from facebook one in ten get it from twitter
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:58.840]   Yeah
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:01.640]   And that's just the reality and actually 60
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:05.080]   60 percent of millennials
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:10.360]   Said that they that facebook is one is their primary or one of their primary news sources
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:19.320]   Yeah, I mean actually get it's funny because I do read uh, you know, I go to tech meme and nuzzle and uh
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:25.720]   Hacker news there's certain, you know beat checks. I do two or three times a day looking for news for these shows
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:28.040]   but I often get
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.280]   uh articles from facebook and google plus
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:33.320]   Hmm because of the people you follow and I guess
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.560]   Nuzzles mostly twitter so that i'm getting the twitter stuff from nuzzle
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.480]   um
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:43.800]   So there's definitely because of the people I follow and if I do it by the way if I do it chronologically
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.800]   It's much less interesting
[01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:50.520]   Yeah, if I let if I you know give in and let facebook do it. I do actually go back and forth
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:55.320]   It's interesting to see yeah, it's good to see it's very different
[01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:00.200]   Chronological means you're seeing everything. Yeah, it's everything in chronological order
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:06.280]   That's what it what used to be and they are giving you a bit more control that they started showing people
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.880]   um
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:13.800]   Who do you want to see at the top of your feed and so you can sort of pick oh if you know what you're doing scoble gave me a lesson
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.360]   If you know what you're doing you could totally
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.040]   You know for instance, uh, everybody lists a lot
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.640]   Yeah, but you don't even have to do that everybody that you follow
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.320]   Is either a close friend or an acquaintance they're different
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.280]   Categories of friendship and if you make somebody in acquaintance, you'll see less of their stuff
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:36.040]   Here's the signal to you're signaling facebook all the time about what you like
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:40.360]   That's why I see jeff javas a lot because I liked a lot of your stuff jeff and so facebook
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.960]   The algorithm's not super bright, but said oh you're like jeff javas. Let's give you more of that
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:47.880]   Let's show you all of everything
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.880]   Most
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.720]   I expect you to say thank you facebook. Thank you facebook my nephew. He was
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.960]   20 something told me at one point that he
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:02.520]   He was on facebook, but he refused to ever like
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.400]   or comment on anything
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.960]   And I said why why would you do that and he said I don't want
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.640]   Facebook to start screwing things up with the algorithm
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.360]   So i'm trying to give it as little information as possible
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.880]   To go
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:19.880]   I just thought that was fascinating
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:22.200]   Well, and I did another thing on this show. I added
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.320]   All the the candidates for president republican and democrat. I liked them all
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.720]   My my daughter by the way immediately called me said you like donald trump
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.400]   And I had to it took great pain seriously. No. No, Abby. I'm trying to get a
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:43.960]   Fuller picture. I'm trying to get out of the filter bubble. You like Donald trump? No. No, I'm just
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:49.720]   But what's funny is I don't see a lot of political stuff in here. It didn't it didn't just yeah, it didn't change much
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.200]   Either they're not posting much or i'm not seeing it
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:56.280]   And I figured they've you ever seen have you ever seen a friend
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:59.480]   And it says they liked something and you're like
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.840]   I can't believe that that person actually liked that thing
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:08.200]   I've asked a few friends where I saw so-and-so liked a page right, you know
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:16.200]   Well, like my daughter did yeah, and then I will ask them. I never liked that. I'm not sure how that how oh you've gotten a spurious likes
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:18.760]   Yeah, hmm
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:24.040]   But it's a black box that's part of the problem. Yeah, you don't know
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.280]   How they're waiting your difference, but how could they show you that in any reasonable? They couldn't they couldn't they couldn't
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:35.880]   Oh, hey, look at this. I got Donald trump's christmas card. So now i'm happy nice
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:38.040]   I
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:43.960]   Love you all says Donald trump accept the women the blacks and his spanish
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.080]   And the losers and you stupid foolish people but everybody else I love you
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:56.760]   My god mary guess everyone I accept himself and for that now i'm going to get a hundred tweets and facebook
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.760]   So that's the other thing is
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:05.240]   Yeah, the scolding that poor jeff gets for not sticking to tech as if you're let me tell you simple rule here
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:10.440]   Never tell me what not to say because he's gonna say it. No, I've learned that
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:13.880]   I'm saying to your your audience
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.200]   You got that from jersey. I don't go for that
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.040]   Because what you don't want me to say is what you don't want to hear and that's not a very mature attitude
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.080]   No, so if you don't want it just just just wait wait 30 seconds and it's over your life
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.720]   We back to normal. We can talk about technology in all honesty
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.680]   This is why I follow crews in trump and and rubio and hillary clinton and bernie sanders
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:38.520]   I I want to hear the stuff. I don't want to hear I want to hear everything I want to get as much as I can
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.520]   Just because that's a bad side
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:44.840]   But you don't want to hear something that's something you should there's something there you should you should find out actually
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.920]   That's I think that's one of the most powerful
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.240]   arguments against
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.600]   An algorithm driven fee exactly because facebook is not trying to show you
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.320]   Things that encourage you to think about you know the alternate side of the argument
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:03.640]   It is showing you things that it thinks you will like and that you know that creates a really strong filter
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.600]   It's also for showing you things that will cause discussion and and that people are talking about
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.400]   I don't think it's that simplistic
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.160]   I'm not but no, it's not that simplistic, but that's they want to get you to
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:20.280]   Engage and I think they're they're leaning towards things
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:25.400]   You either already have clicked on or liked or things you've shown that you're interested in
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:31.960]   So you have to take self-reinsourcing. Yeah, like leo does you have to take an effort to to
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:38.920]   Tell facebook look I want to be exposed to more stuff than just the sort of things I quote unquote like
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.040]   But at least I could do that and what's interesting is facebook did not make some global
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:47.320]   Judgment at that point and start feeding me
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.120]   Other stuff, you know
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:55.400]   Conservative or republican or libertarian or democrat they didn't it just was actually worked out pretty well
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.560]   I mean now I got Donald's christmas card. I'm happy from facebook out of nowhere
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:04.600]   I found this out that chipotle is changing its menu to assure food safety. I find this very interesting other than changing
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:11.480]   Which means no more less onions onions will be blanched and marinated lemon and lime juice to kill off germs
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.760]   Instead of raw raw chicken may marinated in reasceable plastic bags
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:19.160]   Cilantro will be added to cooked rice to assure possibly dangerous micro microbes will be killed off
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:24.840]   Cheese will arrive pre shredded while pork and barbecau a beef will be shipped in pre-sealed bags
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:30.680]   Tomatoes and cilantro likely the culprit of the two outbreaks according to the cdc will be thoroughly rinsed
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:34.520]   Authority washed chopped and tested in an outside location good
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:40.040]   In short, they're not preparing anything there. My question to this is when will all this happen because I ain't going back into all that's
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.080]   I still haven't been to a jack in the box
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.960]   Why?
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.960]   Like 25 years ago
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:53.320]   And I haven't been there ever since
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:56.040]   I went I walked into one. I thought all right. This is ridiculous
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:57.000]   You're being stupid jeff
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.040]   I went to kapuisko and there's guys behind the lines that worry gloves now
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:05.560]   I tweeted about this and I know that yes, you can you can schmutz gloves the way you came your hand but they shouldn't that's not
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:10.520]   Just have the just think people and make rules they're gonna make people more comfortable
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:14.760]   So chipotle I gave you all this free people to be on the show. I regret
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:18.200]   I gotta say I ate there and I didn't like it
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.840]   I mean nothing bad happened to me
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.840]   But I just didn't think it was that good
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:27.160]   Friend of mine said when I was I said I tweeted before all this broke out that I was bored with the menu because they
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:29.000]   Break they haven't changed in 22 years and I
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.800]   And my friend sold his stock at that moment
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.720]   Wow
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.240]   He owes me
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.240]   I wouldn't break about something like that. No
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:41.720]   Hey, we're gonna take a break because this show is already over two hours. I just noticed I'm sorry, but we'll
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:44.600]   We'll have your final thoughts in just a second
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:50.200]   But first a word from fresh books the way if you're in a freelancer to uh to get paid
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.480]   Because that's kind of important. I know you love what you do
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:56.920]   What I bet you don't love is sending out those invoices at the end of the month
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:01.720]   But unfortunately that's kind of key to getting paid let fresh books do the hard stuff fresh books
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.480]   Makes it really easy to format and send invoices via email
[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:07.720]   Although they will print mail them too
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.120]   If you have one of them old fashioned clients
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:17.320]   That works in every currency worldwide. I loved that because I was building canadians and um in americans and so I had to have different currencies
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:22.600]   If you have expenses expense reports, you can actually take pictures of the receipts
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:27.800]   With your with your fresh books app on your smartphone and then it goes right into the invoice
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:33.000]   I just love fresh books and they keep adding new features things like
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.840]   uh the new request to deposit feature where you can ask
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.600]   for uh
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:44.440]   For a deposit in fresh books. So you don't have to cover a cost out of pocket or wait until the end of a project to get paid
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:47.080]   And they have a now I have a card reader
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:52.440]   So if you're if you work if you present an invoice at the end of a workday, you know, maybe you're in a home inspector something you
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:08:02.760]   Pesticide a plier. What do they call those? You know you uh, you put the you have your fresh books invoice you show the uh client the invoice
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.280]   Here you go
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:11.160]   Window washer. Here's the invoice then you put the little swipe card in there and it's they could swipe the stripe or dip the chip
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:14.280]   It's yes is the mv chip card enabled and you get paid
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:21.080]   So many great reasons why you you you should be using fresh books right now 30 days free
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.240]   And you you'll know everything about it. Just go to fresh books.com/twig

[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.120]   You don't

[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:57.240]   twig jeff javis from the city university of new york from fortune senior editor
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:59.240]   Matthew ingram
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:03.400]   It's kind of my favorite threesome here now that uh now that we've lost jina trapani to the
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.520]   startup world should come back every month as always
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.920]   but uh
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.240]   I just this is a good group you guys. I like smart
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:14.920]   conversation and we always get that when you're here, Matthew. Thank you for joining us
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:19.720]   No, thanks for having me. Did you want to mention a pick or something you like these days?
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:23.240]   Actually not so much a pick um
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.240]   Something I I thought was interesting that I didn't get a chance
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:29.880]   to write about um
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:32.200]   I noticed that four squares doing a
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.000]   said to be doing
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]   fundraising round
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.960]   Uh, and it's going to be their valuation has dropped by more than 50 percent
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:44.440]   um, I think that's
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:47.560]   I mean, that's the tip of the iceberg. We're going to be seeing more of that. I think
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.280]   um pretty soon because
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:55.160]   Some of these companies that have been venture funded are you know, they're getting a little long in the tooth and
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:00.840]   Four square was such an amazing is such an amazing service. Um, I just think
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.480]   You know valuations probably got ahead of
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:06.040]   kind of the reality of that
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.200]   What that could offer and so I think we're probably going to see a bunch of that happening
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:17.880]   Yeah, I you know the stumble I think was when they took out they separated swarm out and they took out the games and the mayors and stuff
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.200]   Now that mayorships are back. I'm using it again. I love it
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.680]   Yeah, I've started using it again too. Yeah, and I know why they split them
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:29.000]   Yeah, and I remember talking to Dennis Crowley about it and they had a good rationale
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.280]   But I I'm just I don't think it worked. No, you know a lot of people went away from it at that point. No
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.720]   Speaking of which did you read katie benner's really good piece in today's times?
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.520]   Yeah about good technology
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.960]   In fact, that was the other one I was going to use as an example
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:51.800]   Look at the valuation of that company at one point. We're talking about what it actually wound up selling for so sad
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.040]   And of course, this is the the sad thing is that the employees get hurt
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:00.680]   In fact the end of the story one of the employees said we effectively we paid to work here
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:07.880]   Yeah, because they get taxed at the higher valuation when they get stock awards before the pre IPO
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:14.360]   So the IRS says okay fine. You just got 180 thousand dollars in stock based on the current valuation pay us
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.000]   70 or 80 thousand dollars in tax
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.480]   But then when the unicorn stumbles in the valuation plummets and they ended up
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:26.520]   They were at one point valued of 50. Yeah, they were one point valued at 1.1 billion
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.400]   Blackberry eventually bought them for four to 25
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:33.480]   Yeah, that stock now is worth less than you paid in taxes
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:40.760]   And a bunch of people borrowed to to pay those taxes so I mean it's a great it's a great sort of
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.680]   You know red flag for if someone's joining good less company like that. Yeah, I mean
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:49.320]   Valuations can go in both directions
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:54.520]   And don't always just go up and of course the investors have preferred shares so they get paid first
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.200]   uh
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:59.640]   They ended up getting 125 million dollars the ceo
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.480]   Uh who arguably drove the company to the ground
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.200]   Uh got a four million dollar
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:07.800]   uh
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.480]   Paycheck and a 1.9 million dollar severance payment and has now moved on
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:15.320]   And the but the employees some of them
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:21.160]   Uh, oh 150 thousand dollars or more. Yeah, it's terrible. It's just sad
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.920]   This was a security company
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:27.560]   good technology
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.840]   that
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.600]   Ended up being part of a Blackberry which by and it's not enough itself is probably not has its own problem. Yeah
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:40.680]   Uh, but katie been a nice job on this and of course katie's uh regular on many of our shows
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:42.120]   She was on twit just a couple of weeks ago
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:47.880]   So I think there was a real there's a bunch of these companies out there that their valuations are it's not that they're bad companies
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.680]   And it's not that what they're doing isn't valuable. It's just the valuations got you know
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:55.960]   Just way just inflated beyond sort of
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.720]   Yes, what is asking about it today? I don't think that there's an and recent goes on about this a lot on twitter
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:04.120]   I don't think it was an overall bubble per se
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.720]   And we have to keep in mind that that venture capital is
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:12.920]   In majority of losing business, right? It's it's so it's the uniform is it make your money
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:17.000]   So the fact that they're wrong in percent of the time in terms of companies that just plain die
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.280]   And the fact that they're wrong in percent of the time in the valuations. That's the game
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:24.120]   It's the game. It's not surprising. It's not the first part of the part of the averages that work out
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:30.440]   And and so you when we point anecdotally at a couple of companies that have had down rounds or gone down or lost their value
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.920]   Um with a lot of people's lives and careers involved and and people's real money involved
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.480]   Yeah, but that doesn't a trend to make but
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:44.680]   Now that the way the venture capitalist structure the deals they're often made whole yes first
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:50.680]   Know what else is so they have less risk because they're made whole and that this happened with tech tv
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:53.080]   I was off. I was given a quarter of a million shares of
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.800]   Tech tv when they first started it looks so good as wallpaper in your bathroom
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:01.560]   Keep me there. They even had the gall to say, you know, if all good
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.920]   Here's a pigeon and the ceo drove a grew a graph. It all looked all like this will be worth one and a half million dollars
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.080]   And uh, what was it worth when uh, paul allen sold it finally? Well, he got made whole
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:19.080]   Yeah, not me. It was worth nothing now fortunately. I didn't pay tax on that had I paid tax on those grants
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:19.960]   Oh
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:24.680]   But they were just options. They weren't grants and uh had I paid tax on them. I would have been furious
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:31.720]   Uh, but that happens so that's pre start up boom boom anything. This has been going on for years
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:35.480]   Oh, yeah, and it's not it's not even it's not that people are doing
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:42.040]   You know that they're evil or that the system is it. This is actually the way it works. Yeah
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:45.240]   It is a little bit evil
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.800]   Because
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:54.200]   It's sophisticated finance people. Yeah kind of taking a little bit of advantage of just normal folk
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:59.000]   Sometimes I've had it employees have said what can we have stock options?
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.880]   And I just want to say to them you don't trust me. You don't want that. You don't want that
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:08.680]   I will pay you well. You don't want stock options. You should have money. You should have money
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:11.000]   um
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.080]   And that's the I think that that's there if there is malfeasance. It's this
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.720]   Kind of uh and by the way the SEC has a lot of rules to protect people
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:27.880]   Which are being eroded now by the jobs act and others because everybody wants to get in at the ground floor this exciting new economy
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.920]   Well, how many companies have I got?
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.480]   Advisory stock and the yeah nothing
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:39.480]   And I've you know, I've done a few nano angel investments very few. I don't have enough money to do much but a few
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:41.240]   No
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.240]   Yeah, yeah, I'm not the not the game
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:48.280]   I was gonna open a venture fund out of my school and my program thinking that was a good way to have an impact
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:49.160]   uh
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:52.520]   Albert vanger at union square ventures god bless him sat me down and said jarvis
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:59.800]   No, he said it's all about deal flow. Yes. You're in the top top top tier. That's right. The good deals don't come to you
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.960]   That's where you have improved anything yet. So bad deals are gonna come to you and then your steel is gonna come to you
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.480]   And that's just the way the business works and it's right
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:09.080]   um
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:11.080]   Unless you're ready and threaten his value
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:21.480]   And this is why I do kind of support the uh regulation that is now being kind of softened to protect normal people because um, you know, uh
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:28.520]   I think there you know if anybody can invest there will be people will take advantage of that. Oh, yes
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.680]   And the jobs act eliminated. I think you know some of the some of the
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.960]   Tests that you have to pass, you know income tests and so forth
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:43.240]   In the interest of making it more democratic, but you know then now the message to everybody is before you give anybody any money
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.240]   You better do some research you better learn
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.360]   Watch silicon valley if nothing else
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:52.120]   They'll tell you hooly, baby
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:58.520]   I got me some hooly stock Sheldon Adelson is the guy who bought the las vegas review journal. Yay
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:01.880]   Oh, what a story that is
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:05.160]   What we have to save that for another day that train wreck
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:07.480]   Oh my god, Shelley
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:10.040]   There's a guy. There's a shark
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:13.560]   He got out of comics just in the nick of time
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:19.480]   But he just wants it to be fair and balanced right fair and balanced. That's all we ask, but if you would investigate these judges
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:22.680]   I would I would take it as a favor
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:28.200]   Jeff you have a list. I want you to tell us about this list because this is my favorite song of all time
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.840]   All
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.840]   I love this song
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:36.760]   This is a religious song. I say it is not a religious song
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:39.720]   It's actually the opposite in fact
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:44.600]   I think Leonard Cohen would agree. Yeah, I am
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.960]   I am a huge fan of Leonard Cohen
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:54.440]   I am too. So I saw on the on the interwebs today that there was a list of 60 versions
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.440]   ranked
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.000]   Of all of the way up wow then along came the wonderful JP ryghvaswami
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:05.400]   Uh who is seven years ago in 2008

[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:18.280]   Right more than a hundred versions more than a hundred versions of the song if you go to the bottom of the newsweek one
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.520]   Yeah, I you can play a few moments of one or two and there's a little story about them

[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:12.840]   You may remember this from the shrek soundtrack
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:15.400]   Really?
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.880]   Yeah, that's where i sang katie lang to me as the absolute is pretty amazing
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:26.680]   She's got the best and she's got three or four versions. There's one looking up on youtube katie lase number five
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.280]   Where
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.680]   She sang it at a tribute to let her call on with him sitting there and it was just
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:36.680]   Who she has an amazing amazing voice. She was the uh
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:39.240]   The first cover of entertainment weekly
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:43.400]   Yeah, and it was very controversial. I heard that guy jeff jarvis say that
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.960]   Uh, yeah
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.080]   I'll play that for damn sure
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:51.960]   uh
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:56.200]   One of my favorites i'm so funny because this morning i was thinking you don't know
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:00.200]   I want to do is make a spotify playlist of as many versions of this as i could think yeah
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.480]   Yeah, it's great. So it's really just specter is good
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:08.920]   Yeah, my sister is a press trade minister and a friend of hers had the choir and another church
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:12.360]   Segment there was some controversy about it because it's not i don't think it is
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.920]   I mean it's got the word hallowalooie in it
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:17.000]   Uh, but yeah, but it's
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.560]   Sex too. Yeah, little sex is religious
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:22.600]   It's a life you ought to never mind
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:25.640]   Anyway
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.880]   It's a great son. Why do why do we call for god at that moment?
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:31.880]   Is it religious or religious?
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:36.840]   Your faith was strong, but you needed proof you saw her bathing on the roof
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:44.440]   Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you. I think it is actually a very spiritual song in the sense that it's about life. Yeah, definitely
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.760]   It's about love
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:48.760]   It's about power
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:53.080]   One of the notes there says that he let her co-insposally faxed another 15
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:56.120]   Verses i want them. I want them all
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:59.800]   Oh, that would be awesome really it brilliant man. I did my best. It wasn't much
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.840]   I couldn't feel so I tried to touch i've told the truth
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:06.920]   I didn't come to fool you and even though it all went wrong i'll stand before
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:10.040]   The lord of song with nothing on my tongue
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:12.760]   But hallowalooie
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.880]   Actually, the best part of the song is all the ways he tries to rhyme hallowalooie
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:17.880]   Yeah
[02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:23.080]   What's it to you one of the great rhymes you don't care do you do you do you?
