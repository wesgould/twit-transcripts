[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.360]   between his travels. Hither and Fither.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   And Jan. And Jan. I want to say what's the other one? I got to get up to you. Hither and Fither.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   Here and Jan. What is Jan? What it is? I don't know.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   Anyway, yeah, you're good. It's an eight hour flight away and I'm going in there.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   You're going to go where? Helsinki.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   To Jan. I'm staying at Jan's place in Helsinki. For one day. For Newse Geist.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   Google making nice with European publishers and we'll soon talk about
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.360]   Facebook. Being nice with a whole lot of stations. I hear Matthew Ingram. Great to have
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   you. Formerly of GigaOM and glad that Matthew, like many of the other, your
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   colleagues at GigaOM, landed at Fortune. And you're in that group and that's
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   so great. Yeah, it is so great. I'm so happy to hear that. Unfortunately, Matthew had
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   all of his stuff stolen in Italy. But what the heck? That was the old GigaOM gear.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   Yeah. All new fortune gear. I need to upgrade anyway. Yeah. That's nice.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Hey, what's what's all I'm going to be doing? Do you know? He's invested in
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   what he was doing was right. Yeah, he had kind of left. He had left the day to day
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   operations of GigaOM anyway. Yeah. What a year before. Well, I give if you ever
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   talked to him, we got to get him on. Would you? Let's get him on Jason. Yeah,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   that's a great idea. Yeah. Love him. He's been kind. I know he's been kind of in
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   mourning a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Poor guy. Let us talk about Google, the
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   metaverse, the universe, the Google verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   verse, the face verse, the face verse. And anything we want to talk about, this
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   show is the show for for and by smart people. Not so smart and great Britain.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   David Cameron, the prime minister of Great Britain, just off of his surprising
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   election victory. People thought it was going to be closer than it was the
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   conservatives won a majority. And now Cameron is taking advantage of his
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   majority by I'm curious what you guys think of this list.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   Think of this limiting the Queen's speech. Cameron, a great article by Glenn
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   Greenwald in the intercept. He calls Cameron's decree Orwellian quoting Cameron
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.360]   for too long. We've been a passively tolerant society saying to our citizens
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   as quote, as long as you obey the law, we'll leave you alone. It's not enough for
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   British citizens merely to obey the law. They must refrain from relieving in or
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   expressing ideas, which are majesty's government dislikes.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   Oh, yeah, that's I can't understand how a modern politician in a country like
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   Britain could say those words. I just don't understand what is going through his
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   mind when he says something like that. Well, the issue is, I mean, I don't think
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   anybody to disagree that if it's terrorist speech, maybe, you know, if it's
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   something, but it's it's how do you know? What do you how do you define that?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   Right. That who defines it in the UK? They don't have as we do in the US a
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   First Amendment, nor a section 230. And it's pretty obvious. It really is. The
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   First Amendment says the government shall make no law abridging the right for
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   speech. Now, of course, there is in the US, even with the First Amendment, there is
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   speech that's prohibited. But it's pretty clear, you know, you can't shout fire in
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.360]   a crowded theater. This sounds this you literally will not be able to tweet.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   I don't know what you could say in 140 characters. It would be so damaging to
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   the British democracy. Facebook postings, tweets, and of course, articles. This
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   bill will be is proposed. I just you have to get it approved.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   I presume so. Sorry to tell. The Queen's speech is his agenda to Parliament.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   So it's a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah. So it'll be an anti extremist bill.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.360]   Be unveiled in the I love this. I'm going to clean green walled to stop those who
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   seek to undermine our British values and instead ensure quote, we are together as
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   one society, one nation. Parenthesis says green walled. I personally believe this
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   bill was all more lyrical in its original German. Well done. If you wanted to
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   tweet, you would have to submit to the police in advanced. Any has to do that.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   Extremely understand. Oh, I see. What is your extremist? Are you a self? Are you
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   self identified extremist? Well, some say I'm an extremist. Well, right.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   If you seek to undermine democracy, I mean, you have to kind of read the tea
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   leave between the lines even understand what they're talking about. If you seek
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.360]   to undermine democracy or use hate speech in public places, but you are allowed
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   to provoke hatred. Super. It will also include new powers to close premises,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   including mosques where extremists seek to influence others. I think that all
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   and all hate speech is a dangerous doctrine as well. Yeah, I do too. We kind of have
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   that though. Don't we have limits on what you do? We do more and more. But you know,
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   the classic American example is that we allowed the Nazis to march in
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Skokie. And so to protect speech, we protect even noxious speech. And that's
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   an American belief. And you know, now on some campuses, it's getting pretty
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   ridiculous. Well, that that that that speech done only offends me or it puts me in
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   it makes me feel unsafe or I just and this is this is classic works. Ideas don't
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   hurt people. Being able to deal with ideals ideas is exactly what we should be
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   doing. And the democracy and education. Good. We have ideas in Canada. We have a sort
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   of half American half British approach. I mean, so we have hate speech laws and
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   we have we don't have a sort of any kind of amendment that protects free speech.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   But there's a real tension at least here between, you know, wanting to promote
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   free speech, but still having that kind of British history of some things you just
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   shouldn't say. So the Harper government, it sounds like is threatening to charge
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   people to hate speech for promoting boycotts of Israel. So, you know, you could
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   probably, you know, that would fit just about anything. Like there would be lots
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   of things that could fall under the that broad definition, depending on who
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   you're talking about. It's kind of shocking. Who defines it? Kind of shocking.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   All right, I thought I'd bring that up that just that's a just crossed our
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   wire. Late breaking news. But there's a whole lot to talk about. Well beyond that.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   And since apparently our last show was more than two, two and a half hours long,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   I think we're going to try it. Jason, I would get right to it. Right to it.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   Let's start with Verizon AOL. That's a big story that broke a couple of days ago.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   4.4 billion. Now, some people say, see, AOL was still worth something. That's
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   not a whole lot. Oh, it's not. It was more than New York Times is worth, but yeah.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   Verizon buys AOL. It was. Go ahead, Matthew. AOL was worth what? I don't know, 300
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   billion or something. Yeah, what was the time Warner merger? What was it? Were they
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   valued? Plus, I think. Yeah. Time Warner AOL. Where'd all that go? 164. Well,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   actually that was the opposite direction because AOL bought time Warner,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   although for 164 billion dollars. Yes. But time Warner is not still part of AOL,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   right? No. Although that is legendary. That 2001 merger is the biggest mistake in
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   corporate history. I should have saved all the tweets to a collection. The wags of
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Twitter were in the finest form for this one. Oh, yeah. For the AOL Verizon. Yeah.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   Yeah. It was beautiful. Well, it raises a couple of issues. You know,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   in gadget is part of AOL. Will they be now that they're a house organ? If the
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   Verizon company, will they be as, will they get as much freedom as they've had if they
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   don't like the phone? Can they say it? There's, you know, look at the history. Look at
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   the history of Verizon. It's not good. They tried to start a tech site that would say
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   I think controversial and they killed it. Sugar strisens. Oh, yeah. Thank you.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   What was it called? Sugar string and then the late limited sugar string. They also
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   can't name things well. It's the worst name ever. Someone who I always thought when
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   the company started when they changed the name of the telephone company, I thought
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.360]   it was a French name. There is all very small because it used to be 9x, which is a good
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   name in New York, New England, a telephone exchange or something like that. So
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   sugar string, they said that you shouldn't write about net neutrality. And so someone
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   reported that and they eventually shut it down. Verizon says, as you know, we've
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   always said this was a pilot project. We never said we were serious about sugar
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   string. So okay. So they said, well, I guess we can't do it ourselves. But maybe we
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   should buy somebody that can. So the sort of short end on this deal, correct me if I'm
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   wrong, Jeff, is that what Verizon really wanted was the ad tech that AOL has
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   developed. Yeah, the first story said they wanted the content and one of the video
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.360]   and I didn't believe that at all. It's both ad tech and ad sales. Tim Armstrong, don't
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   forget, built the American sales operation for Google. Tim knows how to do this extremely
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.360]   well. And he bought ad tech companies. Tim Armstrong, CEO at AOL.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   He's bought a bunch of company in it. Specialized in ad tech, particularly mobile
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   tech and particularly video. And it feels like that's what Verizon wants. And the
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   content just comes along for the ride. So there's speculation and let's make clear
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   speculation that others will buy actual spring or has been mentioned a lot. The German
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   publisher would buy the content businesses available. Well, the one wonders why anyone
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   would want them except for Huffington Post. What if you're a German company?
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   Okay. So mobile ad network, I understand, is not content, but is it video content?
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   But okay, but whole Leo, what video does AOL really have? So go to AOL, go to the
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   video page and tell me what you've lost after there. Well, it's not AOL. It's the
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   brands and gadget tech crunch has a video operation. Yeah, that's fine. But but but
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   is that worth $4 billion? No, it's it's and you can you can license that stuff and
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   no, that's that's I don't I don't think they want to be content at all. Huffpo.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.280]   Huffpo too. That's another AOL property. Yes, but but
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   the reports have been that they wanted to break off for the last year or so and that
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.280]   this they may break off now. There's been rumors and denials and so on and so forth.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   But I think that if they could find anyone to invest in a management buyout or to buy
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   them, they would. Here's a here's AOL's video page. Let's see what we can see.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   Yeah, just take a look. Watch live. Britney Snow, Skylar, Aston and Kate
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   Cannon on pitch perfect to that's obviously an ad. Arnold Schwarzenegger on how California
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   would survive a zombie attack. Build is some event, some that they do, right?
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   Yeah, who does build? Well, I don't know because there's Microsoft build.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   That's obviously not what this is. I don't think here's what everyone's watching.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   A week old story about Sarnev convicted week old. Maybe that's three weeks old in
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   the Boston Marathon bombing. Breckenridge off the grid. A couple appears in court
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   on criminal charges. If you go to on.aol.com, that's another one.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   On.aol.com. But it looks like it's, you know, it's an Amtrak video, Sarnev video.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   It's probably much of an EP. Yeah, this looks like news.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   Yeah, I don't think Verizon cares about that. No, do they? What you're saying, they don't
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   care. They don't want this is what they're saying. They'll sell this off.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   Okay. Now Verizon on the Fios end does have some content for, and I'm a Fios customer,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   for its effort to do a news channel on channel one to compete with cable visions
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   news 12 in my market. So that matters somewhat to them and the East Coast, but
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   that's that's minor. But yes, video matters online, but this is not the video you
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   want. But you know, Verizon has a deal with the NFL. For instance, if you have a
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   Verizon phone, you get exclusive mobile access to NFL game. Well, and the other
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   thing that's happened is that right. So advice is making big deals all around
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   the world licensing content, a license in a window to telcos. So I could see
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   vice doing a deal. But I this AOL video. And I don't see, I don't see how
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Engaged or or Hopo have things that are sort of proprietary enough, like, like
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.280]   the NFL that they could license it or have an exclusive deal with Verizon that
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   would be worth that much money. Here's some AOL exclusives. Adam Sandler,
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   million dollar noises. Season one episode once. This is like a show.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   Last lesson. It's Kevin.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   Um, and has ads on it, by the way. Oops. I'm not going to have this on.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   I have never heard of it. Well, of course, these are the two sites. No one I know
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.280]   has ever quoted AOL or Yahoo.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   And yet they supposedly have huge traffic and fire hoses and the Ariana.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   Yeah, you know what I'm starting to believe now. I just kind of thought, well,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   content, well, they've got tech crunch. They've got Engagit. They've got
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   Hopo. But Verizon doesn't want any of that. No, I think it'll go on
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   trouble. It'll be fun off her soul. Well, and if you're in a gadget, you're
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   limited on what you can review. You can't say a bad thing about Verizon
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   for resin phones. I kind of have eliminated the fun of it. Well, there was a piece
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   that was on the rundown where Engagit said they didn't buy us for our editorial.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   They're not buying that or they're not buying our soul and our boys. We will
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.280]   still be in the way. Oh, they always say that. That's what CNET said until CBS said
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   you can't give Hopper the best of CES award because they let you skip
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   commercials. They always say that. That's what the warmest drug said is
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   the same product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The editorial is going to remain.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   No one will have anything to say about it. And this is a content deal.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   I just think a lot of that is just gas. I think what we all want to know is,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   frankly, what did Xingyi have to say? And Xingyi says it's pretty cool. It's pretty
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   cool, man. Yeah. Made his hair stand on end. Pretty cool, man. Pretty cool, man.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   That's what a digital profit would probably say if you... Oh, I would just love... I would pay
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   money to be in the meeting, the Verizon executive for Xingyi.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   Xingyi, let's go stuff. You figure Xingyi's probably going to be available soon.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   Maybe. Xingyi, for those who don't know, is this guy David Xing. They call him Xingyi.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   He's got quite a style going on. He's AOL's digital profit. It's not really
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   clear what he does. No, it's not.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   He redesigned Tim Armstrong's office. He did redesign Tim Armstrong's office.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   Yep. Yep. As an AOL shareholder, I've always wanted to know how much money
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   he goes into Xingyi. Oh, and someone wondered whether Mike
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   Arrington would be interested in taking TechCrunch back. And he used an F word, I
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   believe, in the response. No, he's got his money and he's living in the Pacific
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   Northwest and he's very, very happy. He's got to be said. He wanted to back.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   I would send him for psychological assessment.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   TechCrunch has conferences. Verizon's not going to want that.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:02.280]   No. You know, Sarah Lane, who worked here, left to go tech video for TechCrunch.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   And they do have, she's doing a daily news show for them. There she is.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   So, I mean, I could see maybe there be some.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   Verizon is an icon. Yeah, I could see there for business stuff. And Tim Armstrong
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   said, I'm not selling TechCrunch, but it's not going to be up to him with a long run.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   I think there's going to be a market for TechCrunch. I think, you know, Wall Street
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:33.280]   Journal, Fortune, maybe not Forbes.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.280]   You could see who buy winners. Yeah.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   What did you say about who?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   Hey, buying TechCrunch over in gadget or both.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.280]   Yeah. And gadget's valuable. Maybe even Huffpo.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   Now, so Huffpo, you said, has been trying to get out of the AOL deal anyway, right?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.280]   They also do reports. They also do a video.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.280]   They do a live, they do something like Twit, didn't they?
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Or they were going to do a Huffpo.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   Huffpo's live. Right now on Huffpo's live. Let's just see what's on.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   Cocktail chatter with Josh Zepes.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   I think that Scotland, there's no reason everyone says, oh, it would be a disaster.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.280]   Scotland's way too small. How could they possibly survive as a country?
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   It's old news.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.280]   They did a lot of sort of Hangout shows, Google Hangout shows, where they were getting hosted.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   It's kind of like Twit, right? I mean, it tries to be more TV.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.280]   There's a real cameraman there and there's telepromptors and...
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.280]   There's books on the bookshelves.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   And, you know, eight-minute segments. I mean, it's, I've been on it and it's very, very pleasant, very nice.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   But yeah, it tries to be. It's more like old TV than it is like Twit.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   I'm just supposed... Huffington Post gets a ton of traffic.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   I mean, I think it's... Uniques are in the hundreds of millions.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.280]   Well, yeah, but that's not to the video. That's to the stories, right?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   Right.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.280]   And that's because it's kind of like Upworthy. I mean, it's all link-baid and...
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Well, I think it's good. They're higher and more real journalists.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   The other thing that's very impressive about Huffington Post, you know, as I always say,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   they laughed when Ariana sat down on the keyboard.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   And they were all wrong. And now the emphasis, and Jimmy Mayman, the CEO,
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   the emphasis is on making this a worldwide brand.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   And at the DLD conference, Huffpo was there because they have a deal with Berda runs a conference.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   And Ariana had her... I don't know how many it was, 21 world editors up there.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   And they have Huffpost Canada, Huffpost Spain, Huffpost France, Huffpost Germany.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   They've really done a pretty amazing job of creating native language sites around the world
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   and making Huffposts into a global brand.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.280]   But if you wanted this, wouldn't you buy vise? Wouldn't that be a better...
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   They've got to be better content-
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   You wanted this video? Yes, you'd buy vise.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   But if you wanted a hell of a lot of traffic and content,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   the other report, the other speculation, raw speculation,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   I don't think it came from anything but just say, "Would it be interesting if somebody said Facebook,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   given everything going on Facebook?" And I don't believe that for a second.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   I think Facebook and Google cannot own content. It's channel conflict.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   And it's anti-trust bait. They just simply can't.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   But I could imagine... So who would buy... Well, this is the interesting part.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   A lot of the story after this is what of Marissa now.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   Marissa was going to... Armstrong and Meyer were going to emerge the two companies.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   He said many rumors over the years who knew who'd be on top.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   Well, those would come out. I think Tim wanted that more than...
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   More than the first. I do so too. But Marissa could take these content properties off.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   Don't they feel like they're in the same business a little bit?
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   Oh, yeah. Like Yahoo and AOL seem like they're... Oh, yeah.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   Exactly the same. The same old business.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.280]   Same size of the same coin.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   But you could imagine Huff-Poe being a Yahoo.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   Absolutely. So maybe that's what'll happen is the content goes to somebody else like Yahoo.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.280]   That's the way it feels like to me.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.280]   I can also see that the Ashland Springer rumor comes from...
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   There are companies elsewhere such as in Germany who would like to enter the US
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   who believe strongly they can't do it on their own.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   And they could end up buying something as an entry into the US market.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   And Huff-Poes would not be a bad entry vehicle.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   As a AOL shareholder, are you happy?
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   Yeah, I guess so. I've never been happy because I got the way this works.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   It's always been bad.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   I was given, when I was a People magazine, I was given a grant of restricted shares.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   And this shows you don't ever listen to me about stocks.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   And so you get... The shares just are given to you one day.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   Well, that day when you pay taxes on them based on the value you get then,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   I got them at the extreme highest price that's ever been in history
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.280]   in the midst of the Time Warner AOL takeover fight.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   Nice.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   I'm sorry, Time Warner...
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   So you're just holding on until they come back?
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   I don't care about taking over.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   So I simply thought, "Oh, it'll get up to 120 again."
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   They're gonna come back.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   Hey, Dana.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   This way, though.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   Yeah, so the whole thing's been unraveled since then.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   So, yeah, I have AOL, I have Time Inc, I have Time Warner Cable,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.280]   which now is nowhere with that.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   Just because of that leftovers.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   I haven't touched it because it's too painful.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   Folks, don't get some kind of tips from Jeff Jarvis.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   That's the rule.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   Never.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280]   Never.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   Of course, Verizon denies that they...
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.280]   This is just a ad deal.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   They say, "Oh, maybe we're gonna spin off HuffPost, but we're staying in the
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   content business and I have Tim."
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   Have they said that out loud?
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   Tim Armstrong says he's staying in the content business and he's not selling
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   tech crunch.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280]   But he...
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   But about Verizon.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   That's Tim Armstrong.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   He doesn't get to say it in this, does he?
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   For a while, it was just expensive.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   Verizon said it was all about ads.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   Well, they didn't say that in so many words.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   But the principle interest says Verizon's John Stratton is around the ad platform.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   Sorry, sure.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:10.280]   What's interesting here is, on ad platform, Verizon and other telco, you know, the
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   NFL deal you mentioned.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   Phone companies think enclosed, fenced in universes, right?
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   Verizon, you know, Verizon, with mobile ads on its own stock, well, when it doesn't
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   happen, this is where the content thing does come in.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   Serve ads on what?
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   Where and how does it become an ad serving mechanism?
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   You know, you serve ads on content or on services.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   Verizon doesn't really have any services, they don't have any content.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Fine, it could have Huffpo, big deal.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   How much mobile traffic on Verizon phones is there on Huffpo?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   And Huffpo's business is in their interest to be on every other platform there is too.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   So, yeah, I too accepted this idea.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   In fact, said this, that I think it's about ads and that technology.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.280]   And I believe that in mobile.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   But it's hard for me to understand Verizon's role in an ecosystem because Verizon never
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   sees itself as a member of an ecosystem.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   Verizon always sees itself as its own tower.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   Well, and of course, Verizon's in what used to be a monopoly in a very strong business
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   that's starting to become less so with Google getting into the wireless business.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   And fiber business.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   And fiber business.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   That doesn't, you know, Verizon isn't the must win that it used to be.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   The funniest part to me is that Verizon can finally maybe serve all those dial up customers
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   left at AOL.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.280]   How many dial up customers are you still with?
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Lots, that's what that's for their cash free classroom.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   Couple million.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Is there a number chat room?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Is there a number?
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   I'm looking.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   That would be a good number for the week.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   Two point one million.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   I don't know what this is.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.280]   Creamy, creamy corn cob.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Well, that's an authoritative source that I've ever heard one.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   It says, sorry, creamy.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   So there's two point one mill.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   What's your source, creamy?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Here's one from, this is from Time Magazine yesterday.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   Two point two million dial up subscribers.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   The company's adjusted operating income from the dial up.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.160]   The unit that includes dial up is down eight percent year over year for the first quarter.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   But $126 million.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.280]   That just blows the mind.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.520]   Two point two, because it's 20 bucks a month.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.720]   So that means that there are a lot of people who either can't or don't want to pay for
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   higher speed internet.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.080]   Some of those, according to Time AOL dial up customers, actually aren't paying for the
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   service.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   They're getting their connection for free after threatening to cancel their subscription.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.160]   Scott Klein had the best line.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:57.120]   He said Verizon, another old guy who buys AOL because he wants to connect to the internet.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.280]   I heard there were free discs.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.440]   Yeah, the Wall Street Journal's immediate reaction was two crumbling empires merging.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.640]   Although I no longer trust the Wall Street Journal's immediate reaction because you have
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.160]   to wonder, well, what's Rupert's interest in all this?
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   I actually read a piece I can't remember who it was now, but their argument was basically
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   looking at Verizon.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.880]   This says a lot more about Verizon than it actually does about AOL.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.120]   It says Verizon is kind of desperate.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.800]   This feels like a desperation move.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:38.280]   But when I asked him to go Matthew, how do they use ad technology, desperation to what
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   end?
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   Verizon, that's a problem.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   It's not like they can offer it to game developers or something.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.320]   But then again, I go back.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.880]   They better not put ads on my phone.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   Who a guy named, oh no, I'm sorry, I can't say his name.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   What's his name?
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   What's his name?
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.320]   Wonderful man who was in charge of the AT&T online service.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:13.760]   And he's the guy who turbocharged the growth of the net when he took the clock off.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   And what's in?
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.520]   1995, a month flat rate.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   That's what did it?
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   Flat rate.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   Flat rate.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   That was that.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.520]   Now we're going back the other way.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:29.160]   This is from Fortune.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   Good publication I hear.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.320]   Aaron Griffith.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.440]   Last year the company earned a company being AOL.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.640]   Almost a billion dollars from display and search ads on the media properties it owned.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.400]   It earned almost as much, 856 million, selling ads for third party sites.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   That's AOL's fastest growing segment.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.120]   It grew 39% between 2013 and 2014.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:57.000]   You from in-house media operations during the same period, display ads fell 3%.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.080]   Search ads grew just 4%.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.760]   So it was one of those companies that hasn't licked mobile in that respect.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.400]   Oh, this would help.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.320]   Does this mean everybody's enemy is Google.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   Verizon's enemy is Google.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.520]   Is this Verizon saying, yeah, we know this phone business, not going to be so good.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.840]   Let's get into a new business.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.000]   No, I wonder.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.800]   That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.320]   I can't imagine Verizon saying that.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.480]   Or can you?
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.920]   If you do honest forecasting and you're in their business, it doesn't look pretty.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.240]   Well even Google is diversifying, right?
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.560]   Everybody should be thinking about the future.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.880]   Yeah, I mean part of the threat is this move towards Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.600]   You know, your Verizon's going to face threats from Comcast's XFINITY, which is essentially
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.280]   positioning itself to be a carrier by putting Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.960]   Google Fi, I don't know how big a threat that is because it's based on carriers.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.760]   I mean, a threat to pricing models.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   Right.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.360]   And even then, it's about the same, isn't it?
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.440]   Just a little less imprisonment.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.760]   Does Verizon want tech news?
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.920]   Why would they want tech news?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.800]   Why would they want video for that, Matt?
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.280]   It just ties up their network.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   It doesn't...
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   I don't think they do.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:22.640]   And if you look at the entire AOL doesn't break out, Huffpo or any of those assets, but
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:29.560]   the media unit in their statements, I think last quarter, that entire unit had operating
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.400]   income of $13 million.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.640]   So that's Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Gadget, all those other sites.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   $13 million.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   I see that number.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   Wow.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   It's tiny.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   It's pennies.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.200]   What did Gee-Om have?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.000]   You know, geez.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.200]   I got to figure this is actually...
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.080]   I don't see why this is a good deal for Verizon in any respect.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.920]   I think about it.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.120]   I think the ad targeting tech is worth something, whether it's worth $4 billion or not.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   I don't know.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   But I think it is worth $1 billion.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   What do they do, though?
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   How do they use that?
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.640]   Well, they've got it.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.560]   So my understanding is, and this is not my area, but my understanding is that AOL is
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:13.240]   good at figuring out how to deliver and when to deliver and to whom to deliver video ads.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.560]   So that's something that presumably would be worthwhile to Verizon.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800]   It knows a lot about you as a phone user.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.280]   It's got your user ID, your device ID.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.320]   You know, presumably it's got your location.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.080]   So it has information with which it can target ads or videos.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   That's my understanding.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:38.600]   I'm a good Tim Armstrong with Marissa Meyer at CUNY some years ago.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   And Tim's strategy at the time was to say that all the ad money goes to the top sites,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.960]   media sites, that's where the ad business works and still does.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.000]   And I'm going to make AOL into one of those.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.560]   And that's why I'll have a lot of content.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.160]   So we'll have a lot of volume.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.840]   And the ad business lord knows is still volume based.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   My rallying cry these days is we've got to shift volume based advertising will commodify
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.320]   toward zero.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:11.080]   And we have to shift to value based models starting with attention, but also other value
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.800]   based models.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.040]   And pure volume is just going to be pure cats.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.440]   And it's not, you don't make it up on volume.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.960]   It's not a good business.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.800]   But that's where AOL was headed.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.640]   He got more content.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.720]   Meanwhile, he's really good at selling ads and really good at that structure and brought
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.600]   as much advertising as good to it.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.880]   But so they went more into the pure ad business.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.840]   Well, if you're going to go into ads, don't do online video ads because Google says only
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.200]   about half of them are ever seen at all.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.680]   Get this.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.080]   These are the worst statistics ever.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   Viewability.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   Viewability.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.240]   So that means I can't issue immediate, right?
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.960]   An ad is only viewable if half or more of its pixels are visible on the screen for at
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.040]   least two seconds.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.320]   So what it's saying is that of all the video ads being served, half, only half are never
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   even seen for two seconds.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.800]   76% were in a background tab.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.920]   And we're never on screen at all.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.520]   24% were scrolled off screen or abandoned in fewer than two seconds.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.280]   I mean, what proportion is just auto play video ads where you've got to open.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   And it just suddenly loads the ad.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.040]   And we're ripping off advertisers.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.360]   And ad plays on a web page and no one sees it.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.960]   Does it exist?
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.600]   Others are sending an erd because they're interstitial.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   They're interstitial.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.680]   They're native.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.760]   Just careful with that word native.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.000]   I agree, but they are the good kind.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.880]   They are true to the form.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.200]   It's been absolutely corrupted and it's corrupting.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.600]   And you know, I don't like it very much, but radio advertising, which is basically what
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.920]   you have, has always worked for that reason.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.240]   It fits into the form.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.440]   Now, by the way, consider the source.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.720]   This comes from Google and you should know that they didn't look at YouTube ads because
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.480]   YouTube is a video destination site.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.040]   So 91% of those ads are viewed.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.120]   So what they're really saying is if you want to do video ads, put them on YouTube.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   Sure.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.280]   I mean, does anybody not click skip this ad?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.200]   I always skip it.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   Sometimes no.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.000]   I will occasionally get one that either is a, compelling enough or b, relevant enough.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Right.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.200]   That I will end up watching it.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.760]   The onus really is on the buyer, ad buyer.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.000]   Because if you make an ad that's competitive, well, you have four seconds.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.920]   If you can make an ad that's, by the way, I guess that's where the four seconds come
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   from.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   That makes it viewed.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.200]   If you make an ad compelling enough that you don't skip ad, that's good.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   It's both Leo.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.320]   It's also on the server because it's relevance.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   Right.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.200]   You know, you show me an ad for a new test.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   That's true.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   I'll watch it.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   Right.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   Something I want to watch.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   I've never watched a video ad except by accident.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   Wow.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.640]   And you know, the truth is, come on.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.280]   Haven't you watched a Google ad?
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.720]   Google ads are compelling.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.120]   You admitted that.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.880]   You've seen them.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.720]   Come on.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.520]   Old grumpy, almost.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.240]   Come on.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   But isn't that why Facebook auto plays the video now and, you know, you want to see
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   them?
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.960]   Well, also, but also, but for Facebook, it's fascinating to me how much more video I watch
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.720]   because, oh, what the heck it's already playing.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.240]   And the auto play, which is so irritating when you go to a site for a different reason,
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.120]   right, silent auto play on Facebook, I find it be a very good experience.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.160]   Are those ever ads that they're all aren't they always content from a?
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.920]   Do they do video ads yet on Facebook?
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.920]   Not yet.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   I don't know that they'll ever do them, but that's what's coming.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.120]   I don't think they, I don't think they auto play.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   Okay.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.720]   I mean, I don't mind an auto play video with it's a cute puppy.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   Right.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   It's an ad.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   Ah, ah, ah, there we go.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   There we go.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   Cup puppy ads.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   You can sell puppies.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.440]   Matthew, that's kind of cool.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.200]   I just went to my Facebook.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.880]   I just seen his hosting prices, right, prices, right, is doing a socially awesome week with
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.680]   social media gurus.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.200]   And I just seen his hosting this week or today or something.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.440]   I just thought I'd pass that along.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   I think there's a huge, you know, whether it's auto play or videos that like the skip ads
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.720]   or people ads playing in tabs.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.120]   There's just a vast, vast amount of wasted money.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.920]   Like the old saying used to be, you know, 50% of my ad spend is wasted.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.800]   I just don't know which 50 is probably 90%.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.960]   It's 90% particularly with video.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.760]   Nobody knows who the hell is actually watching them.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   I would bet 80 to 90% goes on one.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.360]   Millions of dollars.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.120]   Not yours, obviously.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.000]   That's Leo leaking money right now.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.840]   Everybody in media knows that ads, the measurement systems, all of this stuff is just made up
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.640]   and you know, Neil said it's relative BS.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.520]   And so you buy the advertisers know that too.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.040]   And they buy on relative BS.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   Right.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.240]   Well, you know, paper ads were BS too, right?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.160]   Oh, everybody reads the whole newspaper.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   But everybody reads every page of every newspaper.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   Of course.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   Right.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.000]   Those display ads may never get seen.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.120]   But I guess people read every newspaper.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.760]   If it didn't work for people, they wouldn't do it though, right?
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.040]   Or is it just they'd buy, they do it completely on faith.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.680]   Coca-Cola has no idea what would happen if it bought no ads versus buying a lot of ads.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.080]   I think they have a hundred.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.200]   You basically have a hunch.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.760]   So you run an ad, more people buy Coke.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Right.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.920]   So it must have worked, right?
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.240]   One of the reasons that almost all podcast advertisers are direct response advertisers
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.720]   because they can measure it.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:59.560]   They know we bought ads, you know, Casper knows we bought ads on Twig.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.200]   And they don't pay us for sales.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.600]   They just pay us for the impressions.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.920]   But they know where the other there are counting for the value of it.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.200]   They say, well, it costs us whatever $10,000 in ads.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.360]   And we got $20,000 worth of mattress sales.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.840]   They're happy.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.760]   And they can track a code that someone uses to come from your site.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.640]   Those things are measurable.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   It's the stuff that-
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   It's brand advertising.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   It's brand advertising.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.040]   And that's one of the reasons podcasts don't get brand advertising because they don't have
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.280]   the- it's all done in faith, right?
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.200]   I mean, brand advertising is done on faith, whether it's NBC or Twitter.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.560]   But they have more faith than NBC that that tide ad on NBC is working than they do that
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.560]   the tide ad on Twitter.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.040]   But you got it from Ford.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   That was brand advertising.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   I think our biggest problem, really, is it's correct me if I'm wrong because I just made
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   this up.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.520]   But agencies that do the ad buying make money based on the amount of dollars spent.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.920]   We're too cheap.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.160]   It's too much trouble to buy and add on a podcast or a podcast network because it's
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   such a small buy.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.840]   They don't make enough money.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   Exactly.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.280]   So they're just going to go, oh, I'm going to make a million dollar buys because I'll
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   make more money.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   Right.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.360]   So it's just cheaper to make them buy and add agencies are lazy.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.600]   And it's absolutely stupid.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.320]   The most ad dollars go to the top three or four sites.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.040]   Efficiency is not the measure they use.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:24.760]   Well, there's a corollary to the, you know, no one never got fired for buying IBM.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.260]   No one ever got fired for putting an ad in the New York Times or buying an ad on some
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.920]   CNN.com, right?
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.440]   So everyone does that regardless of whether it actually works or not.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.240]   That's why in some ways we're the secret sauce for the companies that do.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.920]   Atlantic, we just had an article that's saying, why square spaces on every podcast you ever
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   heard?
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.040]   And we love square spaces.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.240]   And I think I'm pretty sure we were the first podcast they ever bought.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.600]   And it was a huge success.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.160]   And that's why square space said these work.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:59.680]   So the companies that discover that this more efficient form works are kind of have
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.920]   a secret ace in the hole.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.040]   The problem is it's not, it's never going to be gray or one of the big media buyers
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   that discovered us.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   Right.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.440]   It's going to be either an individual advertiser.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.200]   Some of our advertisers do their own buys or a small network.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.440]   In many cases devoted to new media advertising.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   How many RFPs do you deal with?
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Lots.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   Most of them.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.120]   So there are just to explain to the audience that when an agency puts out for a call for
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.160]   proposal and says, this is what we want.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.680]   Hey, come sell yourself to us.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.240]   A lot of them come from direct, not agencies, but directs.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.360]   But we are, but they're so we will, we deal with a number of their like agents.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   Some of them are agencies.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.200]   Some of their ad brokers or ad buyers.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.640]   But we deal with them a lot.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.120]   We turn down more than half out of the box.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.040]   In fact, it really annoys people when we say no.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.680]   They go, wait, I'm not good enough for you.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.840]   No, they get insulted.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   Why do you usually say no?
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.080]   Because it's not a good fit for our network or I don't want, I don't think we should
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:10.040]   be promoting a product or, you know, we, we, part of the value of our advertising is that
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.480]   we, we, we, you know, it's not just random stuff.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   Yes.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.400]   And that's why it works.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   That's why it works.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.160]   But it's unheard of an advertisers don't get it.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.320]   It's unheard of for any media company to turn down money.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   It turned down.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.600]   It's unheard of when we say no, we don't, we don't want your money.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.800]   It's like, but, but what's wrong with me?
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.360]   But it's money.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   It's great.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.440]   See, it would quickly devolve if I started taking ads for any old damn thing, it would
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.600]   quickly, you would, you audience members would no longer, it would just be, it would
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.960]   be a background noise again, like most ads.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.360]   Well, the whole value of the ad is you saying, I have used this.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   And our selectivity.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.560]   And I liked it and it worked.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.360]   And our knowledge of who our audience is and what they might be interested in, so forth.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.760]   Well, when I saw the heads of, of, of Casper and Harry's at, at the DLD Conference of New York,
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.120]   both of them advertise on Twitter.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   And, and you know, it's, it's, they're, they're like oddly in the family celebrities.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.480]   You know, there's a relationship there.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   It does matter.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   It does work.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.000]   Your voice reading these matters.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.200]   We, that's the thing that's sometimes frustrating is that we do always hear from every one of
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.480]   our advertisers that we work much, you know, orders of magnitude better than any other ads
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.040]   they buy.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.480]   But it doesn't mean they, Ford is a good example.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   It doesn't mean that we keep the buy.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.480]   They're really well for Ford.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.680]   They did, they, of course, Ford because they're a brand didn't have direct sales numbers,
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.400]   but they did research and we came out.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.240]   I've never, I mean, I saw the research.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.840]   I've never seen anything like it, but they get tired.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   They get tired.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.960]   The shiny thing, you know, just, just small buy.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.400]   It's such a, and Ford does its own in house.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.000]   They have their own in house agency.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   So they do the buy.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.280]   It's still such a small buys is too much work.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.960]   It's like, eh, what, and they who spent more than a million dollars a year on Twitter,
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.840]   but it's like, that's nothing because they spend 500 million dollars a year on network
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.840]   ads.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   This is nothing.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.200]   So it's not, it's just not worth the energy.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   It's very interesting.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   I find it fascinating.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   I don't, I'm sorry.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   That's just all about me.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   Not enough about me.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.680]   Enough about you.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   Let's talk about our new newsstand.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.280]   Jeff Jarvis says, I for one welcome our new newsstand.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.760]   Meanwhile, Matthew Ingram says his Facebook, a partner or a competitor for media companies.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.320]   Yes.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.360]   We're talking about this new Facebook program.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.600]   Even though I slathered about it, I can't even friggin.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.160]   It's not an android.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.320]   So it's called instant articles.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.120]   The big, some big publishers already in partnership, New York Times, The Guardian, Buzzfeed, National
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.040]   Geographic.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   What happens?
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   What is it?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.280]   By the way, it's only on the Facebook mobile app.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Right.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   And only on iOS.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   Okay.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   Well, I got it right here.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.000]   Let me see what it, what does it look like?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.760]   It's just a really well formatted article.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.800]   So Facebook works its magic on the article.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.680]   And it's in the newsfeed.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.280]   It's in the feed and you read, you can read the whole thing in your feed.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.000]   Videos play automatically.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.040]   It loads faster.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   Okay.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.960]   And you don't have to click to go open and, you know.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.120]   I was just looking at my desktop and this so far looks the same.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Exactly.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.560]   There's Gina Trapani's link.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.120]   There's only a few of them, so The New York Times only put one on.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   Oh.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.600]   And I can't guarantee I'd see it, right?
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   Right.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.640]   But if you go to Facebook.com/instant, I think there's a list of them.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.120]   But you can't just look in the Facebook app and expect to see it.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.880]   If you follow The New York Times, you'll see it.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   It's the first one.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.640]   The New York Times is the first one on.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.760]   The other eight publishers, it's around the world.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.640]   So it includes The Guardian, BBC, built in Germany, which is owned by actual Springer,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.440]   which is the leader of the war against Google.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.800]   I'm going to have a look at it today.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.320]   Let me like the New York Times.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.080]   I've liked them.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.560]   And this is one of them, right?
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   Marriage in India.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   Is that one of them?
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   No.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   I would guess.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   Don't.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   All right.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.080]   So maybe if I go back to my home feed now that I liked them, will I see it?
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.080]   Here's Trey Radcliffe.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.080]   Yep.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.920]   By the way, Trey had the same thing happen to him that happened to you.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.080]   Matthew, his bag was stolen from under a train seat.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   No kidding.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   With lots of expensive cameras.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   He had his entire collection of sewing cameras and like a lenses in there.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.080]   Wow.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.880]   Yeah, it was a big loss for him.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.120]   Yeah, I just had an old laptop and old iPad.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   So I don't see anything yet.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.480]   But so now, so like The New York Times, like The Guardian, like Buzzfeed, like National
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:54.320]   Geographic, and maybe you'll go to instant articles dot FB dot com.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   Okay.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   On the way.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.320]   No, that's that's there.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.200]   Well, maybe, maybe there that's that maybe it'll have a link to something to get a demo
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   of it.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   Okay.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.720]   So tell me what you expect.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   What wrong?
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.680]   It's a new way for publishers to cut.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.680]   Fast interactive articles.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.720]   The thing is you're not going to click off.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.160]   That's what's different, right?
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   Right.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.560]   Quest for a Super B interactive and immersive.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.720]   Is there other ads in there?
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.840]   Autoplay video comes alive as you scroll through the article.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.480]   So this is that auto play stuff that we've using existing production tools and standard
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   markup.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.720]   You could publish any type of article.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   That's good.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   It makes it easy for the publisher.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   Right.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   And does you pay Facebook for this or what?
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.120]   You know, they face the rev share.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.400]   Ah, so not just more than a share.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.960]   If you sell the ads yourself, you keep 100% of the revenue.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   You get 100%.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.560]   If Facebook sells the ad.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   Yeah, 70.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   70%.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   Okay.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.000]   So what it means is on an article-per-article basis, you're even.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.080]   If Facebook sell, if you choose to take the Facebook ads, probably because they had a higher
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   value ad.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   So you're probably up.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.880]   You're going to get new distribution.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.400]   Offering a mental distribution for this.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.760]   So you may be up.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:13.440]   So really what you're saying, Jeff, is this is a new medium for publishers to take advantage
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.440]   of.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.760]   I'm saying that we have no choice but to deal with this.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.200]   We have to go to where the users are, the idea that we vertically control every piece
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.280]   of a media chain is over.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.920]   And we have to do this.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:30.000]   And we see, I think, a golden opportunity right now between Google and Facebook, where
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.520]   Google, as we discussed last week, is trying to make nice and sign friendship packs with
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   eight publishers.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.880]   I think Facebook probably went to nine just to say, "Nanny, I Google."
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.040]   But the Google pack does all kind of, "We'll develop stuff and we'll give you a bribery
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:48.480]   front for innovation and we'll do some training and some fellowships and that kind of stuff."
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.120]   Facebook leapfrogs them because it comes out and says, "Well, actually, we're going
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.560]   to affect your business.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.760]   We're going to improve the experience for the users so that users will end up seeing
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.880]   more stories because they don't click off on stories because it's an awful experience
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.960]   and it takes forever.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:07.080]   When you publish here, you will get new audience.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.480]   They will see it in situ.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.000]   You get your brand, you get your comm score bragging rights.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.280]   And you get 100% of the revenue, well, it's not to love.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.760]   Well, here's the part I don't love.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.440]   It doesn't hand over data that enables relationships.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.800]   My spiel, these days, is we've got to have relationships.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.000]   We've got to give people greater relevance by knowing them as individuals.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.520]   Facebook will still know our users as individuals and we still will.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.720]   Now, I've talked to people across many technology companies who said, "Well, okay, Jarvis,
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:40.600]   but if we gave that data or if publishers had that data, they wouldn't know what to do
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   with it."
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   True.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   Stipulated, your honor.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.160]   We're idiots about that.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:51.280]   But Facebook and Google could school us in that and help us improve our service and our
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.240]   relevance and our value, which in turn would improve the content we put on these services
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.800]   and it's a win for both.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.600]   So this is an important first step in my view.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:07.080]   Now the naysayers like Matthew Ingram will tell you in a minute that, "Uh-oh, Facebook
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:14.640]   is the spider in the fly and come into my web here and when you're addicted, I'll pull
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.800]   the rug off from underneath you."
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.320]   And yeah, that could happen.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.860]   We need a lot more discussions about trust, about the nature of the deal and especially
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:30.280]   about Facebook's role now as not just a distributor, but to some degree a gatekeeper and even
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.360]   an editor of the news that people see.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   What is the negative?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.800]   What is the negative, Matthew?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.560]   I mean, it seems to me...
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.960]   I see the benefit as a publisher.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.040]   So yeah, Jeff says you don't get any information about your big deal.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.840]   You don't know that much about who buys your newspaper at the newspaper at the newsstand
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.600]   either.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.320]   And I get eyeballs, I get people sharing my content, I get some excitement around my
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   content.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.960]   It's done in a form that's easy for me to do.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   So what does the bet...
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.120]   And it doesn't cost me anything, right?
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:59.800]   I don't have to pay Facebook for this privilege.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.840]   So there's two aspects.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:07.920]   And when it comes to the negative aspects of Facebook controlling the news feed and when
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.980]   the news feed, this is not a theoretical thing.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.680]   We have examples of when this has occurred.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.240]   Zynga is one example.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.920]   Hitched its wagon to Facebook, got destroyed effectively because they changed the algorithm.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.640]   That's billions of dollars.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.720]   Not only that, we have an example from the media industry.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.360]   The Guardian, The Washington Post created social reading apps.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.960]   Facebook promoted them so that people could read articles.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   Well, okay.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   So I'll come back to that one.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   I'll come back to that one.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.880]   So Facebook promoted those heavily, right?
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   And it was great.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   They got lots of readers.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.640]   They got lots of people subscribing and downloading these apps or sharing them or whatever.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.200]   And then Facebook changed the news feed algorithm.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.000]   Those things were hidden more and those readers disappeared.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.360]   So and Facebook said, "You know, sorry, we changed the algorithm for other reasons."
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.680]   So the risk...
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.720]   This is what I said in the thing I wrote for "Fortune" about it.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   It's not that Facebook...
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.680]   This is evil and not crap.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.160]   This is my trip so I could say what I want to say.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.200]   It's that they're going to do it accidentally.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.840]   They're going to make decisions that benefit Facebook and those decisions are going to impact
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.400]   these publishers who are getting 70, 80% of their traffic from Facebook.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   And what's...
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.120]   One should not rely on Facebook, obviously, but if you're the New York Times, it's just
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.120]   one of...
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.320]   That was Matthew's point on Twitter the other day.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.080]   But I'm not sure that you can really move those dials as easily as you want.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.720]   And suddenly you've got to flood a Facebook traffic.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   What are you going to say?
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   No.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   Yes, you need to diversify elsewhere.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Facebook is diversification.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.800]   It's diversification from the old model of making people come to you.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.000]   This is why it is the...
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.280]   Actually the spider in the fly is not the best analogy, but this is why it's like the
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.800]   scorpion in the frog.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.480]   Frog has to get across the river.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.480]   Right.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   Picky, picky, picky, math.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   Carry the scorpion.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.840]   Scorpion stings the frog.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Why?
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   Because it's not the same nature.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.160]   Facebook is going to do what benefits Facebook.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   Of course.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160]   Facebook.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.160]   Now let me answer your point.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.160]   Now let me answer that point.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.400]   You just made about the earlier Guardian Washington Post thing.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   And I had similar concerns.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.440]   And I talked to people at Facebook about this.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.720]   And their point was that it was a really awful consumer experience.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   And I remember that.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.400]   There were two problems with that app at the time.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:24.600]   Number one, if you are a Washington Post user and you read articles without you knowing
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.240]   or asking what you read was shared across your friends.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.080]   Stupid wrong by Facebook, but that was one.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   Some people were irritated by that.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.160]   The second thing they were irritated by was they were getting spammed by these publications.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.720]   There was too much stuff in the feed.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Papers were not too much.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.760]   And Facebook had too little control over it.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.520]   It was a bad user experience.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.880]   And I think we could all agree about that.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   It was.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   It was totally...
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.040]   It was good for publishers.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.600]   So it wasn't just a one day Facebook just said, "Oh, we don't like this.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   Now we turn this down."
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.840]   And they said, "You know what?
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.040]   We tried this as Facebook often does and said, 'This didn't work.'
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.880]   But then over time, they came back.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.640]   They have an experience that I think, if I could only see it on my phone."
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.640]   In theory...
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   It's a great experience.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   It's a great experience.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   And that is not...
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.960]   But that's actually part of my point.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.280]   So Facebook is going to make decisions based on what it wants for its users.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   And some of those decisions may benefit...
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   What's wrong with that?
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   ...to New York Times.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.800]   Nothing is wrong with that.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.120]   And one of those decisions may benefit from New York Times and some moat.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.120]   Some moat.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   Here's the risk.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   What do I propose this?
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.280]   What if Facebook decides it doesn't want to show you news articles about Syria because
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   it's depressing?
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   Right.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   That's a different question.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   That's a different question.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.160]   But that happens all the time, Jeff.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.720]   It happens all the time.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   Plus...
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   Well, all right.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   But here's the case not to you.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   It cares at all about journalism.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   Did New York Times presumably care about journalism?
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.960]   Who said they must?
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.400]   No, but here's the risk.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:53.800]   If you, as a major media enterprise, start doing this and you build Facebook, you're just
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.440]   giving Facebook more and more...
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.440]   Exactly.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   ...packily.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   You're in effect...
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.960]   You're undermining your future because if you're moving everybody to this Facebook platform...
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.760]   No, but Leo, you're presuming.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.840]   Well, Leo, you're a bloody fool to put your stuff on YouTube then.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   Then don't do it.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   I am.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   I am.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.840]   But you have to.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   Right?
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   Well, we put it there.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   It's not...
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   It's a very small part of our revenue because the way YouTube works doesn't really impact
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.000]   us and never would even if YouTube became the dominant...
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Yes, that's true.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.440]   But I think there is a very real risk here that Facebook becomes, is already, in fact,
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.600]   the source of news for large quantities of people.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Yes, that's what worries me.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   Facebook becomes the place where people get their news.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.160]   They stop paying attention to who it comes from.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.360]   How does that benefit news brands that have hitched their wagon to Facebook?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   But Matthew, you're also presuming.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.560]   You're also presuming that people are going to still say, "I want to come to the news brand."
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.960]   That idea of having a website and making people come to you, we know from Facebook traffic
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   is zilch.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.360]   How do people discover our stuff?
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   Because they're recommended.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.840]   Where is it recommended from Facebook?
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.120]   We're already there.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.560]   Whether you see it on Facebook or see it on our site, it's coming from Facebook, not because
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.120]   it's coming from Facebook, but because it comes from people.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.440]   Now, the points you raised that I absolutely agree with you now, I agree with you now.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.560]   So give me a chance.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.640]   The point where I'm going to agree with you, and this was an issue in Peruja, and I discussed
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.320]   this on the show afterwards, Andy Mitchell from Facebook gave a talk and got asked by
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.040]   George Brock of City University in New York, I'm sorry, the other City University, the one
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.600]   in London, the second one.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.880]   George said to him, "You've got to acknowledge your responsibility for exactly what Matthew
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.760]   is talking about, that you're a gatekeeper now to news.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.200]   You've got to deal with that."
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.080]   And Facebook gave the Facebook corporate answer, which is, "Well, we don't really control
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   what you see.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.840]   The user is what the users see."
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.400]   Now, there is some truth to that.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.120]   And that's what they're trying to argue with that study that came out with the filter bubbles.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.840]   I'm still, let me get it to finish agreeing with you.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.360]   Please continue agreeing with me.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:09.160]   There's some truth to that in the sense of when Eli Perruser and the filter bubble complained,
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   the truth was Facebook said, "We don't show you any conservatives Eli because you never
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.320]   look at them."
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.200]   And so he bears responsibility.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.800]   We bear, if I never look at serious stories, Facebook is not wrong to presume I don't want
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   Syria.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.040]   Facebook is not a newspaper.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.840]   They say straight out, "Our first goals connect friends and family."
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.360]   And then news came along for the ride.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:34.840]   No one should depend upon Facebook solely for their news.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I think we have to look at it a different way, Matthew.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.960]   I think we have to look at it and say that this is bonus for us.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.560]   The question is, this is why I push for the data.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.920]   If I could make myself more relevant to you more often and get more engaging.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.160]   And if I could get you to then, yes, come to my site and have a relationship with me
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.880]   or subscribe to my newsletter or do whatever, then I have benefit.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:59.240]   But I think that where we'd also agree is you can't just ignore this in the dramatic
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.920]   focus around I'll finish one second.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.960]   The writer said that this was a, you used the word to a Faustian deal.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:11.440]   And the problem with that is that acts as if Facebook or Google is just going to corrupt
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   us.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.000]   The focus writer was talking about the Google deal.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.480]   You were talking about Facebook deal.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.280]   Well, it's not the people who are there were reaching don't corrupt us.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:24.080]   We don't have much choice but to figure out good ways to deal with this new business model.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.920]   And so me, the art of this is negotiation.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.000]   What are the good business terms?
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.440]   Not the emotional, I don't like this terms.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.320]   So now I'll shut up.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:41.440]   And I totally agree that news organizations should use whatever means they can to reach
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   readers.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.720]   And that includes Facebook and it includes Snapchat and it includes Instagram.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.840]   I would like to see a bit more of that kind of thing than tying your business model to
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:59.680]   Facebook because all the terms that matter are Facebook's to control all of them.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.120]   And people see your content, how people see your content, who's.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.840]   They must negotiate how much they charge for the ads, how much percentage they give you.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.920]   Sure, they'll give you 70% now.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   What about a year from now?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   What about two years?
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.360]   I know these are this I went to the same discussion with my students in class where they said,
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.360]   I don't like Facebook.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.360]   I don't do with Facebook.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   And I said, you can't do it.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   You can't do it.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.400]   Yeah, you can end up walking away from the negotiation table.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.040]   But the right way to have this discussion is what terms do you want?
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.320]   What is Facebook have that you want?
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.680]   What do you have that they want?
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:33.960]   What would be mutually beneficial and forget the fear factor, build that into the business.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.120]   Sometimes, scorpions and frogs have to take boats together.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120]   Right.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.920]   So, Matthew, what is Facebook have to get across the river?
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.120]   The deal you use like scorpion and frog and all.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   Well, don't they?
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   Aren't they struggling?
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   Aren't they traditional media outlets?
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   Sure, they are.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.840]   Especially to reach the younger audience that new media is.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.720]   But it feels to me, it feels to me like lots of publications and I'm not naming anyone
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:03.040]   here are fixing the entire, they're hoping that Facebook is kind of the Holy Grail.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   Like it is going to solve their problems.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.600]   Just like Joe Walz tablets and native advertising.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.200]   Plenty of Holy Grail is out there.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   All of them suck.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.640]   So, not that they shouldn't do it or work with Facebook.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:20.040]   But I think you've got to be very, very clear at what Facebook wants versus what you want.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.440]   Tell me what are the business terms you would consider good.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.040]   What's the way to have this discussion?
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   And Facebook is not interested.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   What do you want?
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.040]   Well, I don't think it matters.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.200]   I think you brought the right, that that much easier than your journalism.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   That you brought up, Jeff, of YouTube.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:40.520]   Because if you are relying on YouTube for your content business, which I'm not, but
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.960]   if you were, that would be very risky.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:47.000]   And the power of YouTube is such that you don't really have any negotiation power with
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   YouTube.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   Right.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   But here's my point.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   You do have, let me get in.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.800]   There is a small, slight window right now caused by the German publishers I've complained
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   about.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.240]   Let's give them credit that Facebook and Google want friends in publishing.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.120]   In part because they fear government coming after them.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.280]   In part because they're sick of this war.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.000]   There is, and because they're leapfrogging each other.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.360]   So Google tried to be nice.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   Facebook is nicer.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.600]   Now, what Google do?
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.120]   There is a negotiation position here.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.760]   So I would argue very, very strongly the thing to do now is to sit down and say with no
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.080]   emotion, none of this, oh, I don't like them.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   I don't trust them.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.240]   What are they going to do?
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   It's a matter of negotiation.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.760]   If you deal in the cable business, you can bet whoever you're dealing with is going to
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.080]   try to screw you every way to Sunday and then sell your corpse and you deal with people
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   in that industry.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   No, fine.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.200]   These people are nicer than cable by far, nicer than Verizon by far.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.840]   We have to be able to figure out how to deal with them.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.480]   So the answer I would ask you is the same one I asked my students.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Not any of that.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.880]   Tell me what's a good deal with Facebook.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.560]   But to me, it's more than that.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.160]   To me, it's more than that.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.200]   You cannot deal with the Facebook algorithm.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.360]   There is no deal that you can.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.360]   No, you can't.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Yes, you can.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   You can.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   No, you can't.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360]   You can't.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   Facebook controls that algorithm and they will not promise you anything.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.360]   They won't come from it.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.240]   So Facebook is saying, wait, wait, wait, Facebook is saying, we won't promote.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   Facebook is saying we won't.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.400]   Imagine, imagine you sat down with Mark and you got him drunk and Mark said, okay,
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   Matthew, what do you want?
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   What are you going to say?
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   Mark, I know you're the refugee.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.600]   But Jeff, that's, that, I understand what you're saying.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.160]   Can you tell me, tell me why you keep taking down pages and stories about the Syrian Civil
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   War?
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   Tell me why.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.600]   Tell me why you take down pictures and videos about it.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.120]   There's no incentive for Facebook to do that.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   There's no window.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.240]   Why should we trust you with our business term?
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.440]   Let me put it as a business term.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.000]   The business term would be that if you're the New York Times, you say, listen, I'm a
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   valued brand.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   I'm going to walk away from you.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.400]   That's not going to look good.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.640]   So I want you to assure me that end times a day, if I say something is important to someone
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.200]   who subscribed to me, we will agree to a number that you will say that I will serve that to
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.040]   my readers because I believe that's important.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.000]   And that is a business term.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.440]   It's not about playing with the algorithm.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.280]   It's a business term that you can negotiate.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.160]   If you can, if we don't go to the table with any business terms, we will never get anything.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160]   Well, one thing.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.080]   Hold on, let's be great.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.200]   If you could get Facebook to do it, we don't know what the terms are.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.560]   We don't know if we don't try.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   We don't know if the terms are that the New York Times and the National Geographic got.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.000]   But I think you're giving a lot more credit to the value of the New York Times and National
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.840]   Geographic to Facebook than probably Facebook does.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   I don't want to.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.000]   Listen, we're not going to put our entire time.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   We'll do what it wants with the algorithm.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   I agree.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   I think you're right, man.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.880]   It's difficult to do whatever is required.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.320]   And if New York Times stories about important news topics, don't get clicked on.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.400]   They will be hidden in the news feed period.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.600]   And I don't think you can negotiate all you want, but it.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.360]   Well, and maybe the New York Times shouldn't be, maybe that's the wrong thing to negotiate
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.360]   for, by the way.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.720]   If I were the New York Times, I wouldn't negotiate for saying show serious stories.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.280]   What I would negotiate for is saying that this is a chance to have a relationship with
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.680]   an individual and give them greater relevance, but I can't do that Facebook if you don't
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   give me data.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.600]   Now, now, can that be corrupting?
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   I'll give them, I'll give you nothing but cats.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   Short code, but that's where I trust the New York Times is not going to do that because
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.760]   it will hurt their brand.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.480]   So there is a negotiation that occurs that says that I will give your, I will give readers
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.040]   their greater relevance and value.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.440]   What I want back is the assurance from Facebook that there's some long term on this number
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.240]   one, number two, uh, after getting the data that, that we have mutual agreement of how
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.160]   to do it and how to do it well in privacy.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.280]   And number three, um, that you will not censor me Facebook according to your supposed
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.880]   community standards as we saw in peruja.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.840]   They're going to agree to that.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.480]   Well, I get Matthew, Matthew, you don't know until you try to negotiate.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.120]   So what you're saying then in the end is that don't even try.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   And then why, why go on a Facebook?
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.520]   What you're really saying is we don't trust them.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   So don't go there.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.480]   And I'm saying that we have to go there.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.800]   And if you have to go there, you try to go there in a way you try to negotiate something.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   We have a small winner negotiate, not negotiating as your responsible.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   Okay.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   Okay.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   We got your point, Jeff.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   Matthew, I'm going to give you a chance to say a final word.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.640]   Well, I think I'm not saying you should not put yourself on Facebook.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.120]   And I'm not even saying that the New York Times shouldn't experiment with instant articles.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.640]   I think, I think what should not happen is you shouldn't expect that Facebook has any
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.760]   interest in you or your journalism or your business model or whether you live or die.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.240]   You are just content.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.160]   And so if your content works for them, then it, then they're happy to keep you on board.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:42.720]   I think the risk is that the central factor that determines your success is out of your
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   control.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   And that is the algorithm.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.040]   Facebook is the one that controls that they move the levers.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.400]   You have zero control over that and always will.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.840]   And I think that's a big risk.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   Let me ask a question.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.840]   No, no, I'm not going to talk anymore about this.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840]   We're moving on.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.520]   Let me ask one last question.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.080]   Why is Facebook doing that?
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.360]   Leo, you can just, if you need to.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   I just, I think we've heard both sides.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360]   All right.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360]   All right.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360]   I was asking a legitimate question.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.040]   I was, why, I'm curious, why Matthew thinks Facebook is doing this at all?
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.040]   What's the benefit to them?
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.240]   I think there's a PR benefit that you mentioned.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:19.120]   I think they want to be seen to be partnering with people and not crushing people under
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.400]   their booty-all.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:25.600]   And I think they believe that some of that content users will engage with it.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.360]   It's very simple to me.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.760]   Facebook would love to own news, period, right?
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   How do you get to own news?
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.600]   Well, the first thing you do is you get the major existing incumbents to give you their
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600]   content.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:42.000]   Then as you win viewers over, you can slowly push them out of the market and you got news.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.520]   Is news something anybody wants to own?
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520]   Well, Facebook does.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.040]   No, Facebook wants attention, right?
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.600]   What they want is your attention.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.760]   They want you to live in Facebook.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.440]   And so to the degree that its users want a variety of content in there, they're going
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.120]   to do everything, all the content deals they can to get content in there.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.800]   They're going to make it look very sweet.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.960]   And you can maybe make a great deal right now.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.160]   Maybe you can negotiate a great deal right now.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.440]   It used to be that what people users wanted was Zinga Games.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   And then they didn't.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   Then when they didn't.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.640]   Now, Zinga's Facebook was their only platform.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   So that's an obvious foolish mistake.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.200]   And it's a foolish mistake with YouTube too.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.840]   Nevertheless, I think that the risk here is that Facebook, it's clear what Facebook wants.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.640]   They want you to live in Facebook, period.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.800]   You know, it's interesting to get back to Google.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.560]   It would be interesting to me, what if Google tried to do something similar?
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.800]   What if Google said, you know, we'll host your articles and we'll show them full length
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.200]   and we'll give you a share of the ad revenue.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.720]   I'd be interested to see what the reaction would be.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.240]   I'm curious, your reaction.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.600]   What would you think about that?
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.320]   I think it'd be better to have two places of doing that than Google.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.680]   Google though, doesn't Google just, Google's business model is different.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.160]   Google wants you to live within Facebook.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.000]   Google wants you to live within the internet.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.520]   That's the opportunity.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.040]   I think what I will say in a post tomorrow is when I think Google can leapfrog here is
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.680]   by saying that if they need Facebook, then they gave you, that's wonderful.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.840]   We're going to enable you to do that anywhere on the internet.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:16.000]   I also should point out that if you're Mark Zuckerberg, you're living in paranoia fear
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.280]   at all times that at some point, your user base, billion and a half strong or whatever
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.880]   it is, my tire of you.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   Yes.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.520]   There isn't really much stickiness to Facebook.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:32.120]   At this point, the only stickiness to Facebook is the network effects, where your family
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.080]   and friends are.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.520]   Now, if it was the only place you could get news, maybe it would be more.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.440]   Isn't Mark's goal at this point to increase stickiness?
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   For sure.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.440]   That's what he needs to do.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:49.160]   Because if he's going to survive, he has to make it very unpleasant for you to switch
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.600]   to some other network.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.200]   That's all your friends and family, this switching cost.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   Content's not a switching cost.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.400]   Well, that's an interesting point then.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.440]   Shouldn't he be doing everything he can to make sure that your friends and family stick
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   around?
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.560]   I mean, I'm sure that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't go to bed at night content in the success
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.560]   that is Facebook.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:15.120]   I'm sure that every day, he's worried and he should be because the internet, ultimately,
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.560]   the internet is a pretty frictionless environment.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.440]   How are you feeling about Facebook these days?
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.440]   I hate it.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.600]   He should be worried about any trust.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.800]   Well, he's got a lot of people's being, you know, that's a sad thing.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.080]   Same thing as Google.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.880]   You get really successful in this country.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.480]   It's hard to hold on.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.680]   It's better to be slightly successful.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.680]   Like me.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.240]   But it's interesting that Facebook is doing lots of stuff that's...
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.840]   Don't stick your head up.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.240]   Just stay in your go for a hole.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.400]   Facebook is doing lots of stuff that's just as likely to draw.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.400]   I agree.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.680]   Handy trust attention to Google, if not more.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   I agree.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   But that's why it's very interesting that they got a deal with actual Springer who threw
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   a build while...
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.480]   It's a daring game.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.280]   And Mark Zuckerberg didn't get where he is without walking that edge.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.560]   And I think that that's smart and fascinating.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.520]   And ultimately, Mark's got all the money he'll ever need for many, many, many lifetimes.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.120]   So it ain't about that anymore.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   Never has been.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.240]   But I'll be interested to see if this venture, instant articles, lasts any longer than the
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240]   social readers that Washington Post and Guardian came up with.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.080]   If you look at Facebook and all of its initiatives over the last three years, how many have stuck
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080]   around?
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   Very few.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080]   Lots are gone.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080]   Lots of failures.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080]   Lots of people have come in.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.200]   We talk all the time about the things Google's abandoned.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.920]   Facebook abandoned stuff right and left.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   Constantly.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.240]   So in fact, all of this may be at Tempest and T-Puck because in three months instant articles
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   might just be...
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240]   What's next?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240]   Mark, clearly there's no...
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   The users don't like it.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   Right.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   Right.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   Well, that's exactly what Matt's saying.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   Right.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.920]   Well, but that's a content career.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.880]   You have no say in really the...
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   Oh, but that's zero.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.520]   That's a slight difference and nuance there.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.880]   If Facebook says...
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.440]   But Facebook always tries to make the best...
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.880]   Facebook and Google both try to make the best user experience.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.160]   The Washington Post Guardian thing was not a good user experience.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.280]   If this is a good user experience, Facebook will stick by it.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.920]   If it's a bad user experience, no matter how good it is for publishers, it won't matter.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.320]   So users are paramount in this.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.560]   And I will say that the reason why Facebook is in a position to do this and why it's such
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:37.920]   an appealing job, lots of news companies have done a terrible job of producing usable mobile
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.880]   apps, a good user experience.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.720]   So Facebook, by comparison, looks fantastic.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   All right.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.880]   We're going to take a break.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.920]   I think this is a good conversation and I'm glad we actually extended a little bit.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.720]   Sorry, I thought it was fun.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.280]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   It is.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.760]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   And it's what we talk about.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.360]   Well, I'm glad Matthew and I are at the same time because I knew we would see this from
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360]   different perspectives.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   That's good.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.360]   All right, good Matthew.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360]   Let's talk mattresses.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.880]   Let's lie down in peace.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.720]   Let's lie down in peace with Casper.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.880]   You spend so much of your time lying on a mattress and yet how much time did you spend
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.480]   buying that mattress?
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.080]   Maybe five, 10 minutes in a mattress store.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.240]   I know because I did it recently.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.760]   Casper is so much better.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:35.160]   In a way, this is an interesting, they've made a necessity, a virtue out of a necessity.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.640]   If you're going to sell mattresses on the internet, well, people are going to naturally
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.520]   say, well, how do I know if I like it?
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.720]   So what Casper says is you have 100 days to decide or 100 nights, I guess.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.840]   You don't have to lie down in a showroom.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.520]   It has nothing to do with whether that mattress is going to work for you.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.280]   I want you to order a Casper mattress right now.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.800]   You could buy it online.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   It's easy to buy.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.440]   It comes in a box, which is awesome.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.720]   Makes it very easy to get even a king size mattress into a little tiny space.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:10.520]   We got king size for my son who lives on the third floor and he loves it.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   Loves it.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   You probably have to get him another one.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   I don't know if he's going to be able to get it out of his room.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.720]   He's moving this next semester.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.040]   Latex and memory foam come together to give you both the firmness you want and the sink
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040]   and bounce you need.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040]   Look at this.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040]   Watch this.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.480]   Here's an elderly man jumping on that mattress and man, does he like it?
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.880]   He loves it.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.360]   And beauty of this is if you don't like it, you have 100 days to decide.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   They'll take it back.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.840]   No cost to you.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   I love Casper.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   You're going to love it too.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.280]   An online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost made in the US of
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.640]   A, 500 for a twin 950 for a king size.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.920]   Compare that to the premium mattress in your mattress.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.080]   In your mattress store, you'll see it's a good deal.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.520]   And we're going to give you $50 off because you're listening to the show at Casper.com/twig.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.720]   C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twig.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.820]   Love my Casper.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.080]   You will too.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   That's an example of it.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.320]   Sometimes people think we should only do tech ads.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.800]   And I guess in internet companies, kind of disintermediating the traditional brick and
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.600]   mortar store, that's a tech company in a way.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.440]   But I just do stuff I like.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.680]   Frankly, got products I like.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.080]   The national, the House of Representatives has passed the USA Freedom Act today, minutes
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.240]   ago, 338 to 88.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.600]   It will head to the Senate where, of course, Mitch McConnell hates it because he hates
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.040]   freedom.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.640]   So it may not pass the Senate, but it has passed the House.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.800]   This of course is the bill that would back up the recent court decision about bulk collection
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.760]   of telephone records.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.160]   The USA Freedom Act would limit the bulk collection of telephone records and allow companies
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.360]   to challenge gag orders imposed by national security letters.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.760]   This was the other side of that coin was if you got a national security letter, you weren't
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.080]   allowed to tell anybody that the data was being collected.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.520]   The bill replaces bulk collection with a system that requires actual court orders to search
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   data on a case-by-case basis.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.000]   Gosh, a constitutional law.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.640]   Holy cow.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.880]   Are these guys nuts?
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   Great idea.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.920]   It's probably one of those that needs a super majority in the Senate, which is, of course,
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.560]   going to be impossible.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   In fact, in November, they voted on this similar USA Freedom Act that got 58 votes in the Senate,
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.480]   which is too short of the super majority needed.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.480]   Open letter to the Senate urging them to pass the USA Freedom Act last year from Apple,
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.040]   Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.160]   Of course, these are all the companies who get those national security letters and can't
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   tell you.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.560]   So we'll watch with interest, right?
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.640]   This is time to write your Congress critic, write your Senator, especially if you're in
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.280]   Kentucky, write to Mitch McConnell and say, "You know what?
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.720]   We want this.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.040]   We want this bill to pass.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.240]   We expect it to pass.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.880]   We got this thing called the Fourth Amendment.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.480]   Ever hear of it?
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.080]   I just got on my horse, but I thought everybody else was on a horse.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.080]   I should ride along with you."
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.880]   Giddy up.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.200]   Giddy up.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.160]   Giddy up.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.080]   So I've been wearing the Apple Watch.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   Maybe I don't know.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.080]   Maybe you have defective.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.080]   I don't know.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.920]   Do you like it?
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.640]   You know, they're all the same, really.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.760]   The Apple Watch is a little prettier.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.840]   I made the mistake of buying the LG or Bain.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.360]   It looked good on the page, and then I put it on.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360]   Everybody said, "What is that?
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360]   Ugly watch.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   You get that under a bridge.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   Where'd you get that?"
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.000]   Somebody's selling it out of his trunk of his car.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.400]   It doesn't look so bad.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]   This is the Apple Watch.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   Of course, it doesn't look bad.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   It's $700.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400]   That was $700?
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.480]   That was $700?
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.560]   Stainless steel with a Milanese loop, 700 Schmacher-Rous.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   But they're all about the same.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.880]   Really seriously, they all do about the same thing.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.600]   Do you look at your phone less?
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.400]   No, because a lot of the stuff you want to do is easier on your phone, even though you
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   could do it on the watch at such a teensy-week.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.640]   It's like a postage stamp.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.560]   I look less when I'm working on work.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   I can look at the...
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560]   I don't need that.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.360]   Actually, I prefer Android, and I really like Android Wear.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.120]   Especially the new Android Wear on the Airbane.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.600]   I really, really like it.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.800]   But this watch is less offensive.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.600]   Do you have a watch, Matthew?
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.000]   This kind of watch?
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.520]   No, I have a Timex Ironman that was 35.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520]   I think it's Walmart.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.360]   He is an Ironman.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.800]   Google has an Apple Watch app.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.280]   Google News and Weather.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.560]   Google rejects 70% of the quarter of a million right to be forgotten requests.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560]   70%?
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.920]   If that's a different number from what we've heard in the past.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.240]   It didn't seem like it was that.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.480]   It was a majority in the past.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   I thought in the past...
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.480]   Yeah, that's a lot.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   It was...
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   I don't know.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480]   It might have been.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480]   Really?
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.880]   Anyway, that's good news.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:27.320]   They've received 253,617 requests, about 500 a day now down from the original 1,500 a day.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.640]   I don't know if they'll be compelled to say yes.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.480]   Oh, initially Google was refusing just 43%.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.480]   Ah, okay, there you go.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:44.280]   And according to the article in the esteemed IBT...
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:51.800]   IBT owns Newsweek, International Business Times owns Newsweek.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.840]   Both of them have become rags.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840]   Yep.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:03.800]   In the news week, ever retract the story about Bitcoin being created by a guy in Southern
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.440]   California, I don't believe so.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.480]   They just waited for people to forget.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.480]   Forget.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.480]   Oh, man.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.840]   That was one of the worst cover stories in recent memory.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.880]   It was their relaunch of their paper version.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   And it was wrong, wrong, wrong.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   It was a great story.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.880]   I wanted to believe it.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   It was really well written.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   But it was fascinating.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   It fell apart.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.680]   It was just totally wrong.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.160]   They didn't hire Columbia University to check their abrasities like a Roman Stone did.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.160]   Hey, so speaking of which Brian Williams...
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.160]   And the two of you do.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160]   Oh, what's the latest?
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160]   What was he done?
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160]   I thought he was.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.360]   Is that true?
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360]   It's...
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.000]   If I were Brian, I would say, yeah, yeah, I'm gone.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Don't stop investigating.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Yeah, gotta go.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.960]   They're going through his junior high school transcripts now.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.600]   It's just getting worse or worse.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.640]   No, I guess there's no final.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.720]   I just listened to Brokaw and Fresh Air on NPR.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.240]   I was pretty shocked that Terry Gross didn't ask him.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   Brokaw's now saying...
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.200]   I've done more to say, but at least ask him so you can hear him say...
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   So, so...
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200]   I don't want to talk about that.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200]   Fox News asked him.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.440]   Fox News asked him.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.360]   And he told Fox News, he said, "Brian's at the point where he is, I gather, trying to
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.440]   decide how he's going to respond."
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.440]   Right.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.480]   A little late for that.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.280]   And now after the probe, it was originally just two or three allegations.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.920]   And now there's ten.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.920]   So...
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.920]   I always liked Brian.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.480]   Nice guy.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.000]   Told a great story.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.500]   Really good.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.320]   And you know, really isn't that what a news...
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.480]   Isn't that what a news anchors job is, is to tell...
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.320]   Isn't that our job?
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.040]   Tell me, Professor of Journalism at City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis, isn't
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.840]   journalism the job of telling a story?
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.080]   Look, you cannot reproduce the truth.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.600]   That shouldn't be true.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   Should it not?
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.760]   It shouldn't be a lie, but there's truth and there's truthiness.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.920]   Isn't the job...
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.600]   Our job, everybody, is to make sense of a random set of...
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:17.440]   Almost seemingly random set of facts by telling a story around it that's compelling and kind
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.640]   of makes it make sense and it helps us understand it, because the story is how humans understand
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   things.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:30.440]   And sometimes a cleverly added, crafted non-fact will help the overall factfulness.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   No?
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.440]   I don't think we are...
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.440]   You're maybe the storytellers.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440]   You don't?
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   No.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.800]   I think that that's the form we took.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.640]   If we truly look at how we serve communities with information, I think we're more than
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   that.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.320]   Stories are one of the tools we'll have.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.640]   But Brian Williams is special about when I listened to this Brokaw thing on Fresh Air.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.680]   And you're right, Matthew.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.160]   Maybe it was cut down because it was pledge week, so maybe there was a longer version.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   Oh, geez.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.560]   Version I heard her nothing.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.880]   But the... and Brokaw's a good guy, but the ego inherent in what he said is an anchor.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.480]   He talked about 9/11 and it was...
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.520]   He debated about what should he prepare?
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.160]   He should prepare the nation for this or that.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.720]   The hubris and the anchors.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.720]   That is hubris.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.720]   Oh, amazing.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.720]   And that's what our supporters are probably...
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.920]   But let me get... this is what I hear in my mind.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.680]   A reporter's job is to gather facts and deliver them, period, right?
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680]   And explain things...
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   Less so explained.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680]   Mine experts.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   Less so explained.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680]   There's more just to gather facts.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   I mean, obviously there...
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.000]   In the reporter's mind, there has to be some sort of overarching story.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.600]   But really, it's to gather and deliver facts.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.640]   But an anchor maybe is like a meta reporter whose job it is to interpret the facts and
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.440]   tell us stories so the American people can understand.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   No, it's to read.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   It's to read a teleporter.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440]   Right.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.200]   And I think you could argue that Brian Williams, in fact, I have argued, the Brian Williams
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:58.440]   and the entire concept of a celebrity anchor who sits there and kind of interprets the
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.040]   news is an antiquated... like that worked in the '40s and '50s.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.040]   Yeah, it didn't Walter Cronkite.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:11.120]   Didn't Walter Cronkite after going to Vietnam and assessing the story end up saying this
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.880]   is a war we cannot win and changed overnight America's opinion of Vietnam and LBJ.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.360]   He certainly helped change.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   But I think a guy like Brian Williams, he's a pleasant voice and he provides...
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.840]   He's a talking head.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.440]   He's a hero too.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.320]   He's a hairdoian with a mouth.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.560]   To some extent, I thought it was odd that people were expecting him to somehow be a
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.120]   journalist.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.920]   That was not my expectation at all.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.040]   What's it like in Canada these days, Matthew?
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.800]   What do you mean?
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:52.800]   In terms of the anchors on the national view of anchors, what's it like?
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.440]   Is it same as the US?
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.480]   We like Peter Mansbridge because he's been around for 100 years and he refused to go
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.760]   to the US and stayed in Canada.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.560]   Is he like the nightly news anchor on the CBC or something?
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.360]   Yeah, he's kind of the eminence squeeze of anchors.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.720]   But I mean that whole position to me is kind of farcical in a way.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:18.800]   It just makes no sense to have this one guy or even woman who sits there and kind of
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   interprets the news.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   You know, I can do that.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:27.040]   And I don't think Walter Cronkite would have made up a story to underscore his opinion
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.920]   that Vietnam was unwinnable, right?
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920]   I doubt it.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.520]   He doesn't seem like that would have happened.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   It had it happened.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.800]   It would have been just a scandalous then as it would be now.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:41.480]   But I think Brian, it was all about the delivery and the story and the feeling and conveying
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   the emotion.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.840]   And so it didn't really matter what the specific details were.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.080]   You know, he missed read.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.800]   I think he misread the American public.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   He thought that was his job.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.440]   I mean, if he speaks out on this, that's probably what he should say, which is, I'm
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.440]   sorry.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.840]   I thought I was supposed to do that.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840]   Really?
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.840]   That's what I'd say.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.080]   I'm betting he's not going to say that.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.560]   I don't know.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.560]   I misunderstood.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.080]   I thought I saw in the memo that I was supposed to make up facts to substantiate my opinion.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.520]   Is that not?
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.120]   So so here's the here's the point.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   You part though.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.120]   I mean, Brian Williams, he said he thought it was a nice guy.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.120]   He's right.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   I'm mad at him.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   I think he's great.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   I've worked with him destroyed.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.520]   Oh, well, what how what's what's your he's got plenty of money in the bank, plenty of
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   money.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.160]   He was he was like the host of all sorts of things.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.440]   He could be the host of America's funniest home videos.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.240]   He's still very I think he's well liked.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   Yeah, he's so anything.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:39.720]   There should be nobody ever says, Hey Carson daily, you made that up.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.720]   Right.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.600]   Nobody ever says, you know, how come how come?
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.320]   I mean, it's yes, he could be a TV host, which is really what he was.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   And he just didn't understand.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   Right.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   Exactly.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   He didn't understand.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.320]   He'll write a reality show.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   He was it's a reality show.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   He was the host of a reality.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.640]   Yeah, he misunderstood.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.840]   I think so you sure as they think that he could be you get hired for a show?
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   Good.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   More Don.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.080]   I'm a Scott rehired.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   Our valbert got rehired.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Sure.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.200]   We're America loves to forgive the center.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   Just not the news.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.720]   He could have a talk show in a second, but you're $10.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.040]   He's talking of five different people.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   You could do the tomorrow show.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.960]   You're right.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.640]   What is this story in the Wall Street Journal?
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.160]   How Google's top minds decide what to forget?
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.160]   That's the right to be forgotten.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.360]   That's more right to be forgotten.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.480]   So who is on this panel?
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.480]   Not personally.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.560]   They don't decide what to personally forget.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.880]   That's what I thought.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   Never mind.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.280]   I was all excited about the headline.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.800]   Larry Page and Elon Musk meeting in.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.000]   Yeah, secret apartment.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   Secret apartment.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   Secret apartment.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   That's fastening.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   On the moon.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.360]   Picture happening, right?
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.120]   We picture the meeting in some secret location, you know, it's like a spaceship and they're
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.480]   talking about robot armies and stuff like that.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.240]   It's like a John LeCarene novel.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.360]   It's like a safe house.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.320]   I'll meet you in the secret apartment.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   Exactly.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:18.320]   We're going to get Tony Stark's, you know, lair.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.280]   This is from Ashley Vance's new book on Elon Musk.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.200]   We're going to get Ashley's going to join us on the triangulation in a couple of weeks
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.120]   to talk about his book.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.080]   So what a great revelation.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.520]   Google even has its own chef on call to prepare food for people who are allowed to stay in
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.880]   the apartment.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.400]   I want to see the apartment.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.120]   I want to see this apartment.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.120]   Like is it an apartment?
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.120]   I want to see.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.120]   You know it.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.280]   Well, if you Elon Musk comes to town to meet with Larry, they're not going to put him
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280]   up in the Sheraton.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.000]   They have a nice place for him.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.160]   Greg Zachary, a venture capitalist, a friend of Musk was at one of the meetings he's described
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.080]   it to Ashley Vance saying, I was there once.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.360]   And Elon was talking about building an electric jet plane that could land off, take off and
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.840]   land vertically.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.600]   Larry said the plane should be able to land on ski slopes.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.600]   And Sergey said it needs it needs to be able to dock an apartment.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.320]   Man, man.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.360]   Then they started talking about building a commuter plane that was always circling the
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.360]   earth.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.840]   Yeah, like you hop onto it and you get places incredibly fast.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:29.800]   Zachary said, I thought everyone was kidding, but at the end I asked Elon, are you really
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.440]   going to do that?
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   And he said, yeah, dude.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.240]   I think Elon watches basically Avengers movies and Ironman movies.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.200]   And then he just comes up with ideas like the jet, you know, take off and land like it's
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   basically right out of all trust.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.480]   Actually, isn't he our Thomas Edison?
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.240]   I, you know, well, and now it depends on how you feel about Edison.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.880]   Well, because there are those who quite rightly think that Edison was a poser.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.640]   He was a patent troll.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.640]   So who is he?
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640]   He stole ideas.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.520]   That's how he got his.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.960]   That's how he got started was his art Tesla.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   He's our Tesla Tesla Tesla.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   It's a Tesla was cookie.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.560]   Yeah, Tesla was kind of nuts.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.000]   We know Elon is a little a week ago.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.760]   We had we were talking about Elon's power wall on Twitter.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   It was great.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   And Jason Calicanis who happens to no Tesla Tesla.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.000]   No, I'm sure J.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   I'm sure J.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.160]   He owns the first Tesla number one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.960]   And he's building Jason is invested in a company that's building a demo of a two mile
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   demo of the hyperloop.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   Nice.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.040]   But he was very bullish on this power wall.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.720]   He says, and I think he might be right.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.440]   You don't understand Elon Musk has just solved global warming.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.840]   Like this is that important.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.240]   What do you think it could be?
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240]   I think it could be.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   It could be too.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.040]   Made a compelling case for it.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.960]   I know I want one.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.760]   Like he lines a super smart guy.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:04.160]   But I think the most important thing about him is he just comes up with these things and
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.160]   some a normal person would say, well, obviously we're not going to launch a rocket because
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.160]   that's really hard.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   It's super expensive.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160]   Right.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.160]   And we're not going to build a completely new form of transportation called the hyperloop.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.600]   But Elon is like, well, why not.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.760]   It turns out this was good.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.000]   Jason understood this better because he didn't invest in it.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.600]   But really the hyperloop's biggest benefit is not people, but freight because we spend
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.560]   a huge amount of money and there's a huge global impact to trans shipping stuff from
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.480]   China, the United States and container ships.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:42.240]   And what he says, the real plan is to build an underwater hyperloop that trans that ships
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:48.040]   because so what the freight gets if something goes wrong, you lost some Apple watches, not
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.720]   no humans die.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   So interesting.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:57.360]   Well, if I think that the hyperloop, I'm fascinated by it and I fantasize about taking it, you
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.480]   know, going to California in 45 minutes, but it's got to be a claustrophobic experience.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.760]   I don't think the hyperloop is a good idea for humans, not to mention the issues of the
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.760]   acceleration.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.640]   You're basically in a pneumatic tube.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.080]   I don't want to do it.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.640]   But but but again, under the speed, yeah, it's a billion dollars for people moving and
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.840]   look at our train systems falling apart because nobody takes trains.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.880]   So it doesn't seem like a great idea, but as a freight mover.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   Well, and that actually compares to I was reading something the other day about self-driving
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   trucks.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.680]   So there's a prototype.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:36.560]   So the the actual the the benefit of self-driving vehicles might actually be more on the freight
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.520]   side and delivery side than on human the human side.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.960]   The apartment is a is a high rise in downtown Palo Alto with views of the mountains surrounding
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.280]   Stanford's campus.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:52.800]   And is during such meetings at Google's secretive apartment, I got to talk to Ashley about this
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.680]   that Musk page and Brynn began to brainstorm ideas that turn into projects.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:01.080]   It's kind of our recreation, I guess page told Vance.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.120]   It's fun for the three of us to talk about kind of crazy things.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:08.560]   We find stuff that eventually turns out to be real.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.640]   We go through hundreds or thousands of possible things before arriving at the ones that are
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.640]   most promising.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.640]   Is that your Waynes world?
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.400]   Party on party on.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.400]   Party on.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.400]   Party on.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   Elon.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   Okay.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:30.040]   By the way, the Google you talk self driving the Google self driving cars.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   One point seven.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040]   I don't know.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040]   Is this one of your numbers, Jeff?
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.240]   I hope not one point seven million miles.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:41.900]   Well, 11 accidents, but in every case it was humans that caused the accidents.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:50.500]   The most common accidents are in typical, it was mostly not on the highways, all on streets.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:56.900]   And mostly like fender, like rear endings, you can't stop somebody from re-ending you.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.900]   No.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.900]   Plus people, you know what this thing is, this thing is a magnet from, oh my God, look what's
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:01.900]   there, Brian.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.900]   Look, George.
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.900]   Whoops.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.060]   So according.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:11.740]   I heard the point made that they should have reported this number earlier.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.220]   Yeah, but I think it would have been widely misunderstood because you cannot control people
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.860]   plowing into you.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:18.060]   They were t-boned once.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.860]   They were rear ended a bunch of times.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.340]   It wasn't their fault.
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:24.740]   Although they say, hey, but we're working on ways to avoid places where accidents are
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.340]   more likely to happen or be more careful in intersections like that.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:32.420]   But look, they could see 600 feet in front of your 600 yards in front of them.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.740]   They do not much better.
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:34.740]   Here's the stat.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:39.340]   660,000 people at any given moment in the United States.
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:43.380]   60,000 people are behind the wheel and not looking at the road.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.020]   They're checking their devices.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.180]   I don't know where that number.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.180]   That's a great number.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.180]   I don't know where it comes from.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.660]   Distraction.gov.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:53.580]   Well, that's got to be real.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:57.540]   That's a couple of years is distracted.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.540]   Distraction.gov.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.780]   I'm sure that should be Congress's site.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:03.780]   I know.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:04.780]   I like this.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.780]   This is my site.
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:06.780]   This is my new site.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.700]   Distraction.gov.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:15.060]   10% of all drivers under the age of 20 killed in fatal crashes reported as distracted at
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.340]   the time of the crash.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.660]   Any given day, this is from NOPUS and OPUS.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:27.780]   At any given daylight moment across the US, 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:31.780]   manipulating electronic devices while driving.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:39.860]   600, this is from a report from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:43.300]   Driver electronic use in 2011.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.380]   We have the most recent year.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.180]   We have these by gender.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:50.740]   More females in males.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.220]   Considerably more females in males.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:56.740]   That's this one over the black one.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:03.020]   However, handheld cell phone use by age, it goes down as you get older.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:08.460]   Only about 1% of folks over 70 use cell phones while driving.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.980]   Although they have other problems.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.860]   Number doubled in 2011 to 2%.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.260]   16 to 24, 7%.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:21.300]   It has been as high as 10%.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.700]   Drivers holding phones to ears while driving.
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:29.340]   Was there a survey where they looked at the amount of accidents while people were fiddling
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.340]   with the radio?
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:31.340]   No.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.540]   That's got to be just as high, right?
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.340]   Or arguing with your husband?
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:35.340]   Right.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.900]   Or thinking or will gathering.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.700]   Or reaching behind to get to pick up the kids bottle.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:45.980]   The percentage of drivers visibly manipulating handheld devices while driving increasingly.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.180]   0.9% in 2010, 1.3% in 2011.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.180]   Still not.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:55.060]   1% that's why you get 660,000 I guess.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:35:02.460]   Anyway, this is a good bunch of statistics.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:06.420]   NOPUS, what is NOPUS?
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:14.780]   Some sort of, I guess, NOPUS is the National Occupant Protection Use Survey conducted annually
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:20.160]   by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.160]   Administration.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.240]   I guess they actually look.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.160]   They put observers out there and extrapolate.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:35.780]   I wonder how many there will be when people look at their watches.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:41.660]   Yeah, now that I can manipulate my watch, send a heartbeat as I die in a crash.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.300]   Well, no, the problem is hard for you inside.
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:55.680]   Since you don't worry, the problem is when you have to use the watch, you've got to go
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.680]   like this.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.120]   No, Apple watches doesn't require that much of a jerk.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120]   Does it?
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120]   No.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   Yeah, and I, you know, I guess, yeah, it'd be hard to send a heartbeat while you're driving
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120]   because it takes two hands.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:14.200]   Hey, I'm thrilled that Ed Felton is now our deputy US CTO.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.200]   That is a stunner.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200]   Great news.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.640]   Ed Felton, a Princeton professor who has done a lot of work.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:28.480]   In fact, I think, walked the line on copy protection on DRM.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480]   Really smart guy.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.380]   He's published more than 100 papers of two books on technology law and policy.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.380]   And he's...
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.380]   Great choice.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.720]   Yeah, boy, amazing.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:45.020]   I mean, Ed was kind of one of the outlaws who really was pushing these research into things
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.560]   like DRM and encryption.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560]   Wow.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.200]   Couldn't be a better choice.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.480]   Now they said they got Megan as the CTO, right?
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   Is Megan Smith CTO?
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.440]   Well, I can't remember.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.440]   Yes.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.120]   Yeah, and Ed Felton, who is the Robert E. Kahn professor of computer science at Public
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.640]   Affairs at Princeton.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   He used to work at the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, so I guess he has some experience
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.560]   in government.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.440]   I'm pretty sure that was...
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:21.240]   Someone mentioned that Ed Felton was Aaron Swartz's suggestion as CTO.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240]   Couldn't be better.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240]   Really?
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.240]   I mean, it really couldn't be.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.240]   It's good news.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.000]   I mean, somebody who really understands what's going on as a place at the table.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.600]   I'm very happy about that.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.960]   There's some good news.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:39.200]   I'm trying to remember how to use an iPhone.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.280]   Do you want to do that Facebook?
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.640]   I'm sitting here with one.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.840]   I don't see the Facebook.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:44.840]   It looks so ridiculous.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   I know.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]   It's so primitive, isn't it?
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   Wow.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.080]   Don't you feel like iPhones are kind of primitive?
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.000]   I was using someone's the other day and it felt like I was using a Barbie phone.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.920]   You know, from me, from the kids.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.760]   I swear to God, I could not fit my phone.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.560]   I was the Ken phone.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.560]   You have which one?
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.560]   The Ken phone.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.560]   You have the Ken phone.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.120]   No, the what?
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   That's very sexist of you.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.840]   Trying to add to your joke there.
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.840]   Oh, sorry, Barbie.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.840]   I got it.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.840]   I got it.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:13.840]   Do they have Canon Canada?
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.840]   Or is he named Bruce or something?
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.040]   No, they have Ken.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.040]   That's called Ken.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.040]   Pretty sure Ken's still around.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.040]   Okay.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.120]   I've been using the Nexus 6, actually.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   But you have.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.040]   How do you like it?
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.040]   I love it.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.840]   You're getting ready for Google Fi, aren't you?
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.400]   Well, when I first started using it, I thought this is way too big.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.960]   It's just way too big.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.640]   I thought I'm never going to get comfortable with it.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.520]   And now, if I try to use the old Nexus 4 or an iPhone, I'm like, what are these tiny
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   phones?
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   Oh, that's what you mean by Barbie.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.600]   It's kind of like just precious and small.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.720]   So you didn't lose your phone in Italy, did you?
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.240]   No, I had the phone in my pocket and I had my passport in my pocket.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.080]   Oh, thank goodness you had the passport.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.320]   Actually, what's going to put it in my back and forgot?
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.560]   Oh, what's going to get a Chromebook Pixel?
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   I'm thinking about it.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.440]   You know who's got a Chromebook as my mom?
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.400]   The place that she lives, the retirement home, is doing a trial of Chromebooks.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.320]   And so she's got one.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.320]   He's trying out.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.520]   So they've got Wi-Fi throughout the place and they've given out some Chromebooks.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.640]   I'm not sure she's going to use it, but it's a good idea.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:32.520]   I want to thank one of our viewers for sending me an email.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.680]   He's a first trainer.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:37.400]   You know about first, it's the robotics competition that's done in high school.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.600]   Steve Wozniak is a first coach.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.400]   It's a really cool thing.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:49.120]   The championship is something that high school students work all year towards and it's just
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.600]   a great way to teach robotics.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.240]   Has been up to now using Lego Mindstorms, the NLX chip as its controller.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.760]   The announcement last, I guess it was in March, that they're going to start using Android.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.920]   The new platform for first features robot and driver's station controls based on a snap
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:13.320]   dragon processor, handheld devices, Android devices.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.160]   They're going to be working on a Java platform, of course, because that's how Android works.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.960]   So that's really good news because it means there'll be a whole generation of kids who
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.480]   are expert Android programmers.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.360]   And the Android devices, you always need a smart device to control these things.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.280]   And it makes sense because it's an inexpensive smartphone.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.000]   In fact, Microsoft announced something similar with its Windows 10 for the Internet of Things,
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.560]   a platform for not just the Raspberry Pi, but also Windows phones to be control the
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.200]   Raspberry Pi and others.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.040]   So this is exciting.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.520]   It's good news, frankly.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:41:00.560]   And glad we stole it away from the Lego oligopoly.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.440]   So you haven't bought a computer yet to replace the stolen one.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.600]   I have not.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.680]   I just got a Fortune MacBook Pro though.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.680]   Oh, I see.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:13.840]   It's got one of those inventory labels on the back that kind of spoils the fun.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.560]   It sure does.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.400]   I'm thinking of putting my Iron Man sticker over top of it.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.240]   Good.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.840]   You don't use Android on first robotics.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.880]   Well, I think that's the new thing.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.520]   Is the idea that's the new thing.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.920]   Something that Chatham's saying you don't do that.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.400]   Maybe I misunderstood.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.720]   But I'm looking at the first press release that says you do.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.800]   So I think that's authoritative.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.120]   I'm going to take a break and when we come back, we're going to have kind of the back
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.680]   of the book matter.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.680]   Tools and tips.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.280]   Oh, it feels like Windows weekly.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.280]   Yes.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.120]   I like this back of the book concept.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.280]   Nobody really knows what I'm talking about because nobody has read magazines in years.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:55.680]   Yeah, but your book.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.240]   You remember in the old days, the computer magazines at the back of it would have the
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.240]   fun stuff.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.440]   What's my age?
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.120]   They had the ads for the X-rays facts and the comic books.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.120]   It was the good stuff.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.120]   One man submarine.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.120]   You know, yeah.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.120]   Made it a cardboard.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.720]   What was the little C people?
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.720]   Yes.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.720]   C monkeys.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.720]   Brian shrimp.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.720]   Black soap, right?
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.720]   You'd wash with it.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   Yeah, that's pretty.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   Turn your black.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.160]   It's a gag everybody loves.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.280]   Hey, are you looking for work?

[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.120]   Jeff Jarvis is here for the professor of a journalism city university of New York, the
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:04.360]   author of what would Google do, public parts, geek sparing news, geek sparing gifts.
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.720]   And of course he blogs at buzzmachine.com and he has a number for us, I'm sure.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.960]   I first, I first, I want to apologize to Matthew.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.960]   I did.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.960]   I ended up in the discussion.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.640]   I really enjoyed it, but I think I got too headed up and interrupted you.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:23.600]   I want to make sure that I was for the discussion and I always enjoyed doing this.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.520]   But I, you know, here's what I imagine that this is kind of a mirror image of the discussion
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.960]   you had with your students.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.680]   And that was probably the fast, back and forth, early, early kind of thing.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:35.680]   So you were like, so excited.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.680]   I do.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.680]   I do, which is good.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:39.680]   But I just want to, I want to salute Matthew.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680]   We love the back and forth.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.200]   Or make sure that we have a group hug virtual hug.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.480]   I got a secret apartment at Palo Alto, you guys.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.640]   It's like, it's like, did you watch the Howard Stern, David Letterman kiss?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   No, no.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.640]   Was there a tongue?
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.000]   No, it was Howard tried to kiss Letterman.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.480]   And what I can only imagine with Letterman.
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:06.400]   That would be a friend of the video is the, you do your number and I will find the video.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   You find that.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.400]   Okay.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.360]   I'm going to do all Sheryl Sandberg, who's back at work amazingly, just announced moments
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:19.960]   ago that Facebook is going to give us contractors $15 an hour minimum, 15 days off and 4,000
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960]   for parental benefits.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960]   Is that good?
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:22.960]   They are nice people.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.800]   Does that sound pretty good?
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.960]   Better than being in some poor schlub who gets absolutely no benefits.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.520]   You know, benefits are always good.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.280]   Here's the late show, ladies and gentlemen, or we could do as a member.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280]   Okay.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280]   Good.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   There's the lovely Howard Stern in a three piece suit.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:38.080]   That's it.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.320]   Don Rickles is coming on later, right?
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320]   Listen to my hero.
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.960]   What is Letterman's got a slurpee?
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.520]   They have a way of milkshakes.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.520]   Okay.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.520]   James doesn't know I know this.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.840]   He invited Don to go to dinner with him after the show.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:52.000]   You think I was invited?
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.960]   I wasn't invited.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   Terrible.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.960]   Terrible.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.640]   But I don't want to go anyway, believe me.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.280]   Howard, listen to you two guys.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.680]   Once again, yeah.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:03.440]   First of all, I didn't realize it was Carnaby Street night.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:12.320]   Oh, no, this is where he tries to kiss him.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320]   Come over here.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320]   Come on.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320]   Come here.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.200]   Is this our final time together?
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.200]   Come here.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.200]   No, no, what are you gonna do?
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:22.200]   Come on.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.200]   Come here.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.200]   Come here.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.200]   Oh, he kisses his hand.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:26.200]   He knows.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.840]   I think he has senses that something's something unpleasant is about to happen.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.680]   Oh, oh, he's trying to kiss him on the...
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.840]   I think Letterman is kind of a misinthrope.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.920]   He's like one of those guys doesn't like to be touched, right?
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.760]   Oh, he's laughing.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.920]   He's laughing.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.840]   He's laughing, but he's crying on the inside.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.200]   Plus, Howard's like seven feet tall or something.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.200]   He looks huge.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.760]   He's a scary man.
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.760]   All right.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:52.760]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.800]   You're the other number of the week is that every day of this week is a palindrome.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.800]   That's right.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.800]   In America.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.760]   Only in the American way of things.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:01.760]   Only in America.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:08.760]   Five, thirteen, fifteen, five, one, three, one, five, which is the same backwards and forwards.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.680]   And it is all week.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.680]   In America.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.680]   In America.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.680]   What would it be?
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.760]   Do you do date, date, month, year in the Canadian Rockies?
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.040]   You know what's funny is some people do and some people don't.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.000]   It's a little like we're trapped in here.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.280]   It's a Britishism.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:34.760]   I do, after reading Strunk and White, where they, E.B. White, encourages you to write
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.080]   dates in a sensible way where the numbers are separated so there's no confusion.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:43.840]   So I do write my dates, thirteen, May, twenty, fifteen.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.080]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.120]   There's a good reason for that because you're separating the numbers.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.000]   Well, in day, month, year, I mean, month, day, year makes no sense once more.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.640]   It doesn't sort right, right?
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.600]   Actually, computer geeks always write year, month, day.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.040]   Because then it was--
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.880]   And the fun thing about filling out online forms is sometimes they will want it like
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.040]   federal things.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.520]   Sometimes they want it year, month, day.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.520]   I know.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.880]   Sometimes they want it month, day, year.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:18.440]   Well, and it's very confusing for us Americans when we travel on those custom forms.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.840]   You have to read it carefully.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.840]   But you know what's odd?
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.040]   I think the American customs forms are also day, month, year, which is--
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.720]   Maybe because a lot of ferners come in.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.880]   So can I do it one more here?
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.240]   So I just-- thanks to Vic Condotra who linked to the Facebook thing.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.960]   I just finally got Facebook working on this.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.040]   You can see.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   So there's an article here that you recommend.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040]   What?
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.040]   Wait a second.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.800]   So I have to follow Vic.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:46.000]   You got Facebook on-- you got Facebook instant articles on your Android now?
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]   It looks like an iPhone 4.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000]   No, no, no, no, it's a very old iPhone.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000]   It's a phone.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000]   On the iPhone, okay.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000]   I guess--
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000]   Oh, that is.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000]   What's your account?
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]   So you do a 1,000 thing.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000]   1,000.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000]   Okay, ready?
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000]   All right.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000]   Click.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.440]   1,000, 2, 1,000, 3, 1,000, 4, 5, 1,000, 6, 1,000, 7, 1,000, more.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.000]   8, 1,000, 9 seconds.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   So on the old phone, it aids so buttery smooth.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000]   Oh.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   That's the old phone.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000]   I'm sure.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000]   Wow.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.280]   Well, I don't know.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:22.720]   If I could get-- so if I follow Vic Condotra, he might put-- he put a link.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.480]   Oh, because you have to share it.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.280]   One of these instant news stories, right?
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.280]   I guess so.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   I don't know.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.280]   I tried to hope New York Times would come up.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.280]   This is an NBC story.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.280]   You don't have to.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.960]   You can go to Facebook.com/instant or something.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.720]   Yeah, we did that, but it didn't--
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.720]   That didn't have the story.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.720]   Oh, here it is.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.720]   Here's Vic, the trouble with almonds from NBC News.
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.720]   Hey.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.720]   That was him right up.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.720]   Okay, but wait a minute.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:44.720]   But no, that's the-- this is the website.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:45.720]   Of course, that came right.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.720]   That's not instant.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.720]   I don't think.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720]   I want to see.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.720]   How do I get the-- is this Facebook-- oh, it is.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:50.720]   This is the Facebook.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.720]   That's it.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.720]   Oh, it is.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.720]   That's Facebook.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.720]   So mine is too old.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.720]   That's why I'm not--
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720]   Yeah, this came up right away.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.720]   I got a web.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.720]   Okay, that's what it is.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:00.720]   By the way, that's kind of interesting, because you wouldn't know you're on Facebook here,
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.920]   except for the like button.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.720]   This looks like a-- there's even ads, NBC News ads.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.720]   Yeah, there's certain ad formats and all kinds of things.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.720]   That is buttery.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.720]   They don't feel like what I saw.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:12.720]   Thank you.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.720]   Oh, it's very buttery.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:14.720]   Oh, that's the stage.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.720]   And the videos auto play as you scroll.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.720]   They do.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720]   So, like, there's the video.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.720]   You know what?
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.720]   This is actually production-wise.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.720]   It's very desirable.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720]   Oh, it's great.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.720]   To me, Jeff, this is like using medium.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720]   You use medium.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.720]   Are you going to--
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.720]   It's beautiful.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720]   Tom Rogers, almond grow.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:37.840]   Part of the story of this is that every almond, every almond, not-- not bunch of almonds,
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:44.040]   not pound of almonds, every almond that you eat is something like six gallons of water.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.040]   You know what?
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.720]   I think there's been a scourge of almonds.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.240]   When I get on the airplane, I miss my peanuts.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.720]   You never get peanuts home or you get almonds.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:52.720]   Yep.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.840]   Can't do the tree nuts, no more.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:00.720]   I was on a plane, a Virgin America plane, where they recalled the peanuts.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720]   What?
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.840]   They were giving us nuts.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.520]   And they said, "Whoa, oh, the pilot came on.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.520]   You have to give back your nuts.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.840]   There's a kid on here who's allergic.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.440]   I was not giving my nuts back."
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.520]   Yeah, that's why you usually get pretzels on lots of flights.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.160]   That's beautiful, Jeff.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160]   It is beautiful.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.160]   That's one good-looking spider, is it not?
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.440]   Like a thunderhead, a-- if that's a thunderhead or a murder--
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.440]   You would have--
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.440]   Wow.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.360]   And you can join the conversation with NBC News, Haley Jackson.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:29.360]   There she is.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.280]   She's talking to me, me personally.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:33.280]   Hi, Haley.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.280]   She's doing a selfie.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:37.040]   I think this Facebook thing is going to catch on.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.040]   Invertical video.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.040]   I'm going to share that for your phone.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]   Specifically.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.040]   I'm going to share this.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.040]   Okay.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.040]   So I can write up post.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.040]   I can send it in Messenger.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]   I can copy the link.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.040]   I can email.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.040]   I can tweet it, which is interesting.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:52.160]   Well, and the sharing menu-- and the sharing menu, I got to give them credit.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.640]   They did add a bunch of things to there.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.640]   It's not just share with other people on Facebook.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.640]   Pinterest and Twitter.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.640]   I think they should have credit for that.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.560]   So I'm going to write-- just if you follow me and a lot of people do, I'm just going to
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:10.960]   write-- here's an example of what do they call this again?
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.960]   It's the instant--
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:18.840]   Of the new instant-- I hate this keyboard.
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:24.200]   News feature from Facebook.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:25.200]   Okay.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:31.040]   Josh Benton, who's a really, really good guy, Neiman, just asks on Twitter, "Would
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:34.320]   anyone know the technology behind their speed?
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.080]   Is it prefetching something else?"
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:39.320]   Well, but you know, you saw I loaded it right away.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.320]   Yeah, I was going to wait.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.320]   I mean, it wasn't like--
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.320]   That's pretty fast.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320]   But of course, it's prefetching.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.600]   Is it working on a iPad, too?
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.760]   I don't know.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760]   I don't believe so.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.320]   Oh, it's only an iPhone.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:59.240]   So what do you guys think about the big giant, huge Facebook with tons of resources, not doing
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.720]   this on two platforms?
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.720]   They will.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.720]   Give them a break.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.720]   Oh, sure.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.720]   Yeah, they will.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.720]   They will.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:09.520]   This is not going to be only on an iPhone.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:14.760]   Well, but it's just-- they don't want to roll it out too fast because then you wouldn't
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.560]   get the buttery experience.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.960]   We never got paper.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.840]   It's one-- yeah, but you didn't miss anything.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:26.760]   It's one way to control how many people use it, basically.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   Right?
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:31.640]   Do you have any idea whether this was a new version of Facebook that had to come down?
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.400]   I don't, unfortunately.
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:34.560]   This was all built in.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:35.560]   I just don't know.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:36.560]   That's a good question.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.560]   That was good.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.560]   That was pretty pretty.
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.560]   It's gorgeous.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.840]   It's like you bought up.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:41.840]   It's like bought up.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.960]   Can you go to the New York Times on your Facebook app?
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   I tried it.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.480]   Somebody has to share it with you, which is-- although I don't know if I'm following
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:54.160]   Vic or not, but let me just look real quickly and see if there is-- I think they tell you
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:58.800]   when there's stuff that's been updated recently.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.800]   Updates.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.800]   Recently updated.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.400]   Did Facebook get recently updated?
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400]   Nope.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.520]   Google Sheets slides and docs are getting updated.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.080]   It doesn't look like that was a recent update.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:14.160]   So that's-- Everyone's the last time Facebook got updated on May 8th, so that was probably
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.800]   the update.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:20.640]   Let's see if they even say in the West News, they don't say anything.
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:25.440]   Every updated Facebook app includes improvements for speed and reliability.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.920]   The update to the--
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.240]   The maps in Butter E.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240]   Butter E.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240]   Butter E.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.240]   All right.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.040]   I didn't mean to add more time here, but that was a lot of--
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.280]   No, I'm glad you did.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.280]   That's great.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:43.000]   Mr. Matthew Ingram, anything you'd like to share is a pick of the week?
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.400]   You don't ask.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.880]   I can't remember--
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.680]   Oh, yes.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680]   Did I freeze?
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   I can offer you one.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.560]   Have I mentioned Google Photos and uploading all my photos?
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.800]   And I know that's not new.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.280]   We do love that, don't we though?
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.560]   The search is great.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.200]   So I've got personal search turned on.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.400]   So I've tried things like my photos of Caitlin, my daughter, and it pulls them all up.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.200]   It's fascinating.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.640]   It's a great-- just for backup purposes, it's a great solution.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.840]   You know, I got to show you this flicker, as you know, just updated significantly.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.400]   Yeah, that's what made me think of it.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   It's capabilities.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.960]   And one of the things Flicker does, which is really interesting, is this automatic tagging
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   feature.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.480]   You have to go to your camera roll.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.680]   I'm going to do that right now on my flicker.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:38.120]   And let's see.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:42.160]   So normally, the default would be a short by date taken.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:45.640]   But there's-- you'll see this tab here that says Magic View.
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.360]   And look how well this does.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.360]   Animal bird.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360]   Here's two birds.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.360]   Animal cat.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.360]   Animal dog.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.240]   This is all done automatically.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.240]   Animal other.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:59.760]   Sometimes there's some mistakes, although there is a donkey there.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.360]   Architecture.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.120]   So imagine uploading all your pictures to Flicker.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.120]   And these are all buildings.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.280]   Cities, sculpture.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.040]   Did a pretty good job of that.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.040]   Towers.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.040]   Look at that.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.040]   They're all towers.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.880]   I got to think Google could do that too, right?
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.640]   Google should do this absolutely.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:20.640]   Absolutely.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.640]   Food beverage.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.120]   Food meal.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.480]   Food vegetable.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.320]   Food other.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:31.320]   Landscape.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.320]   Field.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.080]   Yes, those are all fields.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.080]   Forest.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.080]   Mountain.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.080]   Those are all mountains.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.080]   Rock.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.480]   Well, a pyramid isn't a rock, but it's rock-like.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:42.560]   It's rock-colored.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:43.800]   Here's shore.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.560]   Look at that.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.960]   Snow sunset.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:48.960]   Pretty impressive.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.920]   If you use Flicker and Flicker's free up to, I think, a terabyte of storage, I think this
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.760]   is pretty darn impressive.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:03.720]   I have to say, though, I was a big Flicker user, and the way they changed the UI, which
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.720]   bothered me.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.000]   But also, their mobile apps in my experience are terrible.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.200]   So if I want my phone to automatically upload things, which I do, I want to upload to Google,
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.080]   I want to upload to Dropbox, it happens in the background.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.080]   No problem.
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:23.560]   Every time I try to do that with Flicker, it takes forever, and then something fails.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:29.000]   Everybody has backup, free backup now, everybody.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.040]   So I back up everything everywhere.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:32.480]   Here's all black and white photos.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.800]   This is currently pretty sweet.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.600]   We've got everything at Google, everything at Dropbox.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.360]   Yeah, it's nice to have the backup.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:45.520]   Anyway, I'm glad you mentioned that because I actually wanted to show people that.
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.880]   I think we showed that on the radio show.
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.320]   Chris Markwark told me about it, our photo guy.
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.760]   Jeff, since you obviously have an extra thing, go ahead.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.760]   Throw it in.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:58.360]   I was just going to say that Tuddle Bear now has an app for Chrome.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.360]   Ah, yeah.
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.360]   That's all that.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.120]   So what is Tuddle Bear?
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.840]   Tuddle Bear is a VPN-runish thing.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.400]   So you can watch BBC from the US or U-Math.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.840]   You can watch US stuff from Canada.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.840]   Tuddle Bear is great.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840]   Hotel.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:17.680]   In violation of every law known to man, this is why David Cameron, this is exactly why we
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.040]   have no free speech now.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.480]   It's because of you.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:25.840]   We use Tuddle Bear during, what was it, FIFA, the World Cup?
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:32.040]   I know it was a very popular way to watch curtail online tracking.
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:33.920]   It's VPN.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.920]   And I don't know.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.560]   As you have used it, I haven't used it.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:37.560]   I've used it.
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:38.560]   It's great.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.200]   So it's fast enough where you could watch video.
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:41.200]   Just works really well.
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:42.200]   Yes.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:43.200]   Yes.
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.200]   Yes.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.200]   It's so easy.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.760]   You get a decent amount free.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:47.760]   It's very nice.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.200]   The service is great for the company.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:51.200]   And here's the deal.
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:56.080]   The really good legitimate use is at an open Wi-Fi access spot.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:01.560]   So put it in Chrome, turn it on, and you go to Starbucks and you can now browse with
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:02.560]   impunity.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.560]   Exactly.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.560]   I think that's great.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.560]   Tuddle Bear is also Canadian.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:06.560]   So just by person.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.560]   He looks Canadian.
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:08.560]   He looks Canadian.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:09.560]   It's a nice guy.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.560]   We have a lot of bears.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.640]   Well, you have to create a Tuddle Bear account.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.320]   Have you ever used Hola?
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:16.000]   No, what's that?
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.440]   Hola is a Chrome plugin.
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.360]   And it's really easy.
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.360]   It's really nice.
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.360]   Well done.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.400]   It knows where it kind of incenses that you want to go be illegal right now.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.400]   It does it for you.
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.880]   I want to be illegal right now.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:30.880]   Right?
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.880]   Is that the one?
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.600]   You can say I want to pretend that I'm in Britain or I want to pretend I'm in the US
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:38.160]   don't understand this kind of behavior.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:42.480]   But I'm just saying if you're the type of person for personal reasons who has to pretend
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.200]   to be from a different country.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200]   Right.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.400]   Maybe you're a freedom fighter.
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.400]   Exactly.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.400]   Exactly.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.800]   Doctors without borders.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.200]   That kind of thing.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.200]   Exactly.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:59.720]   You're worried that Ea mean will find out where you live and track you down.
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.200]   All right.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.640]   Tunnel Bear and Hola.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.360]   I'm tunneling privately to the United States.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360]   Okay.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.360]   It'll give you a little data to get started.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:16.960]   So don't use this until you need it.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:17.960]   Right?
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.960]   Right.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:19.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:22.440]   I've used it when I'm out of the country in a hotel room.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:23.440]   That's a great idea.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.160]   Because I actually do pay for it.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.480]   Tunneling privately to the United States.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.840]   Start Bear Housing.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:31.840]   Here's little data.
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.840]   Change countries.
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:34.280]   Oh, this is how you change countries.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:40.720]   You get a little tunnel bear button and you could say US, UK, Canada, Germany, Netherlands.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.720]   Wow.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:50.760]   So you get as much as a 250 to 500 gigabytes a month, I guess.
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:52.120]   And then if you want more, you can pay for it.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:57.040]   But yeah, for like an emergency, that's good.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.760]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis City University of New York.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.800]   Buzz machine.com.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.160]   You the greatest, man.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.400]   Love loving you on the show.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.680]   Thank you also, Matthew Ingram.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:09.880]   I feel the same way about you.
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:10.880]   I'm so glad that you're at fortune.
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:12.240]   Great to have you on, Matthew.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:13.240]   Yep.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.240]   I was never worried.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:20.160]   We knew a premier quality person like you would be working within moments.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.880]   I bet you had to.
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:22.880]   I bet it was kind of fun.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:23.880]   You had all these offers.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:25.480]   You could field all these offers.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:31.920]   It actually, you know, once I got over the sort of the grief of the way that things ended,
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.160]   it was nice to hear from lots of people who I hadn't considered before.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:40.320]   So it was a little like being around at your own funeral.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:41.320]   It's validating.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.600]   Well, yeah, no, it was nice.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.040]   You deserve to be validated.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040]   So that's great.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.200]   Thank you.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.440]   Thank you for being here.
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:49.440]   Fortune.com.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.640]   Matthew I on the Twitter.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:51.640]   Thank you all for watching.
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.840]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, right after Windows weekly.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.000]   Usually it's, you know, it's supposed to be 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.480]   I'd say it's more like 1.30.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:05.240]   It won't miss anything if you turn it on 1.30.
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:06.240]   Let's be honest.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:07.240]   Let's be fair.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:12.720]   1.30, 4.30, that's a 20.30 UTC.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:13.720]   Twit.tv.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.880]   If you can't watch live on demand audio and video, always available after the fact that
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:20.920]   twit.tv/twig or where you get your stuff.
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.320]   Is this, is it?
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.320]   It's, yes, it's too.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:29.400]   I was going to, foolishly was going to say something about the t-shirt, but it's gone.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.880]   Oh, I should have said something yesterday.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.000]   Let me just see t-spring.com/twit.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000]   Ah, sold out.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000]   What?
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000]   Damn it.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000]   I'm sorry.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000]   Oh, sorry.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000]   Dang it.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000]   Dang it.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.360]   Oh, well, we'll do something else.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.360]   We always do something cool.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:49.680]   Just keep that bookmark that and check by once in a while.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:52.040]   t-w-e-spring.com/twit.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.800]   That was the 10th anniversary twit-shirt.
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:59.200]   The new screen savers is Saturday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.040]   Father Robert Ballisair hosting.
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.920]   If you've got a question for Father Robert, we do, we do.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.120]   You take calls on the show.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:07.680]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.960]   And you just have to email us ahead of time to let us know.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:10.960]   You have a question.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:11.960]   We'll pick you and call you.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:12.960]   We want to set up Skype.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.120]   Make sure it's working.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.680]   The email address is newscreensavers@twit.tv.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680]   Sorry?
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:23.400]   Are you going to bring back call for help?
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.880]   You know, I thought about it briefly and then I thought, you know what?
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.480]   I don't need to because really that's what we do with the radio show, the tech guy shows
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.240]   call calls all the time.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.960]   So that's unnecessary.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:38.840]   That's when the first time I was on your show was in the basement of the Omni TV building
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.840]   in Toronto.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:40.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.040]   Oh, did you come in?
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.240]   Two years ago was that.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.240]   I did.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:45.240]   I came in.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.720]   I was at the Globe and Amber MacArthur brought me in for a second.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.240]   That must be where we met.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.400]   I'll be diggity danged.
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:52.400]   That's great.
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.680]   Yeah, that was many, many decades ago in a galaxy far away.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.120]   Well, it wasn't that about 2004 to 2005, something like that.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.120]   Ten years ago.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.840]   I think this is a brand new variety show for a new generation of tech enthusiasts.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:09.280]   And it's a lot of fun and I hope you'll watch.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.280]   Thank you, Matthew.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.280]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.280]   Thank you for watching.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:20.520]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.520]   Bye bye.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:28.560]   I will be on the show next week and then the following week I will be there.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:29.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.360]   Hey, Google I/O. I didn't mention our Google I/O coverage.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:37.960]   930 AM on a Thursday, two and a half hours, May 28th.
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.320]   Yeah, it's going to be a long one.
